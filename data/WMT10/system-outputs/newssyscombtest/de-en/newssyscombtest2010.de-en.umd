snow on the mountains lack haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose runways during Sorgenn not only the giant mountains-residents.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering the ski stays in hotels and guest houses.
That is why we in giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people who go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid, compulsory.
And if you ask us to call them immediately, whether we believe that this Christmas will be on snow or "Matsch", the operators of the information portal Spindl. info, Martin Jan Dura.
The New Year's Eve, who stay in the Spindel mill just after his ideas will, should no longer with the appointment of hesitation.
Anyone who prefers the save and the quality of the stay in second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
The Spindel mill hotel owners offer now for the New Year's Eve day mostly stays only weeks.
I think that you try to sell it for a time, but then you also have to give, and for shorter periods.
And then there are the free room quickly disappear, Jan Dura. estimated
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the travel office ING tours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are interested in the most Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our supply is about half of the jobs are still free.
That is why we have already prepared a cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents ING tours, Petr Schiefert, an.
The new day in giant can offer the Vrchlabi-travel office also, but there is less free seats.
Find good (the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that in giant is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the year without snow in the mountains.
Should the runways during within a week Verschneit, will also be sold from the Christmas, thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages the horizon room in the Hotel in Pecpod Snezkou to fill.
We have about five per cent more than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas Day, we only have a few free room.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in the Janua, and in February, will run the business well informed, the director of the best PEC-hotels, Karel Rada.
About 80 per cent of the New Year's Eve stays is also the Omnia hotel in central car park in Janske Lazne occupied.
On the other hand, is Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half the beds free.
pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for the moment we are already filled to about 60 per cent.
A little weaker is now in February, but in the moment, when the snow comes, in the rising interest in the visits to the giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a greater snow mess for the giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it is cool and if there is rain, should be the snow on the mountains.
But, then again, a warming, informed Jiri Jakub sky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of the intelligence
It is almost comical, with which pupils Strebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, he repeatedly even for the most stupid.
When he finally made his eagerly-awaited Afghanistan-Ausschwitzte doctrine, it is that he showed on the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario Abschrieb three years ago.
Not only that, in the text itself, he repeatedly used the phrase "as" in Iraq, he has even the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush-idea-to send fresh troops quotas in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq-as "irresponsible and in their conclusions Kara trophic criticized decision".
In the following months, but showed that the recommendations of the military, Bush-the only possible strategy and was very successful in the sense that we are now in the news on Iraq no longer speak.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because he has left his successor with a much Dankbarere situation objectively, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent of troops have asked him again the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley Mccristal, even despite the subordination protecting habits the vacillating harshly criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers, in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president postponed three months, but it is to come up with a better idea, and so he has the general Weni tens of 10,000 soldiers.
In Europe, he has pressed the promise of another 5,000, even if it initially at least 10,000 expected.
highly problematic to the whole of the Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete the process within three years. the whole Obama doctrine left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq will be halved.
Also, despite the brother is the Iraq war in recent years-society relatively well-structured, honor the values of their leaders.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the counter indication-it can rely on anyone and there will be no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, which are accustomed to change their mind, every day.
The political institutions, even when they have been formally set up correctly, that leaves only buildings, behind which the patriarchal, tribal relations continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the lack of transparency of the conditions, the Pakistan and Iran-influences more complicated.
The build of a "strong state", which is the minimum target of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his charitable
Over the last eight years has only worsened the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the verge of explosion.
We believe that the small, the soldiers broke out early in the war on the "Homecoming" is to create a miracle here, can only really a romantic soul, not be influenced by facts.
From a political point of view is the date set for the withdrawal of troops from irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans, to participate in the war in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and do not want their voters also say that the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain buffer zone.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation radically, is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, there is a very serious question of whether the United States is to solve the problem with troops.
This question must be answered in the period, in the America after Obama the winner is withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only sticking plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, this would prove to be a total loss. Fallls
The manager of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses in cash bonuses more
The chief executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses this year bonuses more in cash.
The company has announced that responded to the sharp criticism of their pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers get stock instead of the money, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be stripped of the managers in the case, if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so, according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of the effort, the premium of Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former JPMorgan banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, an.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism for the first three quarters of this year, after they had set aside almost $17 billion for bonuses, bonuses.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today, despite the measure likely exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a series of L�Nders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bankers' bonuses, exceed the 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 per cent. unique
similar steps are also preparing to France.
In this year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have today in Stockholm in the hands of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf, this year's Nobel prizes in the technical categories and accepted for literature.
In addition to the four women scientists was among the German writer Herta M�ller, Romanian origin, including.
The Nobel prize for medicine have two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider and Jack Szostak, together with their countryman for the research in the Chromosonen-area.
The price for chemistry has the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for raising awareness of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin, the Nobel Prize for economics, the American Elinor Ostrom and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only specialist category, in which a woman this year was a Nobel Prize in physics.
This price, the scientists today Charles Kao for research in the field of fiber optics, and George Smith together with Willard Boyl scored for the CCD-chip-invention, which is the basis of all digital Kamm eras, fax machines or astronomical Fern pipes.
Each of the winners, a diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of the prize money.
The average in every category of ten million Swedish kroner.
If there are several winners in each category, the prize money will be divided among them.
As is the tradition, the US president, Barak Obama, the most expected this afternoon, already the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.

Minister Janota considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Castle
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning, receives the finance minister Eduard Janota, on the left in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form, as this has been released by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the remain of Janota in office the issues will be on Friday's meeting.
The budget will also criticized by Mr Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, was also further deepen the crisis in the public finances.
on the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On another will remain in his role will be Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget-law, which is now receiving Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
in the parliament, but the left-wing party proposals on Wednesday to vote money revolution and the money for the state civil service salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and directly pay the farmers.
The government has concealed the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
between the left-wing party on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and party, on the other hand, is a sharp domestic political dispute, of the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-Cabinet officials, on whose design is the ODS and CSSD and the Green party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it has been adopted by parliament, the package of austerity measures being wound up by the fishermen have been imposed in the autumn, and the government to put an end to their understanding of the state debt.
Klaus, under the letter of the law on the state budget, but not to have breakfast with the entrepreneurs, said today the discussion, that the politicians the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" the public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his view, there is no longer a good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, it could still rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The UDF leader, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrifying, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS-Petr Necas, deputy chairman, said the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet officials, with the support of the ODS and CSSD, Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier fishermen in the editorial described similar words as a "strong being".
The CSSD leader Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek-words that the budget deficit is terrifying, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and beyond the 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday the CSSD described the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene shows much of the country," the world of the struggle and triumph, despite some criticism that the main role has been occupied by an American actor.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela. told
The tireless campaigner against the racist Apartheid system of government in the Republic of South Africa, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history, the American Oscar-actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the one 90 -year-old Mandela, whether he could be in the Eastwood film.
A more important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The two -year-old actor, the price for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the box area had received "Million Dollar Baby", was the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end of the slave owners, a fictional US president, and also in "Evan omnipotent God", but only rarely, someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African leader was for his active career in the end of apartheid in the South African republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to Undf�R four years he was president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "Ungeschlagen", and at the same time, is the name of a Gedichtes the English writer William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film presents a real moment of Nelson Mandela in his forces with the captain, Francois Pienaar, the South African rugby team, joined together in order to unify the country. the new President Mandela knows that his post-apartheid still race of people and economically divided. remains
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, among the outsiders, some in the world.
Finally, the South African team is rising up in the world of the year in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had no other purpose than to play this role so this as closely as possible, in order to move closer to the reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he.
The actor said, would be if he and the rest of the world, politicians in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him to evening and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important was for him, Mandela to shake hands.
I have noticed that when I say the hand Sch�Ttele, I accept your energy, you will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what they feel, he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film Fran�ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, as he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I opened the door bell rang that he and the first thing I said to Fran�ois Pienaar in my life, was: ' in the film I see much more from '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critics of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well from managed film."
In the film reviews on the Web-sides RottenTomatoes.com, Invictus 76 per cent received positive evaluations.
The secret of Norway: the Russians have tested a missile dissolved
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But the start was not successful and described as a type "Bulava missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slow to the nightmare of the Russian generals and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
also repeated its presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
launched Bulava is usually not at all or in the air has been damaged.
In the Russian newspapers, it has been on "Bulava missile" than a ", which do not fly".
A missile, which do not fly, but understand
This was already 13 attempt at the beginning. normal
Only at the end of the flight are technical damage occurred to the rocket.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This "launched Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missiles to the shooting down of the U-boat.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified Fliegendes object on Norway was actually the damaged "Bulava."
In addition, the Norwegians have since the first time no doubt that there is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generals has challenged and claims that man cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not affected and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Even if a test start without error, is still in charge of the defense ministry only six of 13 for success.
almost 50 per cent of the success that the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems, and even fly to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed with 51 years a year contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov, with 51 years ago again in a professional ice hockey game.
The former Olympic and world champion, Stanley Cup-holders will help his team CSKA Moscow in the duel, and probably not even in the Friday KHL to St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, with 40 years of his career, in 1998, has been completed, is the current president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need only to clarify some of the rest of the formalities, the agency quoted AP coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only a game.
I believe that this is Fetisov, to raise the standards of other players, players Nemcinov.
If Fetisov area, he will be back on the ice after AP the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe with 51 years played a season for Hartford, 15, and hit and 26 Assistenzen letter.

The management of the Nosovice car plant Hyundai agreed with the union to the lifting of all the overtime.
because often here overtime, the union announced the willingness to strike on Monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The executive will, however, with the trade unions to come to an agreement on a Saturday class this week.
We must not give up our production plan, it is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, 19 December, volunteers worked overtime proposed for the reason that two working groups would be, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka. cz, wrote that the company's staff, which would work Saturday class, has offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff also receive the event for the Saturday class on 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided that the motivation of staff for the proposed change overtime.
Either you pay the overtime pay or you can substitute for holiday on 28 December, and so extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek on.
In addition, all of the staff of the Saturday section the fares and lunch.
With that in mind, that the overtime the most urgent and burning point about demands and complaints of trade unionists who had ceased production last week, the business leaders yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all the overtime for the month of December, VanK decided on.
The staff of the car factory until last week had been, practically every day after the eight-hour class, 2 to work overtime.

Czech discovery: a substance, even in the ' steel ' HIV viruses effect
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds, which are intended to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are already resistant to drugs.
This fact against outweigh the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants are not so stark, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS could not be cured.
The patients the drugs together, but can prolong the lives and prevent the increase in the number of HIV virus in the body.
But their income will be accompanied by a series of side-effects.
The development also has partial suppression of the virus reproduction SG. lead to resistant viruses, not against the drugs are more effective.
The work of the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, CR experts from the Vscht (chemically-Technological University), Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how we can deal with the virus-resistant.
They have proven that the protein known as the Metalokarborane substances on the substance, is responsible for the increase in HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links of boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links to block the virus reproduction in other ways than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
in their work, the scientists to new ' improved ' links, on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their commitment to the viral protein material were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique structure of three: two Vielf�Chige cages, which consist of boron-hydrogen and carbon atoms, and by a metal atom, cobalt, in this case are linked.
Heimt�Ckisches and constant virus
HIV protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus-caused by the HIV protease division would not mature infectious virus particles.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers explain in the press, the report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences, CR.
In the work, the newspaper in the science journal of medicinal chemistry was published, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) are linked by a brief organic chain, which will continue systematically changed.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this number of substances against the HIV protease Wurdne tested in place, also against their constant (resistant varieties), which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not so stark, as used in the clinical medicine, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant varieties, used against the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, power Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research on the development of effective medicines to combat HIV, says Pavlina Reza Cova, head of the Institute for organic chemistry laboratory for structural biology and biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the National Academy of Sciences.
dispute over budget. ODS fishermen, the fights back
The chairman of the ODS of Mirek Topolanek, called approved the budget for the next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, his opinion should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the prime minister as a "strong being".
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, officials said that the concept of the cabinet, with the support of the ODS and CSSD, Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in the parliament, if it is the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically contrary, Necas has indicated.
The House on Wednesday approved the budget for the year 2010, however, with left-wing party-change proposals on more than 12 billion kronor.
The parliament has the money for salaries, state officials for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has concealed the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional budget. Frase not clear
frustration and futility.
The finance minister Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation for the case would have threatened that the amendments were approved, the situation would be different.
In accordance with the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the government rules the premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
The reason this is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of budgets.
The fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Nominanten Necas the Social Democrats (CSSD), the enforced changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if parliament adopts continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, the law should be changed, sick pay and pensions or the service.
Topolanek wrong: the minister nominated by ODS is not
That is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and throughout the government.
The prime minister have made no mistake, nominated by the ODS, Topolanek in a text message from the United States.
It has been said that in some of the ministries in deputy function people sit, the top 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas said that if fishermen decide in favor, to the fight against the deficit-level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority in parliament is at the moment".
He then allegedly can count on the support of Democrats and tolerance of the citizens do not.
I have not thought about it, and if the date will be, I will be dealing with it, the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak said the journalists in parliament.
Premier fishermen afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels. flew
The ODS resigned at the request of the prime minister.
At the same time that the ODS Necas said would probably vote against the revised budget in parliament on Wednesday, the Democrats explicitly ask members of the public if the prime minister would be to allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not orphans, as we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the leader of the party in the parliament and in the Czech Republic was not pushed back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I have been on the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, particularly for Bolshevism of the parliament and the destruction of everything would be positive, Topolanek responded.
The new map of the CD (Czech railways) will be fewer trains travel for roughly the same fare.
The Czech railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some less at full capacity-and local trains, other links to be strengthened.
The whole transport scale will apply from the day of the new road map compared with reduced by two per cent today.
Most of the tariffs incl. basis-and customers driving collective will not be changed.
Several combination opportunities in the capital, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava-area, the railways, the type Pendolino trains on this route.
The train will no longer to Bratislava (the).
less fast trains will also be on the Prague-Pisek, Budweis, in principle, be the direct links from Prague to Letohrad reduced.
The largest reduction plant the railway in the District of Hradec Kralove (King Graz), for a total of eight per cent, to an increase in can look forward to the Prague and environment.
Prague-lifted two night trains on the route Tabor, Budweis, and on some days in the week of the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague-Pisek-reduced Budweis.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new transport road directly from Milo vice to Prague, now have the inhabitants of Milo vice in Lysa nad Labem switch.
It is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the Rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem Milo vice is possible.
The long distance routes in the capital will be in the end goal-station Prague main station.
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino trains between Prague and Ostrava and the after Sumperk/Jesenik, in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transport, as a whole, the railway to the foot of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kronor in Genaus this year. local trains provide the districts, they have to pay for the next year a total of eight billion kronor, while giving the state three billion.
In the suburban 200 million Czech crowns more expensive this year.
For the local trains and the fast trains, the rail has completed a ten-year new treaty until the treaty has now been completed, only for a year.
the praises of the rail system, so perhaps it also has not resorted to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
It is only to changes in one mobile network seem CD net and favorable Internet driving seem Eliska.
For passengers without the customer card will be the price CD net increased from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price Eliska will depend on the drive was, until now, it has been claimed for travel between any cities in the same district, 160 kroner.
Philippine Milli aunt take more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Milli aunt kidnapped in the southern Philippines today 75 people, including a number of primary school pupils and their teachers.
This has led the AFP agency, which was originally only about 65 abducted informed.
All 17 children held have been released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the Agusan del Sur province.
Around 19 Milli aunt living allegedly used the hostages as a shield on the run from the police.
The local negotiators are now seeking the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency the Milli aunts are among the New People's Army (NPA), this is the weapon of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).

Jan said worry about this in a 20-minute Inteview on the radio journal.
The case is linked to the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions, but ultimately the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways.
All three leaders, us and say that we take the cherry-picking out, we have the only offer on the scale, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we as the Czech railways are expensive, because we know the price of Czech railways would have been completed, the previous week.
So, we have no choice but to defend.
Because of this defamation of the society student agency, said Jan worry about the radio journal.
At the same time he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection of the criminal proceedings for the further the medial show by Jan Cura, it serves as a free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I would urge other head on.
I assume that this matter will be clear that it is Jan Cura, in the matter of the regional scrapheap rail manipulated the public and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jan Cura already reported last week that he had invested several million kronor in the advertising on the negative, will step out of the districts.

Because of the criticism of the trains in the districts of threatened him, according to Jan Cura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do that then we can also lose the bus licences.
He was a member of the CSSD before, I know, for whom it is, I am not saying his name, said Jan today worry about the radio journal.
vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken change from January, the usual.
It is a first for the families be free of charge and voluntarily.
But now have, that the mandatory-vaccination would be effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The Institute of Medicine sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccination.
Vaccines for August. children free of charge
From January, children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The St, provided that they have not received any vaccination dose.
Anyone with the vaccination has already started in the last year or earlier, further repetition of vaccination for themselves.
The first vaccination dose must be given to between 3 and 5 live month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children four doses are needed.
All in all, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine between 300,000 and 450,000 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment, the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has set vaccination for all the children spent around 500,000 per year.
The mandatory-vaccination was introduced with the so-called "Janota package.
Pneumokokken cause middle ear inflammation, but also a serious infections including skin Inflammations brain and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokken infections die in the US to investigate in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty-vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could in future be duty.
In January it should be paid for by the insurance companies and voluntarily.
That the mandatory-vaccination would be better, for example, said the head of the Citizens Association close Las, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association, for the Pneumokokken vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the International Conference, which was involved in our Association, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite the ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed is, at least the.
I believe that this is the way that we have to go now, Kalovsky.
The Department of Health will but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken not change.
In this moment we consider this is not at all, said his spokesman, Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The chairman of the Society of practical children doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, is that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then reflect on the reduction of vaccination number "could be in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has launched a voluntary," says Allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 per cent of parents their infants inoculated against Pneumokokken next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this is also the first set vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for the prevention, so save it for further treatment, Erk�Rt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But it is a concern for the practical children doctors linked to the purchase of the vaccines.
Under the original plan, the vaccines are purchased by the insurance companies and doctors should receive it in the same way, as well as other issued by the state to make vaccines.
But some members feared that the insurance so "the money out of the health insurance could lead".
That is why the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance pay for them.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners need to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum of money.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
They and we still
The Islam can be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when the Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and the widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is, John Bowen, an American academic, a well-written and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most avowedly S�Kularisier societies-and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why not scarves the French love" (original title: "Why the French don't like headscarves read") (2006), an elegant and densely Argumentierenden study of a dispute, which divided the country on one-and-a-half decades and employees and whose effects are still visible today.
Bowens Neustes book offers a more comprehensive and bold more range.
As a good anthropologist, he not only want to know what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening on the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic free" offer.
He is a good listener, it debates between teachers and students about the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a town hall (or both)? marry
Young Muslims should be lectured on evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, an interest-oriented banks to take advantage of the system, in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane affairs, he claims, the day-to-day life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams and intellectuals, teachers, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholars and academics, born in Switzerland.
This new generation of trying to open up the debate about how it is possible a good Muslim, on the one hand and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who are interviewed Bowen, disagree with their most Salafi counterparts -- supporters of Puri, the fundamentalist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia -- the Today show a small but influential Muslim presence in Europe.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a Convention requires give and take on both sides.
The question is, to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate guarded the separation of church and state) really feel the commitment to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees a tightening of the screws "values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
The Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "Yes, but not yet".

The US government contractors by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor to the US government, mobile phones, notebook-computer sold in the country, arrested, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.
The contractor, which until now could not be identified, working for development alternatives, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
consular officials representing the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although Cuban right a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of "risk" can be arrested.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the easy protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti- government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani S�nchez, the often describes how she and her husband are followed and attacked by government representatives.
S�nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country, prices to increase, but this has been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably be the tension between the Communist government in Cuba of Castro's brother and the Obama administration to increase the "slow" approach had sought to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by The New York Times reported.
The new US policy has stressed that the United States will provide a return, if the Cuban government took concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create space for the opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salaries of government employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone this year, they will be used for the sending of text messages, mainly as a 15-minute telephone conversation a day would cost.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect their names, often the government report.
Too many Web sites the access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American rarely.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a press spokesman for the US-interests in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society-the tax-free mobile phones in Cuba is a crime, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch," the recently a harsh report about the freedom in Cuba with the title "new Castro, Cuba also brought out", an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, which replaced the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that, very often, the defendants were arrested, convicted and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, especially at a time when both countries for more dialog move closer together.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet men to send to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leaders on Saturday, the head of a conspiracy aimed at, five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan, in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist recruitment agencies to search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had sought a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, that the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made it out, because one of them on the Internet video, YouTube had made supportive comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the birthplace of al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday the al Qaeda leader, Saifullah could not convince, that the men are not part of a conspiracy to undermine the CIA terrorist network.
As a result, on days they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist safe haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to try to get the right advice, in order to maintain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of five men-which are still in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI-highlights the pivotal role of gangmasters in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, the decision on who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret service has made to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Gangmasters act as guardians of the organization, not those who let, whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits from a Qaeda a specific test, analysts said.
because of their potential access to US-and its propaganda value, but they are also seen as hugely attractive to the group.
Analyst Evan Kohlmann, rang the highest the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said in recent years that terrorist groups are also much more cautious with regard to become who you allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If we tried to send anyone in these groups, we could go, what better way than to follow the recruitment model, which so many have followed, Kohlmann said.
The model is much more now on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators calling for in Copenhagen climate - "action."
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and called for more of the negotiators in the Bella conference center in the city of bold action on climate change.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000. rather
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosives in the proximity of some government buildings in the city Z�Ndete.
On a day when supported by the UN climate negotiations, little happened, thousands of activists with banners by the city, which was "there is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish, said that "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest at the Danish model, for example, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birth country your mother, your mind, with the type of heart problems the country has already significantly due to the effects of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take part in a major demonstration-in order to pass on the floor and an appeal to world leaders to bring a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around more, which is why.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket knife with.
According to Danish law these actions in demonstrations are banned.
According to a witness, who did not wished to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, burned several detonators disguised demonstrators in black clothes in the vicinity of the Copenhagen's main channel, near where several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the building, he said, and added that it began as a flashing neon missiles, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
The people gathered in the home of the Congress Center from television screens, and the whole afternoon to monitor the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su, as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations in English, he replied: "This is something that I was not even aware".
He was then in Mandarin and said: "because of the venue is great, I can not hear what is happening out there".
He noted that from the perspective of the individual hillsides, whether the demonstration would help or harm.
It shows the concentration of various sectors and the general public on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
test data showing persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that in the last two years, the fourth-and Achtkl�Ssler faster progress than cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, including National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of the White Viertkl�Ssler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 on 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtkl�Ssler remained basically the same, he fell to a statistically significant point of 245 at 244.
The average score of white students has not been included in the test, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture on a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertkl�Ssler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 large-scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score, the children of both groups have achieved, in this period has grown, has hardly been reduced the difference with now 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed their concern that the results of Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty was celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, are already strong children, have been taken.
This suggests that the overall assessment by the treatment of those who have raised the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the management board of DC Voice, a nonprofit group, the for the education equality in Washington D. C..
I will not for a period of two or three points and down, said the Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter, in the fourth class of Eaton-primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said examination of the figures, the message is that the secondary schools the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we always see the positive signs, I respect.
But as far as I am concern, is that we are not close to spend time and energy that we need to use our resources for school.
Rhee said, the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of vulnerable pupils to be.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to read a new curriculum, read the Wilson-to use the system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not mastered at the start of their school career, and the significantly behind its peers classmates.
everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth-class games and real life experience to the fore, was among the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and the curriculum to be some progress the NAEP, which last week reported were attributed to that.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the benefit to the students below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the issue, whether Rhee can continue to do so, to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to be the extra money and resources can be made available for the weak performance schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional medicine is, its resources and management reforms at the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions, working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a great school system.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city neighborhoods, so that all families, regardless of where you live, you can be sure that their children will be able to receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap, is the traditional public school in Washington, which now amounts to 180 days extend, in order to compete with the charter schools.
It must be the increase to nearly 200 next school year, in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with its teachers' union last year came to an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg-college with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, from rising and Blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and The emerald green turf.
Gracielas parents have not completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela had, in Silver Spring has been recovered and now living in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtkl�Ssler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, was a reverence full visitor, rather than the future of enthusiastic students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" said they thought, as the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school has been reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States, his panicked immigrants will not end the high school or pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands, which receive college training, which is necessary in order to emerge in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans college -- which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents who are immigrants, mostly from Mexico or Central America, arrived in the United States, without the high school to have concluded.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study strong children, say, this often have a natural affinity for the success of the school and a driving force in them.
Many of them also have parents who give their children set high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advice programme also has a major role to play, by Graciela and millions of children as they help the college to come, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in search of the way through the system, then there will be a single measure does not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia G�Ndara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, the Hispanic American students studied.
We have to think about it, a support network for these children from kindergarten to the high school to provide.
The federal program, the Gracielas college-funded tour, is a useful example.
It is known as gear up-a gang run high-and is more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college-preparation programme to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school are continuing and, until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% of in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies. 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has concluded Saturday in two auctions can get more oil companies, to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 with foreign oil companies contracts of the Iraqi �Lministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been crippled by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies have shares in only two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for the participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The sparsely Ges�Ten representatives of American oil companies in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US-Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further bids for a long time in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies probably stopped, said analysts, is more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies were in some cases discriminated against, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum, Inc. were the only American companies, could complete the contracts with the ministry.
major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry with technical advice on the side, and in the last few years are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts under this weekend.
The state-run China National Petroleum Corporation, for more contracts, than any other companies with large packages of contracts for two more fields, and go home.
We all know, the spokesman said the �Lministeriums, Assam jihad that China is on the way, one of the world's major economies, as well as a technology makes it to be.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its measure with bidders can and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
demands for the levy to be elected companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to the emissions each field to increase beyond the current level.
top Al Qaeda planners apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attacks along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan should be killed a top Al Qaeda operational planners this week, representatives of the US counter-terrorism reported on Friday.
This would be, if it is confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh Al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region have been killed by a number of missiles, which on Tuesday in their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the North Waziristan province.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type, which is used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.

locals, who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the point and took everything quickly, which completely destroyed by the "bodies" was left.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism needed evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading Al Qaeda military planners, the operations of terrorist groups outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wanted to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the American air attacks on Pakistani soil. referred
If his central role as a given, it also contained the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions of the top leaders of an Al Qaeda operation and in planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American said that Somali officials quickly in the al Qaeda hierarchy's is used and the best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said officials of the second, but this does not reduce the risk, the ER for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be Somali, since September the second leading al Qaeda or Taliban leader has been killed in a similar attack, as Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The tempo of attacks by drones the CIA is since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website operated by a nonprofit organization, has fallen from an average of six operations on two per month.
The decline is based on improved tactics of terror groups, have taken the steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time in the brutal killing suspected informers, reported the side.
senior UN envoy in Kabul will be back.
The top UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, supported by the UN the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
oath lost, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could encourage other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The engagement must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian workers to help in Afghanistan's political conversion.
The troops increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he should resign his office, but only a grant agreement in March 2008 with his family, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now pass, so that they have time to bring in a replacement.
What I have said, is that he better start to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, it was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, in accordance with UN representatives started the search for a replacement.
UN officials say that it is the Swedish-Italian-descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Gu�henno, the previously UN-led peace operations, has been taken into account.
oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test, after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that the allegations by Galbraith was fired-the - "have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because a great deal of skepticism in relation to the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative, to coordinate the aid of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allows his successor to employ more staff from the United States and other Western countries, the donations for the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide has expressed his disappointment over the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome un-employment arrangements have undermined its ability to introduce capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I could, he said, only one person since May.
This is disastrous and should not go on.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not taken part in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options for the election in Iran, he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that I am on the soul is, if we in the last six years have learned something from the Iraq war, the unpredictable voice of its own."
Consider the Obama administration prefers a sanctions package that is aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives, both positive and negative" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it with nuclear weapons in reality is less protected," because "the people will suffer terribly" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders joined in the warning that Iran needs to rely on "credible" consequences if it does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council over its nuclear programme and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes only to be won.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and an essential part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement, in order to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
But Iran appears to have to leave negotiations to the provisional agreement since this time -- for the most part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed at the beginning of October, has simply left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, brought together in such a way, as it did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31 Dec. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he and other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "crippling sanctions" will continue.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian Mission to the United Nations, was it "baseless and unfounded allegations" some security council members on Thursday called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before it in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with representatives of the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and because the distribution of revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid delays in the US plans to reduce the American troop strength of 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay concern about the impending withdrawal of troops, the Kurdish. US representatives cited Gates, Masud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will be its security, its prosperity and their autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters, the lecture you thought that "Mother Earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "one more baby means a grab more".
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, die by the low birth rate and aging population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples Ermunterten, to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no way".
We have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing more, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously Dicklichen, spoiled individual children who are affectionately called "little emperor", has led to a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN is.
Department of population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 by 16.7 per cent of the population is expected to rise to an explosion of 31.1 per cent by the year 2050. This is much higher than the global average of around 20 per cent.
The imbalance is in the wealthy coastal cities, with educated population, such as Shanghai, more.
Last year, 60 years and older accounted for almost 22 per cent of reported living in Shanghai, while the birth of a child-per-couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Population and Family Planning Commission said that couples in the reproductive age have to have babies, in order to help "to reduce the proportion of the aging population, shares and to alleviate the labor shortage in the future".
Shanghai will soon "so old -- but not so rich -- such as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
a gradual easing of tensions.
enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples, the breach of this policy, with huge fines -- to their three year content in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese government officials have attributed to this policy is that the critical country demands on natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to Abzutreiben.
Many couples have had to carry out sex-selective abortions, which an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for people have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed exceptions to the rule -- including more city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife have been individual children -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard moderated slogans.
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Beijing Institute of Population Research at the University, said that government officials have even discussed on radical changes recently to allow couples, for example, two children, in which one partner is individual child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
posters, the families Belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how we can apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out urban family planning officials and volunteers for couples to visit homes and information sheets in through the doors.
They also asked about, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
disappointing reaction.
Although officials from a rural town in the outside areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the requests from couples to recognize is that after the start of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts reported no change.
In the community Huinan go with a population of 115,000, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign is still around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and it is also legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West, the one-child policy, wrongly as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, his wife is pregnant with their first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for your hesitation.
Wang, the staff director, said she would like to have a child, because it was an individual child. "We were used to the center of the family and that everyone has cared about us.
We are not used to look for others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 -year-old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents in the small and medium-sized companies with dual career, with the birth rate is falling, he said, is about to be successful and it needs to be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39 -year-olds today, so that their parents grew during the early days of the fighting Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they do not want a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "if the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV to offer the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time to make, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first, which has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to too many victims.
UN-drafting group plan to reduce emissions.
The Fed by the UN climate conference, which up to now by wild postures and mutual accusations was again on Friday with the publication of a document -- a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the industrial nations should shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles could writing, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time is next week, when more than 100 leaders from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was written by a specially created for the UN working group, is silent on the amount of money from rich countries to poor countries should be so that they can meet the short-and long-term global warming.
It also offers a range of options for the key questions, including industry-and major emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how much should be the upper limit of the global rise in temperature, the political decision-makers would support.
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six-page document, has drafted a 180-page negotiating text that summarized in the center, was the leading representatives of the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, has described as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations together their emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions would reduce by 15 to 30 per cent in the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The talks on Friday, the European community has also given a boost by its assurance, over the next three years, $3.6 billion per year, in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change-by the master of the floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
Friday brought the same verbal fireworks, however, the talks had determined in the last week.
The US climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wording, the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions in demand for major emerging countries, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without that major emerging countries stand up and take action, so stern, also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern was his opinion after an hour of the statement of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, said that the leading US climate negotiator either an "lack of common sense" and it was "highly irresponsible" of him that at the beginning of the week, he said that the United States would help China not financially, to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future direction of the great world economic powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the lines. industrialized nations and emerging countries
The current fight relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as on the saving of the planet, with China and the United States for their respective obligations pieces, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved to do so, aggressive action, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic dominance, so ulate, also as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are the most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants in the best-case scenario, say that the talks will lead to a political agreement.
Members of the Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 has a 24-page draft treaty on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive on the small island states' political pressure on the whole political process, "partly because they are now United and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates is focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues still need to be resolved before the arrival of the government leaders to come to an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice-minister Entstiegen their aircraft and rest breaks through the corridors of the Bella-centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated, during the course of the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly, 13,000 people go on a daily basis in the center and from Congress, Gitarre match activists holding late-night shows, in which they are making fun of the countries on which betray their opinion and sell, and draft treaty will be passed from hand to hand, rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just: almost all of the important ministers are now here and on Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km/h quicker train defined the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 o'clock 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness, to announce a train departing, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country for his lightning trip from ash, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then be Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first javelin-commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international network will be faster, more reliable trains Ankoppeln and the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will connect to London.
The neglected province could be living in commuter towns, journey times would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three large parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about damage to the environment in the UK could still put the brakes on high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, and that the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis will report on December 30, according to the Times.
This would give it a detailed route map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London to the West Midlands, with a margin of over five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the approach within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also three options for a major, leading northwards high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The favored option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed line in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland, and another in the North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
a single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a rail insider.
After the completion of the journey times between London and Edinburgh would reduce for 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, the route would not be opened before 2025, would enable the passengers, the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes today, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals offer the opportunity, with a speed of the trains to travel 400 km/h, which the British rail network would be the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-metre trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 branch people can go to.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London-Birmingham route could be in operation.
This in turn would mean a terminus in London that would be needed, on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be dealt.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high-speed network.
rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believe this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he has to set the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains, the first of the high-speed trains on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, and the journey time between London and Scotland would continue for about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be assured, a beacon for the rail revolution.
taxpayers on mortgage for 75,000 pounds-Orangerie a conservative on
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member on the House of Commons, has the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of the Orangerie in the account, he is building in his home in his constituency lies.
The prison spokesman of David Cameron, the party has been reduced, because he is complaining that Commons members' meager rations "have to live, their mortgages has increased by 75,000 pounds to a wooden-workshops to build growing on his second home in Rutland.
He was the taxpayers pay the additional interest in the bill, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons have approved the applications at the time and they have also been called into question by Sir Thomas Legg to carry out a review of the members of the House of Commons expenses. Duncan said last night that "not even cleaner or could have been clearer".
Duncan, one of the richest House members, has a Zweist�Ckiges house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
In the nearby, houses have a sale price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and eating, but the fees office that the spending control center of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he has grown a winter garden, the Orangerie in the plans as "called".
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges, urged not to increase borrowing to comment.
The committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan the security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) of his London house, which he passed on to his constituency house in 1991, a year before his election to the European Parliament member, had bought.
Documents published this week show that Duncan until March last year around 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest refund.
In April, its claims to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the overall increase in funding the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal level lose RBS-mortgage rate fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where he is still standing.
The latest published by the House of Commons documents show that Duncan in this may still be entitled to 1.250 claimed pound (1,400 euros) per month.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him, as members of parliament after the expenses scandal, he said that "would live on meager rations".
"Basically it means that if you are working for the state, that you live on meager rations and must be treated as S*****E."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I have the whole damn sum can claim, but I do not do it. "

The singer was in the night from Wednesday to Thursday, due to the unhealthy changes caused by the recent intervention again to undergo an operation.
His wife Laeticia has adopted on Friday morning to a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles, in which her daughter goes to school, Jade, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the Department for Orthop�Dische and Trau Mato logical surgery at the H�pital Piti� - Salp�tri�re, Yves Caton�, announced that he would visit the singer in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.

They told us that he had caused the a massacre.
The surgeon in Los Angeles, said that they were completely shocked, said Mr Camus.
I have heard that there may be a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "much too quickly, and this is with the permission of the Paris surgeons traveled to Los Angeles'.
I have with this doctor personally telephoned, he told me that he sees this trip as completely straightforward, but I was very surprised, because I already had two operations band windows behind me, he added.
Shortly before he went on RTL known ", it seems that the singer after the operation without drainage, without anything" would leave the hospital.
Dr St�phane Dela Joux is very well known artists milieu.
It was the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, operating in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he had also operates the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, in a H�Matom after a brain bleeding to Resorbieren.
But it is also a doctor with dubious reputation, the already several times due to poor operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud, has been convicted.
me lawyer Olivier Metzner, the doctors, has described him as a "man without scruples", the "regular" before the chamber board and "everything other than is desirable."
After a few days of silence was Dr St�phane Dela Joux on Friday on his lawyer, me, David Koubbi, a statement.
This said that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative tests would be "normal".
The operation was "no bleeding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, it seems that the tour of the S�Ngers, whose health problems since Letzem summer �Ufen, in question.
It is quite clear that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) is a little too tight, said Mr Camus.
The UDF (Union for French democracy) will be vigorously and calls for the party nouveau centre to no longer use your name to.
The alliance, the party of Fran�ois Bayrou ' s party Modem will be monitored, on Friday on a takeover attempt of the label, once the party founded by Val�ry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the party nouveau centre, Herv� Morin, reacted angrily and under threat of prosecution, asked him to use this document labeling in any more.
Herv� Morin announced publicly its intention to take the UDF Siegel, since he was of the opinion that Fran�ois Bayrou, not worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he had left the hand.
The defense minister, whose party also wanted to partner the UMP is, this strategy on Saturday to confirm to the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of the Herv� de Charette, (former UMP members now get in NC), a claim on the property of the UDF brand, because he was the first this brand in 2004, the Institut National de la Propri�T� Industrielle "has requested.
However, the business center of Fran�ois Bayrou's friends supervised parties UDF Alliance and the silence was clear to understand that they are not expropriate and set a deadline under threat of prosecution, as well as the members of the prime minister, this was not to use more and to transfer the property rights of the brand.
They have issued a number of statements in recent days that they would propose their political movement, take the UDF Siegelzu + +, the parties Alliance, wrote in a letter signed by 19 of 24 office members, including Fran�ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the modem party and the centrist alliance of Senator Jean Arthuis.
It is also believed that they have the right to the name of this movement + nouveau centre, the slogans + the UDF today, to its political material, as well as at the start, leads to their website.
As you know, you have no right to use this label, said the rules instead of the UDF and calls for the party in NC, "without the mention of the name of S�Mtlichem UDF material and (their) website to remove".
We also demanded by Herv� de Charette ", the property rights of the brand to legitimize their legal right to transfer".
If they refuse, we will take action against them, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978 and remind us that Morin and his friends "have made the choice to leave this 2007, in order to create a competing movement, as it had already done other 2002, in order to create the UMP party ' '.
The party nouveau centre, therefore, according to the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la d�mocratie Fran�aise) to use.
They also point out that the last Congress the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party Modem and the creation of a business center for the defense "of the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Val�ry Giscard d'Estaing, has adopted.
Herv� de Charette was concerned, so the business center, "he was, at the time he applied for the brand name has for three years, will no longer be a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent, by the absence of deposit the Akronyms UDF in order to carry out this for themselves.
They continue to bear in mind that this conflict is on the best ways to turn in a criminal offense, and Ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, but in politics, as in life, to make a name for himself, rather than to try to come from the anonymity, by man on fraudulent, takes on a name, the man has no legal rights".
affaire Liliane Bettencourt, Fran�ois-Marie Banier, convicted of exploitation of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist Fran�ois-Marie Banier, in order to determine whether he, as the daughter of the Milliard�Rin Liliane Bettencourt, taking advantage of a weak moment of the 80 -year-old has claimed to be a part of their assets to cheated.
The 62 -year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs will be on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a criminal offense, with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euro will be punished.
In fact, this decision means that it will be a process in this case, the saga is one of the richest families in France, where the mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of the L'Or�al cosmetics empire in the hand.
However, as the 15 criminal ordered a medical examination of the 87 -year-old Liliane Bettencourt, to be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktion�Rin of l'Or�al has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented, during the investigation of the state prosecutor's office in Nanterre.
The doctors should be appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010 to submit a report in the Times give you clear whether, and to what is Liliane Bettencourt, can be found in a state of weakness.
I think that it will undergo these investigations.
I will talk with her, me Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
What the lawyer by Fran�oise Bettencourt-Meyers, me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt, a criminal complaint against Fran�ois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round started, and accused him of artists to have exploited the weakness of its mother for years, is in the form of grants totaling one billion euro bank checks, insurance policies or paintings to be cheated.
In turn, Liliane Bettencourt, always refuted by the photographers have been manipulated to look at it as a long-time friend.
Although the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a big family debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his Klientin letters sent to their lawyer (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Fran�oise Bettencourt-Meyers. mistrust
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt following added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I 15 years, a twice-daily to Banier wrote.
Mrs I have since their marriage can never more speak ".
The state prosecutor's office in Nanterre is, once again, the view that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship in recent days, the judge rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is "fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney. confirmed
Now the court has determined that a verdict after the process on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
manager-revolution or the end of the strategic early education?
If there is no change to the leaders of the major French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its staff, said the position of companies vis � vis consumers before the marketing-revolution: it is certainly the best to join the staff of "values", as it was earlier in the consumer-products of the technicians in work designed to impose.
by the customers in the heart of the revolution, the company has the marketing strategies of the conquest of the markets in the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products to impose separate factors preferences of customers regularly again.
The demobilization of staff can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & Eund, what is even more crucial to the economic intelligence.
In fact, the calls the IU (intelligence) Economique = economic intelligence "of all parties (...) a proactive approach and a future-oriented"; it claims some of the staff, the use of the orders of the authoritarian management completely disagree.
That is why we are calling for a revolution, it would be, the staff at the center of the concerns of the company equal footing with the customers.
The very-related use of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has submitted its pay recipients, this revolution in relation to the management practice suggest?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation for many roundabout, in the process, the first to do what it has always done. ...
also because of the authoritarianism-one of the pathologies of power-increasing proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders have a very simple idea of human behavior.
emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist popular theory, the recently by the American "neuro-science" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and spread through the media.
And it suggests that it is possible, therefore, that the "leverage" (sic) to operate the commitment of staff, confirmed a topical appeared a Le Figaro. fr, Ipsos poll the leaders in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is inadequate for today's world.
The mobilization of factors identify and measure
Instead, a necessary for the proper functioning of the modern business-the adoption of a final view of human behavior. Revolution
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental minutes: for the wage-earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a part of your dreams, as a means to achieve their ambition and their projects.
Now take only the studies from the multi-functional analysis of this idea of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that they set their companies on the basis of a doxa judge them by their perceived image, allowing the company to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
The mobilization of identification and the measurement of these factors can predict the executives of the companies control their "social services", and anticipate and their human resource management once again in the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence is good.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war", Obama praise from law
The American has rights on Friday welcomed the speech on the eve of Barack Obama in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel peace prize to the concept of the "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they sometimes even the subject of a "necessary" war in its recently published memoirs have raised.
The war is, of course, the last of which, I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars has inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way of nine days ago to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the pre-dent have done a very good job ". in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was very well, happy cajoled the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's acknowledged.
In some parts of possessions Eich said this speech quite as historic, gin, rich in the radio broadcast of "the takeaway" has been questioned.
In the past, members of some is seen as a potential candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination for the presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left", the members of the Nobel committee reminded that they "are not free and a price for the peace could not pass if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American" speech.
In addition, that he is a "Kosmopolit", such as "there is power", he referred to it as "an American president", as he pointed out that the Europeans' as living in a security bubble, they do not even have created and they do not do much for their protection, "Gerson said.
Among the few, not committed rights described the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, the speech on the Web site of the National Review online as "boring," grandiloquently and inspiration.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned, as Barack Obama defended the resort to the armed forces.
We wrapped the war under the guise of justice, quite simply, the Massacre of the Innocents, he warns.
The press praised the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the view that the premature Nobel peace prize was awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker, as it is known for his talent, as a "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan to manage the international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama was "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary at the same time".
Drivers: three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week marathon negotiations, the Association of trade unions in the streets and the Tlf-the only one of the employers' organization, which remained until the end on Friday evening to an agreement that puts an end to the strike order and the threat of serious supply bottleneck for Christmas.

The conflict "the company would very much damage" and "it was a fear that it would undermine the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage transport groups (international).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 on 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but once we start small," Patrice CLOs (FO).
The activists are now need to block the supply centers, not more.
"However, it will probably always be some recalcitrant, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The Tlf-Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult "to give this wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, is the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and in 100 to 120 euro for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "an acceptable compromise on this".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs, and the upholding of the overall budget for the road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, to address the subject of 13 monthly salary and the modernization of collective bargaining.
M. Bussereau reminded us that "the fall of the taxes for the employers to the tune of 100 million euro" subject to an amendment of the government on the draft law was corrected the finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the Tlf allows that the agreement for the first of this organization affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension by the minister of labor for the profession as a whole.
This will be the case "in a very short period of time", assured Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The Federation Fntr lambasted a "fraudulent trading", because the 100 million euro "were part of the sector to offset the carbon tax has already been promised".
The secretary of state for transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the bird-eaters in the forthcoming Christmas days not stra Disgruntling, complained to the United Nations.
for the Association Otre threatens the agreement "the small and medium-sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months, a great grab to shovel".

Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
for the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Rightly so. S21 is much more than the deeper, a train station, more than a gigantic construction projects, the city of Baden-W�rttemberg land capital for a decade in utter chaos will plunge. building
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
head stations with tracks end, right in the middle of the city, was seen at the time as a technical fossils of the 19th century, the transport bottlenecks as a modern rail transport, impact because it once took a lot of time, Umzuspannen locomotives from back to front.
A brief, go-go, so is' s go.
And that is why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, a passage about on a stretch of the Trans-European rail station, the main route between Paris and Bratislava, Budapest/is-that is why the slogan of "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the vision of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is in the Hessischen and the Bavarian city is almost impossible, the deeper reality.
However, head of stations have also no longer a-and exit problem, since there are modern trains, locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the ice-new line in Ulm is now being addressed.
country-and local politicians have it.
The rail infrastructure-power with, and also because the risks of the largest single project, the Republic of the taxpayers and not the state company.
cities terms, the project is still reasonably justify.
It is a new area of the city, we believe the computer market graphics of the planners-will be equipped with a lot of green.
for the rail, the transport system is harmful S21.
The transit station and the development are intended for the passenger transport routes, the man-typical 1980s-huge growth brought.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
modern transport policy, but it must first to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport to rail is much more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the road.
But the new route is not because of tough climbs for freight trains.
What is even more serious is that S21 indirectly affected many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros in the Schw�Bischen are buried.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is, in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and closely in the network.
A total of 60 more projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
since 1987, will be built on the route in the slow pace.
would be urgently needed, right here on the tube to push.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rhine valley route is the bottle for the international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport.
The state government has in the Wiesbadener land left open whether it against the judgment of the European Court of Hessischen administration (Vgh revision.) on the night.

Mr Posch, the accusation of Sch�fer-G�Mbel back, the country government attempts to "right Verdreherei and sleight of hand" but still to come to their night.
need a thorough legal review their time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a safe Entscheiung, said Stefan M�ller (FDP).
So, as they are the opposition, the statements of his group the night never been.

Last night, the body on the Personalie vote.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-capital studios in Berlin.
It was a confirmation of the station, however not-officially, in order not to rush the process.
However, have also played a role, the ZDF-controller Markus Sch�Chter not further damage, should also do not get through this proposal to the board of directors.
Frey, Sch�Chters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The outcome of the vote was in editorial end of this issue has not yet been set.
Two weeks ago, was Sch�Chter with his proposal, the treaty with Nikolaus Brender failed to extend for a further five years, on the board.
Only seven languages for Brender, seven members voted against him. Brenders defeat was a bitter defeat for Sch�Chter, a Erwartbare however.
Because the union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not in office to confirm.
had organized the resistance to the Editor-in-chief of the Hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, Brender had the news of the ZDF lost an audience, he rejected a further term of the highly regarded chef journalist.
until it was on the eve of the election protests, in which the political influence has been plaguing the ZDF.
Finally, even 35 state rights had interfered in the debate, the chefs of the procedure as unconstitutional. found
Nothing came of it.
The person.
Peter Frey was born in 1957 in Bingen on 4 August.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
Afterward, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.

Brenders advance, successor to Peter Frey had recommended that the board of directors with a bold move, by the body immediately after the Brender-much criticized for stepping down.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence it was both Sch�Chter without loss of face for the post of the chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a party into office to lever.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is already included the liberal left-wing.
studies will be Entr�Mpelt
part of the success of the students: After a year of education strike drew the culture of the countries on Thursday at a university conference, a meeting with culture minister and both sides agreed to improve conditions in the study bachelor and masters.
The students should be able in the future, will be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed to in principle, to reduce the burden: each study module is only with a single test.
In addition to the workload of the students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level".
policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for bachelor and Masters to make more flexible.
different countries rules, it should also not be.
fewer tests.
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture minister and Uni-rectors the saying of the better studier eating in the mouth.
Now for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council, decided to drastically reduce the number of tests in part: "Each module, usually with only a test," it says in a 30-page paper, the approval of some new courses.
With the "significant reduction of the last review," said the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, should be a stop to "trend, the studier eating significantly disrupted."
In addition, the "studier eating" the determining factor "in shaping the future".

events "would be avoided.
The students were "entitled to maintain margins, the initiative will enable and promote".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies.
This must be "Reakkreditiert" every five years -- which means that it takes until all the courses have been reviewed by 2015.
are responsible for ten at national accreditation agencies, the Accreditation Council, created by the countries.
The culture minister, had urged the countries "with vigor" in October to influence the agencies, so that the material wealth is not too big and not too strict testing regime.
In various federal ministries of countries, universities and colleges in the country have already agreed to the measures.
So far as the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate said additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The money is the high schools, especially Tutoren programme set up offices abroad and study advice and review and strengthen.
Land and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, will the government a revision of the higher education law to Parliament.
This is the conclusion of a study model be needed only one more test.
The study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of performance is expected to prove to other universities and the easier access to the master.
By the end of next year to study everything the country on their studier eating will be reviewed.
Government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, but there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of Juso-higher education groups called for the design of future policy should not more "behind closed doors" of the prime minister and university vice-chancellors.
After the latest education strikes should now also affected the students as "a say".
The future academic support received by the president of the university rectors' Conference (Hrk), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday during a meeting with the ministers of education, with which the Hrk on a joint paper. Reform
The trade union education and science (Gew), the Bonn process as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal entitlement, every graduate with a bachelor degree access to a further Masters course allows.
The other countries need to make sure that the current generation of the bachelor-study students sufficiently master studying tomorrow with the best possible conditions available, so Gew board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
To a freer access to the master, but not the culture minister.
more than a footnote to Herta M�ller
In Germany, and the deal is good almost no control ... "is the first line of a Gedichts of Lyrikers Werner S�Llner, spoke in the troubling issue snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, won the freedom, but at the same time has lost its language.
The 1951 in Romania's Banat born Werner S�Llner had first as a German and English teachers in Bucharest and, later, Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main �Bersiedelte.
He is S�Llner with various literary prizes. in 1993, the legendary Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen literature in the Mousonturm forum in Frankfurt.
For major literary sensation, he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, in the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and caricature mirror their Securitate files".
clearly unsettled and move S�Llner read out a statement in which he, in Romania German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Mr women Dorfer, his participation in the secret service for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of the present had S�Llner the German language prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, S�Llner, "also someone who has campaigned against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Werner S�Llner is the Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the Nobel honor for Herta M�ller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule is the literary scene and the community, in particular the German authors from Romania, shaken by a fall, the yawning abyss and identify the despicable actions of a political system that based on monitoring and spying.
Werner S�Llner is, so far, you can say, after Bisherigem not only, but also victims.
In its Securitate-acts have played a role in the Walter, said after the confession S�Llners literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the Walter for him.
He had it in for him all at sensitive points' a fool's game, "Markel.
It is a moral need him to make this point.
S�Llners declaration was unexpected in the form and in this audience, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service, however, do not.
Germany has been a cozy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta M�ller had already written in the time in July, after they had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The affected, so we must presume, be speculation and in some case may also have known, the name is clear what lay behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter was.
Unlike in the procedure safe sighting of the Stasi files is now dealing with the legacy of the Securitate-monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in the last few years, and has been hampered.
The Birthler agency, National Council for reappraisal of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, until the publication of the files, but since then has been more slowly.
Only since 2005, there has been a law, the management of the files.
Members of the influence of former Securitate-documented in Romania is still very high, after the announcement of the prize for an interview, in which a former Securitate Herta M�ller, head of Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, after all, it only once interrogated.
The scandal of the power he is able to speak quite openly in the shape of the freedom of expression.
Certainly include the case S�Llner, as is so often the case in connection with sneak blame, inevitable questions.
Why only now? who was hurt? the measured response of listening to on S�Llners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by guilt and shame.
The Genese of Herta M�ller, who has received the Nobel prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
saturation of another Champions League.
It felt as if there is a smart Gekleideter Aussendienstler of a very happy Christmas to a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian gross in the company of an orange plastic bag Ausr�Sters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a finding on C-class rose.
The man with the enormous frozen due to the tourist city of Chauffieren him.
Otherwise, he would also be able to drive itself-alcohol was not in the game, after all, and where good luck was open before the 55 -year-old as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is going to do the work.
Or just right.
In the words of the Swiss committed only three days earlier: "We have achieved the 8", namely the 3:1-success in the Champions League against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be fooled by the success: it will be a brutal battle against the decline."
The "much more important task", on Sunday before.
Then there is, in Mainz the King-class performance in the league-to repeat daily.
And the once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Tr�Sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
lots.
The 8 (out of the Champions League games/re-. + 23-24 February 16-17 9-10. +. March 16-17) will be on 18 December in Nyon scrutineers.
The joy on the Fulminanten a stand of Babbel-successor was also conduct.
not only the supposed saviors, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short space of time, self-confidence, commitment and pleasure.
I am engaged with the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and encouraged them to be brave souls plumber said gross so simple-sounding recipe for success, in the Therapeut Babbel had but had no more effect.
He has a certain magic, was pro-Babbel Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, the man would not have thought possible."
and Sami Khedira, after weeks of violation break his momentum to the best players tried to place wake, "observed the phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the work of the new bosses to describe: "He is a man of action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Babbel had it obviously lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart was still not out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt board
But above all, the VfB Stuttgart needs stability.
How big is not as players and managers, the victory against a weakened and substitute completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests exaggerate.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen came in the wake 0:4, Khedira to concerns.
and sport Horst Heldt board warned that objective has been achieved in a season, but the other is still far off.
We are not out of the woods.
Heldt in his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months was not celebrating, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews broadcast directly before the game start of gate Jens Lehmann fresh lived on.
There are decisions, the other meetings and not the Jens, Heldt responded harsh criticism, the Lehmanns.
The leadership shown weakness of the board and had to change the coach to pressure Pubertierender fans have decided.
Also to be free day after play had been withdrawn, valued Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "characterized by pure self-interest," Keilte Heldt and consequences for the final man announced.
They will be no more friends for life, the two forty years.
But at least they were with all other agree that without the work by the Abgel�Ste coach the team play and vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants "have a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann voices-and also voted for the man with the plastic bag.
World Cup-fight in the heavyweight
hitziges duel in Bern: always provoked challenger Kevin Johnson, the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy weight-title after version of the WBC.

The 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, of the duel had announced the end of the Klitschko-era, but always eluded the blows of the world, so that Klitschko its dangerous rights could not get into the crucial goal.
In fact the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and tried only on the round.
He provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, met its blows the world champions but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second boxer after Timothy Hoffman in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance from 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some turmoil.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly" zombie "is not right".

After almost four years of time he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, "and his" WBC-belt, the campaign had made it before.
In that year he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola in the United States in September.
In this fight, I have only a single bite and I am physically very well in form, Klitschko had the rapid return to the ring.
But his dream is the unification of all four major title in the family.

fall Kunduz
frontal attack from the opposition: green group leader, J�rgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair, described as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left for clarification of the Chancellor.
Hamburg-Berlin-according to the latest findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister, the deadly bombing of two tank last September trains "knowingly lie," said Green group leader, J�rgen Trittin said on Saturday in the Ard-news program "news".
It is called the widely: he lied.
The orders to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf) have been granted.
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that in the attack not only to the destruction of the vices, abducted, but also two Taliban leaders targeted to kill.
In the Kunduz German commander, Colonel Klein requested US-NATO air strikes, the investigation report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag to speak and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether Chancellor, armed forces and intelligence services have adopted this new strategy, called J�rgen Trittin and green-Renate K�Nast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not influence specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were doubts about the presentation of the ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan, and Secretary of State Peter Wichert according to become.
According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank trucks-attack.
Officially, it said, it had denied the existence of the NATO reports and sensitive details of the prime minister denied.

He had not yet received a reply, it says.
The ministry said that on Saturday not to the allegations and pointed out that this will be resolved in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, wants to be formed next Wednesday.
dream worlds.
Some see in Wachem state pictures and hear voices, the others do not see or hear.
not only in the mentally ill and drug binge blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it happened in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we must whatever the wildest ideas and imagination entities.
However, those who experienced in the wake up his dream job conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicted, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices are not only in the mentally ill or in narcotic drugs.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, images to paint or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the borders between dream, fantasy and reality become blurred.
dream alive modified awareness of conditions can occur in a wide variety of forms, in the best case we call it vision, in the worst case madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the vision of the mystical Erin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the new-age-prophet Carlos Castaneda, Schamanische Entr�Ckung conditions, psychosis, hallucinations and similar processes.
hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural offered the brain-especially Dopamin, noradrenaline and serotonin and Acetylcholin-track and share the interaction of various brain is disrupted.
complex hallucinations and Wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic mentality.
The force of gravity no longer has power over him.
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of the dream in the eye condition, William Gries Inger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of the wrong one with a dream situation", the dream of Sigmund Freud was "a psychosis, even with all the inconsistencies, Madness, created false such a".
It is autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a powder.
His body is two dimensional and Quietschbunt.
The force of gravity no longer has power over him, he is hanging in the room.
He senses a kick.
Behind him produce more vicious with blood red, distorted Fratzen, Z�Hnefletschend.
They were hunting him, him with serious inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
noisy, malicious vote roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear, the vote, the insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulling two cable from the stereo, Knotet you to a noose and attached it to a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and is tightening the noose around the neck.
jumps.
The noose is unraveling.
This should be a lesson to you, shouting the vote in Trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years, is the first in almost 20 years.
It was caused by LSD.
his diagnosis is Schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi-depressed, he takes drugs, against the Depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease for three years, he is married.
In the fears I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
about one per cent of the population affected at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia in psychiatric hospitals, it is treated as the second most common cancer after the Depression.
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic affected most can no longer distinguish between domestic and foreign world, they get trapped in an over-heated, the condition can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
This is particularly widespread vote-vote, the orders, or Dialog ize.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The question is no longer important to separate the trivial, the brain can no longer disturbing signals from filters, the awareness of impressions will be flooded.
As the dream the psychosis also opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, emerging from the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the psychosis is subject centered, says Professor Thomas Fox, chief doctor of the clinic for General Psychiatry in university Klinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the storm, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as in a dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and you can not actively make.
schizophrenic so often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Wearing a matching reality is usually not possible, the images are excluded from cruel reality, wake up.
Even in the life of a hallucinatory to experience.
Unlike in the dream, "says Fox, but remains the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the Verfremdung of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why is our brain antics, is still puzzle researchers.
exceptional conditions can lead to everyone that he loses the reality in the short term, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the gene are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers assume that affected with minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal maturing in an early stage of development, will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox said.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system comes first, and not Manifestiere over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role-stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is the disposition.
hallucinogens drugs can also trigger psychosis, because they intervene in the transmitter system.
If our brain is overheating.
This is crazy, Psychotiker suffer from hallucinations and swallow their expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are, in order to get money for drugs, says the L�Becker psychology professor Erich caste.
Whether contributed images will be as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Kasten collects reports of hallucinations and helped phenomena for ten years, in the last year he has his results in the book "The unreal world in our head. evaluated"
hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of surprising many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and skull or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, hallucinations under certain conditions, the brain healthy people.
hallucinations, so Kasten content, from memory, which normally be held back.
They are, if areas, in which sensory processing, are actively discouraged or too little; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also sensory deprivation, stress, like pain or other mental conditions. exemption
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in their lives to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, you live in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and visited the school there.
A normal girl, really.
If not the images and voices would be.
In the break, it can happen that a Schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he says, look at the classmates it surprised-nobody else sees or hears this young.
They believe the timid girls for a Versponnene day Tr�Umerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, you know.
It is, they hear and see these young girls, just as it has in the bank in addition to hear and see.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
It is a nice feeling, it may be the young.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But you know that this young and the other images are not real, and disappear again.
At night, the most frightening phenomena
The images, are often also a burden.
If you are sitting in the schoolroom, you can follow the teaching material, sometimes not, because the teachers in their eyes and ears are presenting a new classmates, although for all other hearing-and visible on the table mathematical equations explained.
At night, the most frightening phenomena.
If they are in the dark room waiting for the sleep, far too little and far too late, they often cannot distinguish whether they awake is already dreaming of, or whether the pictures you can see, the Fratzen or average girls with the bleeding wounds to the arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in, they make the rest.
parents and friends told them nothing, would you consider to be crazy.
autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
In the last year she has insisted the Baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations. stopped
Since the Internet has made contact with the psychologists caste, you know that it is not crazy.
obsession is also a work of art from Despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffered sensory deprivation, in all probability he has hallucinations Kasten says that after a while.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an individual child, as a little girl, fear of other children, they often played alone.
their hallucinations started, with 13 when they learned that the man they called Daddy since they can think, is not your Leiblicher father.
As visual and audio hallucinations in the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is also affected, such as Sarah K. hard to distinguish, images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
hallucinations are also can give images to the brain, that is why they so real. "
night dream images also sees caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy is not radically different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to the schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unlikely to see.
Kasten advises his patients, therefore the hallucinations as a special ability to enhance.
border state between the dream and hallucinations.
In our experience too much awareness centered world, "unfortunately most Pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt-Degen hard, professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy in Heidelberg, a doctor and head of the clinic of Florence Nightingale-hospital in D�sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it is also positive, creative madness-is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degen hard has been exploring the so-called Oneiroide experience form, a particular form of the dream once modified awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the Erlebende for real, and it cannot distinguish the wakefulness in retrospect.
The Oneiroide awareness state created in trauma or illness in extreme situations, for example, Polyradikulitis-patients, in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person is threatened by loss of itself-and the world-for instance, by continuing to complete impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality through a fantasy world, which is removed from the reality, says Schmidt-Degen hard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Because the deal with a situation in the reality of the situation is not possible, a global change is taking place, but the real situation in the imagination. any
An intensive form the foundation of the meaning and significance in a precarious situation, the people making their own ability to us, not in a submerged no awareness of the loss.
Everything is real, and later in the memory
Also the Z�rcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old, and his awareness for a heart valve operation, followed by a heart transplant on travel, while his body for several days in the intensive care unit of the quo is doomed.
Claussen, visited a in a self-created world, other times and places: he is seen as a Bettl�Gerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums robots, a watch on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, dignitaries, the drugs from blood.
The Greeks in the motorcycle trafficked into the country, surfing with his hospital bed in the firn snow in the Alps and is a Korean mafioso.
He is entirely in the imagined happened, everything is real, and later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen is fundamentally different from any dream.
dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.

The holding is also to 100 per cent of the family in the future.
Hamburg-the publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children, heirs with 27 years and have the determination to enter the companies, the 69 -year-old told the Mirror.
The details of this have we as a precaution.
The question of whether they are actively involved in the company, then.
Also, the question of whether they are in a position to do so.
We can not 7500 staff his children swallow, if they are not sufficiently competent.
This brings the children, and the company also.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from the board chair from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
The 52 -year-old Kallen has been a board member since 1999 in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury the responsibility for the assets and businesses after the departure of Mr Todenh�Fer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.

He had "never world power of dreams", so Burda.
I am not as the political Pr�Zeptor this country, as it Springer was, and I do not want to play in league with ' time ' with the entire world, these shops are too great.
The promises of FON peek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only be read his e-mails, without a possibility, to be able to see certain annexes or surfing the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
To see it on the road, which is unlikely, but the idea is still of interest, especially for young people.
In contrast to the smart phones cost very little peek and has a very good flat rate, for example, only half of the price of a flat rate of the iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of that, it has launched two new products on the market, one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which they must pay a price six times higher.
FON peek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore their third version.
It has the same limits, as his American counterpart, however, has come as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance costs for the phone, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone, already know what it means to be away from all the data in order to be able to read his e-mails, as soon as the land border crossing, or if you are desperately seeking a caf� with WiFi (or a link with FON).
The idea of the roaming with flat-rate is incredibly tempting and should really be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, it is already a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses, in order to be able to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe were almost always ignored.
outside of their own country, we always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That is a small device as FON peek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of FON, although it has no WiFi/WLAN) is offering this kind of prices, means that the telephone providers must start thinking, and slowly but surely, to consider various options, as they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices is the downloading of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is a capable of Internet equipment and pay for only a single time, namely the purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what it is, I was also a day of FON peek, expect a buying opportunity with life-long Internet access as it offers a peek in the United States.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be an appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to have a computer with the same system to be able to see.
The fetish color of Michelle
Gelb is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the American first lady.
At the time of the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States they appeared in a dress and a veil of the color and has the same color, re-elected him in his order, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life to accompany: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same color-a bright yellow-green, was the clothes from three parts and coat-dress, jacket from the same substance, and it has contributed a great shaped Gesticktes or a neck.
It even goes so far as that at first sight, it seems that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess in Asturias, and had decided to wear the same dress in more than just a cause.
But the two are different clothes but very much in art, the material from which they are made.
At the inauguration was a dress from head and one from Gemusterten office in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time green footwear with half-high paragraphs and the second time in a �Nhliches model, but gold colors.
The hair was different: every time the hair were on this occasion as a hair wreath bore the previous high, they open the hair.
75% of working mothers because their maternity, problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC study carried out in collaboration with the Institute for Women "fertility and women's career in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years, no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labor market because of their restricted motherhood.
The study makes clear that there are major differences in the decision to start a family, and the number of children there, depending on whether or not the women work and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who do not carry out other activities outside of the house, only part-time work or have a fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job will have their first child together, on average, only 3.7 years after the draw, a number which increased to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this, and learn together and have achieved the first child until much later.
Furthermore, the type of work has a major influence on the motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in the conception willingness, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of the women in the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey, the average age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women the same age.
For example, the women in the group, aged between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main school or a higher education have, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 mother for the first time.
There is also, depending on their level of education, a further difference between the women.
While the women with their final conclusion before its first permanent marry and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school is the other way around and find only a permanent and marry later and have their first child, then, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth

cowardly aggression.
My 70 -year-old mother was walking through our district in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, when, suddenly, a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years in addition to their and our dog were her, our dog is a Mischling, we have taken from the skin and the weighing just six kilos, walking into and then out of the blue missed it two and injured him so difficult.
It is not our outrage in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, where since the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and defenseless animals should be, of course, was carried out on the leash.
Added to that is the choking San fall weather, a woman who was walking, was, as they wanted to confront these people as a result of the incident, they even feared for her own life, because if a dog attack, it will be the same as a kind, perhaps with a woman, a child and an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet city quarter at five o'clock in the afternoon in an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has rung for the whole day.
Of course we have in a close, Police Department reported, but we have serious doubts as to whether this is something and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that only the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
our outrage over what has happened has led us to this incident.
We will not be able to understand what must be in the minds of these young people that you find a cheap fun attack on a defenseless animal, an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among the younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies announcement today.
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this is part of their commitment to the road safety campaign, the "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with every day that passes, the always be safe" and confirmed that they also help educational and informative character with other actions, this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which under the slogan ' to be or not to be ' is, in a first phase will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread.
At the end of Michelin, stressed that the transport security "is a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason, as they are producers of tyres for two-R�Dige vehicles are obliged to see that must be one of the main objectives of the development of an increasingly safer products.
The sale of small trucks rising again something
After almost two years of starting the auto market for small finally see some light at the end of a dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6 %In relating to the year 2008, and, what is more important, they are the first ever increase constantly after 22 successive months of decline, according to the manufacturers' association ANFAC, the car dealers' Association Ganvam presented figures.
These are good numbers, but at the moment to enjoy only with great caution, as the used to compare reference data in November 2008, which is a particularly bad ver Kaus year war with a 60 per cent decline on the previous year.
However, we must bear in mind that, apart from the rise in the last month, the overall admissions this 11 months still 40 per cent below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure, all vehicles, from which the small market is, include: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small, small vans and light vans/chassis.
It is still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most in demand with passion, because even if some of the vehicles will be bought by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized businesses, in which almost 100 per cent of all cases the purchase by a third-party financing.
So we have to these restrictions, which are the result of to tap the credit institutions, still include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate and the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little help.
This plan, however, is intended not only to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if you are a small truck up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, it must not exceed 160 grams per mileage, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded once again that it is absolutely necessary part of the state, including a special attention on this-and, of course, to the industrial vehicles (heavy goods vehicles and buses).
The auto dealers association predicts a similar for the 2010 year just as the last, for the loss of it with a sale (in passenger cars and SUVs) of 19 per cent.
The support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now duty
At the time, as was the case with the anti-lock braking system) and how it happens now with the ESP stability control systems, the aid must be a duty on the brakes in emergency funding in the European cars.
In fact, they are already approved duty on all new cars and light trucks, a period of leave for the remaining vehicles was set by the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union, with the aim to improve the safety of pedestrians, but can also help the braking systems, because of their work, a lot of driving to prevent accidents.
The task of the emergency brake assist system is, more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver on the basis of the system, carried out by drivers braking power on the Bremspedal recognizes.
However, this system is not the pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch-vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision, is no longer on the Bremspedal and half of them had not with full force slowed down.
up to 1,100 branch accidents.
On the other hand, brake assistance, with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the time the brake and therefore also the braking distance, the back of a car in the braking process.
According to a study by the EU could each year to 1.100 fatal accidents, where pedestrians to harm is to be avoided, if all the cars are equipped with this type of emergency brake assist system.
It would be even less accidents-it is estimated that one in every four accident involving personal injury could be prevented, as soon as the so-called intelligent brake systems will be popular.
Then the car is equipped with a system that recognizes the obstacles (on radar or a camera) and warns the driver, and at the same time, there is a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, help him in the system, to increase the pressure on the Bremspedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver did not respond to the warning and even if the clash is inevitable, the braking is assistant to the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General Motors is postponing the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas, Zaragoza) already by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week will start, probably on April 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to point out that he needs more time to finish to the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first the workers and then there are the governments of the countries in which it works, and will postpone until the beginning of 2010.
The meeting will be assured by GM that it in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturers, so this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to, with a number of potential new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports, has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is becoming more and more popular.
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC.
The decision to close at the end of the year, Saab, if it has not been sold by then, will also continue to maintain.
at the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
for the development of its latest and very expensive jewel the engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier for 80 kilos, which he now only 1.275 kilo on the scales.
In order to create something, they would first automatic Aufklappbare on the roof of a tent, the screen roof was replaced with Manuellem driving, so that alone has saved 21 kilo; thanks to this model used aluminum doors as the GT3 "disappearance" a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; it was also the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters to save another 7 kg; through the installation of sporting Bacquet-are still 12 and 19-with the light duty-wheels once again saved five.
It was also through the renunciation of the audio-CDR system-30 six kilos less and again through the exchange of door handles, handles the lack of substance kilo.
Although he is also available with the Doppelkupplung wheels PDK, the test was carried out with a used car with 6-hand machine, mainly on the small country roads of California, on mountain routes, the very Kurvig.
In his driving behavior, it can only be the note perfect.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the road.
It is, in fact, the opposite is the case: for long, we no longer have such a small and easy test, which is a model but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small, athlete, able to flex its muscles in a low gang in the time needed to make warm, until we give him the orders, to pitch to slow down, to recover and then again to get everything out of his motor ...
It makes everything he says. the car makes everything, what we do with our hands on the steering wheel indicates that, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes.
The sound of the V6 boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and we can increase it with the ' sport ' option, as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which already have the Panamera was used for the first time.
The ability to speed up is unthinkable, whether from the brutal, or the speed up again.
The Federungen are stark, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads, where we are with the Boxster Spyder, was pretty damaged, but the car Meisterte the bumps.
The electronic assistants on the whole route had almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice in the gray and roll Splitt tomorrow morning.
To sum up, we can say that it is an ultra-easy car, a car, with the man has an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it is rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and 70.831 euro costs.

The Baskonia itself to a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and so in the first place in its group after the great performances of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple was the best of his team in the assessment (29).
The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov replaced by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end to its victory.
The great hit from the perimeter with 16 rated triple contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue red, from the very beginning to show at the top of the table.
Since the team's first four baskets from Vitoria already came out from the perimeter, we have already imagined that they have come on to the pitch with good reheated Handgelenken.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was no different, except that the team from �Lava for a home side of Barac and decided for the game by Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, the home is, in order to extend their advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic began, as the best of his team with 13 points, including Wennn assessment of the "minus six" cluster could have imagined that it would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game was, despite the clear advantage in the recess still not decided and the Makkab�Er wanted to remind the Vitorianer once again that not everyone on the pitch, and you keep attacking the "hand of El�as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the "yellow" the helm Umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages.
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than a dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get air again and in one of them, suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that advertisements on the table again a reassuring distance was notified by (54-67), the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) were nicer.
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75), have already announced that they would not allow them the victory, which they honestly deserved in the first 30 minutes, taking back.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, tried not to the best of their team, and their team by three points from the line (70-77) to give Kraft.
Nevertheless, and despite splitter because fouls was put in place, the team of Ivanovic, not defended well and although the Israelis in the last minute to repeated (80-85), the game was already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
injuries prevented that has stood up to Unicaja
Unicaja lost vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and had to surrender the lead in Group B of the Euro League in it, and that in a game, the result of the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (free country, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game, was labeled as the Greeks, the easy victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of the peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the most of Europe and has a lot of money.
You offered their game in the first quarter had the Andalusians start to dream. an aggresive defense and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Ereins uni Caja, even if the local team with a home game, between Bourousis Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed, indicate that the plaque in the 13-minute 22-20 in their favor Anzeigte, almost to the minute in the action as a result of a brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams would come and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began at last to be warm and its superiority to game of two halves, while the departure of the Englishman Joel free country because of injury and even the three errors caused by Carlos Jim�nez mark the Unicaja left behind.
Under their players in the field and the Lithuanian before Linas Kleizas, with his three times, increased their advantage in the 19th minute, 44-32.
A race was impossible.
The third quarter marked by many attacks against the team from Olympiacos game, despite its 19 losses consider it and even showed that the difference in Malaga played game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn undermined the leadership of the group.
Unicaja tried to focus on the many failures and the departure of the injured Scots Robert Archibald in the course of the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three of Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66-57.
However, it was impossible because of the Olympia Cos, as soon as he showed aggression and his superiority with centimeters in the basket area, was not to put the brakes on.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37-minute, the difference to rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to surrender the leadership Anolympiacos.

Thank you very much!
The glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood of the markets, is returned the uncertainty in the markets, which in any case is surprising, because this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker on an inherently uncertain future decisions.
The measure, it was used to stabilize the markets, the debt free with the purchase of assets to pay directly and indirectly to the liquidity to hand on interest rates, the move to zero in this way, so that the banks buy assets to pay.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, such as the BCE N�C before, with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
That is why the investors have their doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Fl�Chtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in the corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para-normal amounts, they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and increase the state debt again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of the investors, which in turn increase the differences between the countries of the Eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain until now has been little affected by this episode of instability, but then, Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision in the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, does not harm a degree of uncertainty for the defenders of the moral risk had tried to silence that, once again, to the leaders of the world's economic policy, an awareness of what had caused it to produce, since the devastating effects, which led to the loss of jobs, the restriction of credit had slowed down when they should actually have to decide on a new day of action.
Nevertheless, what is happening in Dubai, in a tribal war between the EMI Ren, in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously predicted.
A government debt, which the state fails, elections and a new government, the same hymn sheet.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Jos� S�crates, Portugal after Mr Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin save Hungary from non-fulfillment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and is therefore a euro-member country, no longer meet its obligations.
It is logical that Ecofin, the Greek government has been forced to be transparent and its citizens in need of Aussergew�Hnlicchen measures with the duty to take, in order to maintain the stability of the state funds.
Yes, we are in an episode of normalization of risk premiums as expected, after some of the excess to large sums of money, and it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of the state debt with the same speed as the European companies increase bonuses.
However, should reduce the differences between European and Spanish Dannn would continue to increase, it is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. during the early indicators here a large part of the market research institute, forcing their scenarios for the recovery and preferable scenario for 2011 to be revised upwards, including the Ocde and the European Commission to come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, despite all the warnings promises no long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy all the Spanish stock, although at the moment is "caution" as they drive.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio S�nchez Gal�n, first met yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where, in those days the strategy in the Spanish energy supply in the next two decades will be debated.
After his appearance, the chairman of natural-gas Fenosa, Rafael Villa ECA followed Gal�n, were some of the key points of the press about what he had submitted to the subcommittee Versschlossenen behind doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround invest 60 billion more from this date by 2030, by ensuring that the current nuclear power stations, continue to remain in operation.
This should not be the case, the investment needed not to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
By 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
The proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with equipment to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on the renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 megawatts, more will be needed under the will depend, of course, by other "support energy".
Gal�n, is of the opinion that the Gese patents success for a sustainable economy, which has been adopted by the government, is in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say something about this in any case law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which is the exact opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, ", it is clear in this direction in the long term, despite some" various measures ", as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Gal�n, believes that we now have the decisions to the investment, even if these are long term, should make, because it will take some time and a stable salary framework must be created, in order to tackle them.
