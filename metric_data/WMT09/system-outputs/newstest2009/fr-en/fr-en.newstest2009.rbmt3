At the end of exchanges, the grant of Prague toppled over to the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the grant of Prague r�ctifia its losses. 
Transactions with actions? EZ attains almost the half of habitual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, from the beginning exchanges, the grant of Prague went back to its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six for one hundred. 
This time, fall is owed to the fall of actions in Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market facing result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the American financial area, is so observable also at our place. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
The Asiatic grants lived a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if indications succeeded, in the course of the day, to erase a party of losses. 
The indication Hang Seng of the grant of Hong Kong lost four for one hundred during exchanges, but later, it erased a party of losses and reduces fall about 2,5 for one hundred. 
The indication Hang Seng China Enterprises according to the movement of the Chinese actions of the grant of Hong Kong lost 3,8 for one hundred, markets being rounded off in Shangha�. 
The actions of the grant of Sydney lost five more than for one hundred, but finally they succeed in reducing losses to 4,3 for one hundred. 
According to its indication, the Stock Market of Taiwan lost 3,6 for one hundred. 
" The hesitancy about the action of rescue in USAS will have an influence on the financial markets of the whole world, " notices Joseph Yam, the leader of the monetary service of Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is to say independently of the Chinese central bank. 
Rates of interest have in Hong Kong the same level as in the United States. 
According to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should quickly restart negotiations and to adopt proposal of supports of the financial system. 
In another way, they would risk that other countries are subjected to impact. 
The blood bath of American actions 
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected plan of support of the financial system, to what it should have dedicated up to 700 billion dollars (12 worry of K?). 
The legislators disavowed so call in support the plan of the president George Bush. 
According to Bush, plan should solve main reasons of financial crisis and to help to stabilize whole economy. 
American actions lived a blood bath, on Monday, and the main indications of actions knew the biggest fall of these last 20 years. 
Indication Dow Jones lost seven for one hundred, having known a fall of such wingspan for the last time in 1987. 
Indication has already lost during vote, but when it appeared that proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress gave in: the government of USAS can inject 700 billion dollars into banks 
The leaders of the American Congress and the government of the president George W. Bush belong agree upon a broader form of the agreement of financial help to the American financial system. 
It will be subjected to vote at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators performed a decisive turn in talks on the adoption of a plan of rescue in the form of a financial help of a 700 billion dollar sum (about 12 billions of crowns), granted in the American financial system. 
Success is not therefore sure. 
In effect, before being able to publish the final version of law and subject it to vote, Congressmans has to end a certain number of details of agreement. 
Plan of supports of the financial system will be examined on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said on Sunday in the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the committee of the banking and financial regulation of the Chamber. 
According to sources, on Wednesdays at the earliest, plan should a priori be subjected to vote in the Senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement due to the fact that the plan of rescue will be adopted should constitute a first major psychological factor to revive financial markets. 
And, being given the complicacy of mechanisms thanks to which the help to markets can be real, will follow a "disenchantment". 
Paulson: Plan must be efficient 
" We accomplished a big progress. 
We regulated our divergent opinions concerning the form which should have the packet of measurements as the stabilization of the market, " entrusted to the Agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to her, final vote could be performed from Sunday. 
During the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, to give a final form in the bottom of the government. 
This one should buy back, to the financial societies, the active unsalable real estate which draw away the financial firms in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety. 
" We are on the point of coming to an agreement on a plan which will work and that must be, also, efficient on the market. 
It is again necessary to follow this plan of re-establishment of markets, but I think that we are there, " said Paulson. 
A sign for Asiatic exchanges 
Worldwide financial crisis has considerable impact on the markets of actions which fall. 
According to the democratic senator get away Harry Reid, the legislators make so that the Congress leads to a final agreement from Sunday. 
They so like to tranquilize the investors before the beginning of exchanges on the Asiatic financial markets, which are located in the first zone per hour, where the decision of the Congress could have an influence on exchanges of Monday. 
And, at the moment, it is impossible to specify with certainty when both Chambers of the American Congress proc�deront in vote, nor if negotiations do not risk remaining blocked, at last instant, by this or that problem. 
The legislators hope that he will be adopted during days to come. 
However, law will still know many modifications. 
Sum intended with the aid of the system must be divided into two parties. 
The first 350 billions of dollars, as wished it the president George Bush, must be available earlier possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that program does not fill its function, it has the possibility of blocking the conferment of remaining sum, following two stages: first 100 billion additional dollars, then, to finish, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr Bush greeted progress in negotiations 
Although the president can put his v�to in this decision, the Congress, shone, has the possibility of putting this one in minority. 
In spite of these modifications, the main idea of program, which consisted in acquiring finances for the redemption of poor property titles, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousand Americans are not capable of paying their mortgages, was supported. 
" All job is done. 
The House of Representatives should be capable of undertaking on Sunday the vote of law, and the Senate on Monday, " pointed out the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
The American president George Bush is happy himself with progress in negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto declared that Mr Bush was happy with the progress performed on Saturday and appreciated " bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy ". 
Limitation of the gold parachutes 
The president of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, chief, said diplomatist that the legislators belong agree upon the responsibility of financial program, protection of the contributing against losses, agreement of tax reliefs, sequence of plan on the axle of time. 
New law also plans to restrict aforementioned parachutes gilded for the managers of societies participating in program and it institutes a committee, which will assure the surveillance of the fund. 
This last should be managed by the Treasury. 
" We worked very hard on question and made important progress towards an agreement which will walk and will be efficient for the market and for all Americans ", declared Paulson. 
Plan also envisages a help for the property owners, with problems to be paid. 
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages which it is going to buy back, while diminishing the monthly instalments of the debtors and by allowing these last to keep their houses. 
Marek: A psychological help 
According to the leader economist of Patria Finance David Marek, offered plan is a good idea, but its realization is going to be very difficult. 
" And it is owed to the fact that they ignore what will be the mechanism and the price of the redemption of assets with problems. 
This point will be decisive to cut on the distribution of losses between the financial area and the government, " said Marek, this week, in the server iHNed.cz. 
If plan will be now adopted, or at the beginning of next week, is not, according to Marek, so important as it. 
" It is much more important that congressmans comes to an agreement, from this week, that they support this plan and that they shall dedicate it earlier possible. 
This psychological signification of the agreement, envisaging the adoption of plan, matters most at present, " underlined Marek. 
A taken to extremes conflict: the readers MP3 against motives. 
They will recommend you, how choose 
While in practice all motives know how to read files MP3, no READER MP3 knows how to phone. 
As seem a result apparently it is better to buy a telephone only. 
All the same there are enough reasons to obtain an independent reader. 
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the home a dear gramophone of top of the range to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On one hand, such musical products do not take out on disc vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, so that it occurs. 
And, if there are stacked up vinyls in your shelving of discs, with art rock, of the jazz or the blues, you dream at least probably about such gramophone. 
The same is true of of music during displacements, to know constricted music, to say it in a simplified manner - about music in MP3. 
There also, there are categories according to price and according quality. 
For the one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, similarly than a fan of the Pink Floyd would find it difficult to support earpieces bought for twenty crowns from the market. 
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough place as everybody. 
The choice is broad. 
The life of batteries is also decisive 
Certain readers of upmarket music are able of many more things than a simple music reading, but it is about unknown functions, naturally, of the most part of the motives there. 
No actual apparatus is also universal as the telephone. 
Next to the first functions, phone calls and the dispatch of SMS, it is able of reading music and films, recording these last, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for instance, to the point of being of use for navigation. 
And if they take into account Smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket. 
Given that no refrigerator knows how to grill some meat and only any television will take photographs, we attend a miracle in practice. 
And, the universal character of the motive is not without difficulty. 
The more the number of functions which you use big, the more the space between two rechargings will see itself reduced. 
And the reading of music is one of the most important goinfres of energy. 
Are rare the motives which are able of reading music during ten-twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is distinctly less than. 
In this respect, the music readers (especially the rudimentariest) are distinctly more competitive. 
In the case of the cheap motives, count that they will play music only during some hours. 
If, on top of that, you sometimes call from time to time, obtain, to be surs, a second recharge for job - this being valid even for the dearer apparatuses. 
Problem will not settle for the readers MP3, who are able, following a recharging, of an uninterrupted functioning of at least 9 hours, including the least competitive. 
Another problem happens during the recording of music in the motive. 
Unfortunately, that a party restricted by apparatuses has an universal connector cable USB, that not all cannot be directly linked to the computer, without a special software package. 
They can, of course, record music directly on the card memory, but few readers of cards know how to be taken without reduction there, being given the tiny dimensions of cards memories used in motives. 
As regards the readers, you need no software package, except exception (iPod). 
It is enough to fill, across the connector cable USB, the music apparatus coming from the computer. 
The most part of the motives and the readers are going to create a library themselves mass media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the judgement of the user. 
Certain apparatuses show only an index having a structure of tree, to Explore it of Windows, others are able of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the clever telephones with surgical system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate, motives have more know-how 
In the choice of a concrete apparatus, be especially interested in the life of the battery, in the capacity of memory, in quality and in the type of exit of sound and, certainly, in the easiness of order. 
If music is for you, principally, a background noise and if during the day you are going to listen that during restricted time, for instance by taking the tram, any motive reading MP3 is enough to you. 
In practice all motives are today able of it. 
You are not even made to pay attention too much to music formats that the motive or the reader is able of reading. 
All succeed in reading MP3 and the great majority of music which is going to reach until you will have precisely this format. 
It is part of most spread formats and apart shone, the great majority of apparatuses succeed in reading also the music of format WMA. 
AAC (format was used by the business company Apple and its iPods), as for him, is less common. 
The upmarket motives also allow the purchase of online music, for instance. 
It is enough to visit, since the mobile phone, the Web pages of the operator (or those of another purveyor) correspondents and to buy the song or the album being discussed. 
This service in himself should constitute a persuasive reason to obtain a musical motive. 
The offer of the operators is unfortunately poor and it limits itself, in most cases, in radio quickly made tubes. 
Prices are not the either lowest. 
However, they consider in general that this way to buy music (whether it is by GSM, Internet, or even by the wireless Internet) will dominate musical industry in future. 
The most part of people always carry their motive on one. 
Each time you want to listen to something, you have only to take out the motive of your pocket, while you forgot your READER MP3 in the home. 
And, it is also important if you always have on you earpieces or handsfree with connection. 
If it is not case, you can use the integrated surrounding walls, which have in practice all motives, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For many, the principal favours musical motives their price is. 
The least dear cost normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand crowns, they can have an already very proper walkman. 
And, in most cases, you will be restricted by the absence of exit for ordinary earpieces. 
The price of the best telephones and the best equipping, endowed also with an entrance for ordinary earpieces, does not exceed fifteen thousand. 
The readers, on the contrary, have advantage to have an easy order. 
Really whoever succeeds in assuring the order of the rudimentariest readers - which do not correspond out of necessity to the least dear (cf. our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the likeness of order with that of a post tape, fluently used in the past, or by a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is not risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected up incidentally, followed by a bill of huge transmission of data. 
Which apparatus to choose 
Even the least dear motives (by eg Vodafone 527) have a slot in general for cards exchangeable memories (M2 type, microSD, and so on). 
Even by taking into account the additional purchase of such card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns. 
But pay attention. 
Basic models support only cards in principle with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the dearest take out with cards memory of 8 GB there even. 
If to have you already a motive and still want buy cheap READER MP3, take a Cowon, an Inventive one, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or an iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must spend no more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you are part of more overdemanding listeners, choose rather specialized motives-walkmen (Sony Ericsson, certain Nokia and Samsung). 
These apparatuses are endowed with independent keys of order for MP3, and that's how the wealth of order gets closer to that of independent READER MP3. 
Sony Ericsson, the motives of series of which walkman have the same user menu as readers MP3 sold separately, is the one who went to this domain furthest. 
The same service, in the same valuable category, but with a memory capacity (until 16 GB) and a life of the battery (normally 15 hours, till 35 hours) superiors, is assured by READER MP3 produced by one of the marks mentioned more high. 
A first virtual operator will earn Tch�quie this year - even. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in Tch�quie is comparatively moved forward, our operators offering in practice the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, we really lack something - a virtual operator, who would force the classical operators to lower prices. 
It is possible that it will not miss for a long time. 
We have already recalled, again and again, on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are part of the dearest in Europe. 
? T � (The Service Czech of Telecommunications), which signalled that the price of SMS was more well brought up at home than in the rest of the Union, besides confirmed it. 
That's how, further to the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the charges of roaming, a paradoxical situation risks occurring - SMS sent since the foreigner will be for certain customers of the operators motive less dear Czech qu ' in the country. 
How is it possible that prices in Tch�quie stay so high, compared with Europe? 
Answer is simple, it is missing that a competition which would really like to enter battle. 
It can seem paradoxical, given that we have three networks all the same motive and a penetration which exceeds 100 % broadly. 
Contrariwise, the operators motive like to complain that the Czech market is extremely compete. 
In this, Pavel Dvo? �k, the head of government of the Czech Service of telecommunications (? T �), who declared again and again that in Tch�quie there had not place anymore as another operator, makes chorus with the operators. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with his own network has obviously more a lot of chance (besides, currently, it would find only hardly frequencies). 
And, there is another possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market which drew away a considerable fall of prices, to that had to, later, react also the classical operators. 
However, before even the entrance of confusion - holidays such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, in similar voices in those that they hear at home today were allowed to hear in Great Britain. 
And, it appeared that there remained the place for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not besides made to go to search too much far to find examples. 
In February we had informed you about launching, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months only, this operator succeeded in earning more than 100 thousand customers and in becoming the fifth operator of the country. 
Let us add that behind Mobilking, there is the financial Penta group, which has U:fon between others in Tch�quie. 
The advantage of the virtual operators being the possibility of concentrating on a much more concrete target group. 
So that their functioning is efficient, they need in effect much fewer customers than a classical operator. 
They are exempt, in effect, from expenses of building, from working and of maintain mobile network, comparatively well brought up. 
That's how in the world, the virtual operators stand out as operators down with expenses - they offer calls and cheap SMS, what is often compensated by a restricted offer of services. 
For instance Tesco Mobile offers SMS, in Great Britain, at least twice less dear than his rivals. 
And, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it, to bet on an unaccustomed target group can also constitute a good blow of advertising. 
In effect, this operator aims in a specific way at the men. 
" The true men choose Mobilking - an operator who pleases them and in whom they can trust, " said David Seibert, CEO of Motive Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such concept would be likely to walk also at our place. 
Miroslav? epick �, the spokesman of Vodafone, in doubt: " The Czech market is comparatively small for a segmental approach, on which are based the most part of the virtual operators. 
Especially since it is comparatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services. " 
In Tch�quie, no chance, say the operators motive 
It seems however almost sure that if there will be a virtual operator in Tch�quie, it will not be Mobilking. 
" We discuss the expansion of this successful plan, but in Tch�quie negotiations are not very promoters. 
The launching of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries of our zone, " said in one maintain telephone for Mobil.cz Jana Studni? kov�, spokeswoman of the financial group Penta. 
She confirmed so indirectly that the operators in Tch�quie were not favourable, anyway, to this idea. 
Contrariwise, they try to do their best so that a potential rival cannot appear. 
The GTS Novera group, which would so like to cross a new step to become a real rival of Telefonika in the field of the customers firm, does not hide its intention, since enough for a long time, to throw a virtual mobile operator. 
" We want a lot to be capable of offering to our customers not only fixed services of telecommunications, but also mobile. 
And earlier will be the best. 
We have already led negotiations about this possibility again and again with mobile all the operators Czech. 
With some, we succeeded in advancing in negotiations, " having said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Future is therefore perhaps promising. 
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps receive the first virtual operator already before the end of the year. 
But at the moment, his creation is accompanied with a complete silence. 
" At the moment, we do not think that there is the place on the Czech market as a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is compared with others very specific. 
For the time being, no subject endowed with a complex and serious plan in this domain contacted us, " mentions Vlastimil Sr? e? of the department of press of Telefonika O2, in the statement for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators also relate to the peculiarity of the Czech market. 
The spokeswoman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrov� asserts in a rare understanding with the statement of O2: " We did not record at the moment viable plan and favourable bilat�ralement, who could act as foundation. " 
And she adds: " It is in practice excluded that a virtual operator appears in network T-Mobile before the end of the year. 
To operate in such a restricted period of time, we should have a concrete agreement from now on. " 
Vodafone aims her attention rather on the accomplishment of requests to acquire his own licence 3G. 
Miroslav? epick � says in comparison with it: " We are opened to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of expenses and facilities shared. 
It is what, according to us, means most provisions from the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this domain being the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a quick mobile Internet. " 
Responsible authorities: in stage with the operators 
The step of the mobile operators is easily comprehensible, the entrance of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall of prices and therefore to a fall of their benefit. 
What's the point therefore to make easier the advent of such rival? 
When it is about their interests, the operators know how to agree as scoundrels in fair. The accompanying chicane the creation of U:fon also testifies it. 
The biggest pressure resembles on? T �, during the creation of U:fon, that been exercised by the society T-Mobile. 
Manifest it information approachable to the public drawn the Web pages of? T �. 
And, today, U:fon takes part serve as argument not to accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrov� pointed out on this subject: " The competition on the mobile market was, besides, newly amplified by the entrance on the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
In view of the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entrance of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, in well brought up requirements. " 
But being given the attitude of the mobile operators that here the indifference of the Czech organisms of regulation seems disconcerting. 
It is not however only about the attitude of? T �, which, contrary to Great Britain and to other developed countries, unfortunately has no power, in Tch�quie, to intervene in economic competition. 
This one belongs exclusively to Service for the protection of economic competition (�OHS). 
And, this last adopted, faced with these problems, the typical position. 
" The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible suite in the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator being discussed concerning the tenancy of necessary facilities. 
No agreement of this type was concluded for the time being, because the offer of the potential persons concerned was not a priori enough interest for the classical operators, " specifies in reply to our question Kristi�n Chalupa of the department of the foreign affairs of the �OHS. 
A statement formulated so would not be surprising on behalf of representatives of the operators. 
But on behalf of a service, which must represent the interests of the consumers and between other one to look after also, in the fact that nobody uses his position on the market, such statement is more than confusing. 
Especially since Kristi�n Chalupa adds: " Abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, they can note that their entrance on the market contributed to a fall of the prices of mobile telephone services. " 
And, to put pressure in the sense of a honest functioning of the market and a fall of prices is not obviously part of interests of the �OHS. 
What is really horrifying, it is the almost touching mobile friendship of the three operators, that follows from their reactions. 
Question, if it is about a chance there really, settles very of course. 
In the same way, a price of the essence strictly identical to all stations of service is surement owed haphazardly and in the hard battle of competition. 
" Service did not release, on this subject, from signs of an anticompetitive behaviour, he therefore has not every reason to intervene in either way. 
None of the operators has predominant position, no has as a result a corresponding responsibility augmented by its behaviour on the market. 
The necessary tools at the opening of the mobile market to the virtual operators miss probably in the regulator of telecommunications even, " specifies in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of predominant position on the market constitutes one of numerous points of dissension. 
Agreed, there is an analysis of the appropriate markets worked out by? T �, according to which telecommunications constitutes the single market, from the point of view of economic competition. 
None of the Czech operators has predominant position on such market. 
However, some experts of right offer another vision of things: so that the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it is necessary to acquire, every time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has the monopoly rather logically on his network. 
That's how he plays necessarily a role prevailing in a certain segment of her activity. 
Golden, even without accepting this argumentation, it should be in least worrying for the �OHS that three mobile operators go about things obviously in a similar way. 
However, the complaints of numerous persons concerned (including the GTS Novera society, already mentioned) show that they confront similar pressures, in negotiations with all operators. 
To make fall again responsibility on? T � a rather common turn in communications is, by means of which the �OHS washes its hands of affair. 
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
They unfortunately didn't succeed in getting in the nov�lisation of law on telecommunications, adopted newly, an enlargement of powers of? T � on the domain of economic competition in telecommunications, although numerous specialists promised an improvement of situation. 
It, the representatives of the �OHS have to very well know it, but their interests are obviously other part. 
When nobody looks, this can walk 
Having said that, functioning of a kind of operators pseudo virtual, several in networks motive Czech, unobserved rest. 
It is about publishing firms their own valuable list of mobile telephone services, but these last are public only partly. 
In most cases, it is a matter of business companies being in charge of the marketing multi-level. 
Been characterized mobile telephone services are so offered for instance by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others. 
The valuable lists of these business companies reach in general elected representatives only. 
The turn of magic consists due to the fact that the firm makes in front of the operator represent of a customer classical firm, which orders a big quantity of cards SIM. 
As important customer, it acquires valuable offer (and others) special. 
What poses problem, it is that the commercial conditions of all operators motive Czech forbids such resale. 
" If there happened what you recall, it could be about a transgression of the contractual conditions which we would examine and that could lead to a stop of the collaboration with the society being discussed, " answers our question relating to this problem Martina Kemrov�. 
However, it is little probable that an echo of such activity does not reach up to the representatives for the operators motive. 
Notably in the case of the three mentioned firms it can be about thousand customers. 
Auncun operator, however, is pronounced against such procedure. 
In effect, the activities of these business companies their bring non-negligible benefits, and, all at once, in contrast with the true virtual operators, they threaten them not at all with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav? epick � points out possible problems: " Law allows such speculations, however, the services of these firms are used only by customers' negligible percentage. 
On top of that, these are forced to suppose that the card SIM in their telephone is not recorded under their name, they cannot therefore have it entirely, like the ordinary customers of the operators motive. " 
And, it is it precisely that should seem strange in? T �. 
Besides, another question in the �OHS settles. 
If the operators motive close eyes on such procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the �OHS has comparatively broad powers to be able to reveal such activity, and if he will not like to content himself with explanation of the operators, which assert having no idea that it would occur, their contractual conditions forbidding it. 
When we shall not be any more the dearest country 
As we have already recalled again and again, the entrance of virtual operators on the mobile market brought a considerable fall of the price of services. 
And, in practice in all countries where appeared virtual operators, the classical operators tried hard, sometimes the more, sometimes the less, to prevent their creation. 
Arguments used by these last were in practice the same - a too small market, or even too much saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
And, it is precisely at this level that intervened, in the developed countries, regulating organisms, which defended the interests of the operators not motive, but those of their customers. 
As well by definite measurements as by an informal pressure, they ended up acquiring the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, Czech regulating organisms treat this question like a hot potato of which they get rid by transmitting it in a close target. 
Further to the experiments which we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in competences is them in these cases more than beneficial. 
But let us not throw the handle after the bashing. 
If the information of wings says plainly and a virtual operator will soon appear at our place, the Czech mobile market will recover perhaps in movement. 
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the �OHS will hardly be able to only remain impassive facing rejection (in discrimination) of other persons concerned. 
And we shall perhaps cease calling more a lot than in the rest of Europe. 
New Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of Czech national hymn. 
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech nationality, the prime minister Mirek Topol�nek introduced solemnly new recording of national hymn Kde domov m? j (Where is my fatherland?). 
Hymn was once again recorded by the orchestra of the national Theatre conducted by Ji? � B? lohl�vek. 
We have four versions - with a masculine or female solo singing, an interpretation with ch? ur and an instrumental version. 
Singing is assured by Kate? ina Kn?? �nkov� and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremi�? and Jaroslav Kr? ek the authors of the arrangements of hymn are. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
B? lohl�vek considers national Czech singing to be one of the nicest hymns. 
How it had already entrusted in before? esk � rozhlas (the Czech public radio), it chose as the interpretation of solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated. 
" Since the beginning, I tried to look after in the fact that both singers, as well as ch? ur, have a good diction, so that they understand words definitely, so that they sing simultaneously, " he specified. 
Czech national hymn will celebrate its 175� birthday, next year. 
Singing Kde domov m? j blares for the first time in 1834 on the boardwalk of Stavovsk� divadlo (the Theatre of states) in Fidlova? ka (F�te of savetiers), Czech original room of Josef Kajet�n Tyl, accompanied with the music of Franti? ek? kroup. 
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated him. 
After the creation of Tch�coslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse became of course left integrant of national hymn. 
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
How rings "new" hymn 
Transport together (MHD) pragois will introduce the flea, on Wednesday, into their system of cash dispenser 
On Wednesday, October 1st, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of Pra? sk � Dopravn � podnik (the Agency pragoise of the transport) as the date to which will go up in the subway, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
At present, this last is approachable for almost hundred thousand persons, owners of the smart card Opencard. 
The passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from January 1st, 2009) and at the same time to make it record on their smart card in the points of information and the offices of Dopravn � podnik (the Agency of transport), located in tube stations Muzeum, M? stek, N�dra? � Hole? ovice, And? l, Roztyly, Let? any, Kobylisy, Rajsk� zahrada, Ka? erov and Luka. 
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons by Internet on the Web pages of Dopravn � podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred persons used service in the course of the morning. 
Those who will begin using the online store can forget counters in a final way in tube stations, where they until now had to trample of impatience in long tails with the intention of acquiring paper tickets. 
In effect, they will buy their coupon by Internet and they will record it on their card Opencard in one of thirteen M? stsk� knihovna (local libraries). 
" In these points contact, there is a counter at the disposition of the passengers with a formed personnel, which will help the persons concerned with the purchase by Internet and, besides, record the coupon which they bought on their card, " having said the spokesman of plan Martin Opatrn �. 
Next to libraries, it will be also possible to record the electronic coupons on Opencard in automatic teller machines installed in the hall of several tube stations. 
What resemble these distributors? 
They are red, remind of machines to stamp tickets and the passengers perhaps already pointed them out in tube stations Roztyly, Bud? jovick�, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk�. 
" Today, the city has five of it, but before the end of the year, there should be eighty of it, " added Opatrn �. 
A robot will control the coupon instead of the driver 
The robots which are going to work as from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the smart card Opencard and the coupon bought before is going to record itself itself on the card. 
The electronic coupons are valid as from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city. 
To know in p�riurbains trains and lines of bus 300 - 499, which use principally the inhabitants of the villages of the central Bohemia to achieve the capital. 
" In trains inserted into Pra? sk� integrovan� doprava (integrated transport of Prague), the inspectors are equipped with readers of cards, with the aid of whom they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons; " explained the ticket inspection Filip Dr�pal of the organization Ropid, which conceives the timetables of transport together pragois. 
P�riurbains buses are equipped with readers of cards inserted into the case of the driver. 
During embarkation it is necessary therefore not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it is also necessary to put Opencard in the place pointed out on the side of the case. 
That's how the driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons. 
" In case the passenger would need to prove the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing simpler that to ask for this information the driver, " supplemented Dr�pal. 
The passengers who do not take p�riurbains buses and will not remember date when expires the validity of their coupon, be able to join automatic teller machines again, initially used to record coupons on the card. 
It is there, on the screen of the apparatus, that is going to be displayed information concerning the validity of their document. 
Sud�tes claimed a referendum in USAS 
The Germans of the Sud�tes asked in 1945 what? umava is inserted in the United States. 
It follows from a letter deposited in the collections of Jiho? esk� v? deck� knihovna (The scientific Library of the Bohemia of the south). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the employers of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Germans of the Sud�tes contacted supposedly the president of USAS with such wish. 
It follows between other one of the letter preserved in one archive deprived, who is deposited in the collections of Jiho today? esk� v? deck� knihovna. 
Germans of? esk � Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to allow that "? umavsk�? upa " (region of forests in the south of the Bohemia) - appended by Hitler by virtue of the agreement of Munich - is returned in Czechoslovakia. 
" We definitely understood situation and really want to be sure that words proclaiming that the American troops come on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators, " am written in the letter, signed " Persons, in whom fate of? umava holds in c? ur ". 
Given that the rallying in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - by knowing Czech national character - only of brutality, attitude without respect, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in the hands the protectorate of? umava for now and forever. 
" We can believe, only you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and that contributed in no way to the win of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter of one million inhabitants, " am written in the letter. 
The reason pretended for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the wish of revenge of the " Czech oppressors ". 
If the president of USAS doubted the opinion of the Germans of? umava, it would have only to organize a referendum, according to the authors of the letter, in the region to establish if his inhabitants wanted to be part of USAS, or to live under the employers of the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter can, considering actual knowledge of the history of postwar period, seem a little na�ve, according to certain survivors, it illustrates well wait of the Germans of the Sud�tes of epoch. 
While the Czech Germans had to foresee at least that the question of their expulsion of the republic will settle, very few of them confesses such possibility. 
Some people waited that the United States and Great Britain were going to acquire a certain type of self-government for Sud�tes. 
Others thought that they would stay simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in? esk� Bud? jovice, confirms it. 
During war, this one was, as German of? esk� Bud? jovice, hired in navy in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu ' at the end of war, it was captured by the Englishmen and put in the camp of capture of the region Holstein, dozens Czech Germans came to consult it so that he teaches them Czech. 
" They thought that once back to them, Czech would be beneficial them ", says Chalupa. 
Any of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before war estimated, according to him, only, further to Decrees Bene? it would be evicted from the republic. 
You do not think - you pay! 
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers 
The action aiming at the costliest road safety in Czech history. 
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that aimed at throwing, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport. 
The service of the minister Ale?? eb �? ek think that she is going to discourage the drivers of a dangerous behaviour in the steering wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 millions will appear to television, to radio, to cinema, on Internet, but also on pamphlets. 
It should discourage the drivers of quick behaviour and alcohol in the steering wheel. 
But also remind them to take the belt before starting. 
She especially wants to touch the conscience of the young drivers, of bikers, of pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in blips? 
Especially personal stories which are going to attack emotions. 
The "bloody" slogan of all campaign also manifests it: 
You do not think - you pay! 
Sentence " You do not think " is inscribed in uppercase letters on the plate of registration. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is sentence " You will pay ". 
What must represent that they can pay life an instant of inattention. 
Blips are going to "haunt " the audience until 2010. 
The ministry drew inspiration from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where they can see pictures commonly with drastic pictures of the victims of accidents. 
He thinks that it will draw away a fall of the rate of accidents and among deaths on the Czech roads. 
Blips were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of the sugar and the whisk against the drivers 
" What walks with the drivers, it is the system of the sugar and the whisk. 
For them, the sugar is represented, for instance, by fact to gain time, when they grill a red light. 
The whisk, it is the threat of a penalty or an accident. 
Risks must be reminded the drivers, " said Martin KB? �n, the psychologist of the transport of the hospital Na Homolce. 
That's how we need campaigns of information in the press and especially negative advertisings, estimates the psychologist. 
Panels signalling danger to the drivers are, according to him, already less efficient. 
" When a static panel which warns against a danger is installed, it is probably quickly going to merge with environment and drivers shall not point it out any more, " signalled KB? �n. 
Olmert would be productive in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, was pronounced in favour of the restitution of in practice all territories occupied in 1967, including therefore West Bank of Jordan, Eastern Jerusalem and height of Golan, in exchange for peace with the Palestine and Syria. 
It made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
" We must lead to an agreement with the Palestinians, what means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, or even all, " said Olmert in the daily. 
" We shall keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we shall have to give up a similar percentage to the Palestinians (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be made, " he added. 
It supposed that possible restitution would consist of Eastern Jerusalem. 
" The one who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want that tractors and bulldozers crush him feet, as it arrived at one of my best friends, will have to abandon parties of Jerusalem, " pointed out Olmert by making allusion to both attacks in the city, in July, during who several persons were killed and dozens hurt persons. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find " a special resolution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places " located inside the Old city. 
" The one who will want to support Israeli sovereignty on all city will be forced to insert 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not walk, " he underlined later. 
Retirement of the height of Golan 
Olmert was also pronounced in favour of the retirement of Israel of the height of Golan, what constitutes a necessary condition, according to him, with the aim of the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
And, it would also require certain efforts on behalf of Damascus. 
" I do not offer to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retirement of Golan, " it signalled. 
" The Syrians know very well what they are going to have to abandon to acquire Golan. 
They are going to have to abandon their actual relations with Iran; they are going to have to abandon their relation with Hezbollah (shiite movement); they are going to have to abandon in supports constant that they grant in the terrorism of Hamas (shiite movement), Al-Ka�da (terrorist network), as well as that of Djihad (holy war) in Iraq, " specified the prime minister. 
Questions which come into sight after accident: Are the flight attendants in the coach illegal? 
Law ignores them; to walk in a coach long distance is forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the society Student Agency near Padoue, in Italy, question comes into sight if the flight attendants and the passengers can during itinerary to move inside the bus. 
" If they wanted to respect law in a strict and definite manner, the activity of a flight attendant is opposite to law on the road traffic, " having said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident being discussed, during which perished a 22-year-old hostess, was obviously caused by the driver of a truck which crossed the way of the bus. 
The girl was at this instant unfortunately sat next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has at his/her disposal two other seats. 
And, the bus can have an accident, or even brake in a brusque manner, also at the time when the flight attendant serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What matters, it is if the bus is by virtue of its technical data sheet equipped with places standing or not. 
If this equipment for places standing is not approved, the passengers have to remain sat. 
Buses long outdistances Student Agency have not places standing; what was confirmed in Aktu�ln? .cz by the manager of the firm Radim Jan? ura. 
" It is a question which we treated with the ministry and, at the beginning, it forbids any displacement of the passengers. 
Then they cancelled it and we acquired that the passengers can go to toilets during itinerary provided that they have their own seat, " it revealed its position. 
Law ignores the flight attendant 
" There is not unequivocal juridical interpretation of the role of flight attendant - no juridical prescript is in charge of this role. 
On the other hand, no juridical prescript forbids either the conveyor to offer services. 
The law on the road transport knows only the term of ticket collector of vehicle; it does not define its rights and its duties, " adds with more of ambig�it� the spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorn �, the manager of the department of the circulation of the road vehicles, respect, contrariwise, that law treats problems enough. 
" Everything depends on fact if the bus has permission in its approval to offer places standing. 
Everything domiciles in here, " he says. 
Buses are divided into urban, where there are places standing and restricted maximum speed, long-distance with places standing and more well brought up allowed speed and in buses long distance without place standing with the most well brought up allowed maximum speed and of seats equipped with seat belts. 
As on the plane, says an expert 
Jaroslav Ho? �n, expert in BESIP (security of the road traffic) in security in transport, does not see the displacement of the flight attendants aboard as a major problem. 
" During a regular circulation, there is not danger. Situation can be compared with that of service in planes. 
There either, it is not sure when will occur a turbulence and the flight attendant can bash the head. " 
" And, in case the bus would have braked in a brusque way, the laws of physics would be of course valid. 
Similarly than in an urban bus or in a tram. 
The conveyor must manage the security of the flight attendants by internal prescripts, " he says and also thinks that from the point of view of law, problems are not regulated. 
Jan? ura am ready to abolish these services 
Student Agency is the only conveyor bus to offer the services of flight attendants. 
It engages two hundred. 
Even after this accident, the manager does not consider their job to be a job at risks. 
" However, as soon as I shall have the impression that it is about a job at risk, I shall abolish it. 
The passengers can accept their coffee and their newspaper in embarkation. 
It would also diminish expenses, " he says. 
The worry of security is the reason which gives to the absence of flight attendants in his vehicles the manager of the Asiana Alexe� Litvine, that assures, compared with HER, a number very reduced by lines. 
" We do not have hostesses. We oppose to it since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will finish by a lethal accident, " he said, there is one years, in T�den.cz. 
A huge tragedy arrived 
A young hostess of the region of Plze? who worked for the society for two years, perished during accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian truck has probably quit� the hard shoulder without using turn signal and it blocked the way in the bus. 
The driver of this last to try to avoid it by means of a man? uvre rushes, but it brushed it by its righthand. 
Jan? ura refuse that both seats reserved for the repose of the flight attendants are sold. 
" In the case of lines long distance, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked. " 
The firm intends to lodge a complaint against the driver of the truck. 
For the indemnification of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgement of the court, but as regards financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit. 
A modification of law? 
Not within sight 
A modification of law, which is being worked out, for more than a year, by a group of thirty experts of the Ministry of Transport, could bring precision as for displacements of the flight attendants on board of the bus. 
" And, it did not lead to any conclusion on this point. 
In actual fact, it is not too much interested in buses, but rather in system of points, in maximum speed on the freeway and in use of the portable in the steering wheel, " having said the expert Ho? �n. 
" The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants a thing which would put basically in danger the security of the passengers, " concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, by adding that the control of the security of buses is under the power of the police and service for security at job. 
The hopes of D�sseldorfois rest on Frankfurt. 
Big words did not miss in the letter addressed by the management committee of WestLB to the employees of the home. 
All over an union of the entities of the financial institute of D�sseldorf with Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, " the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse " could be formed, according to the mail made public on Monday. 
WestLB would bring a " block of competence " double of a lasting productiveness in such affair. 
As a result, such relation could be decisive kickoff towards other concentration in the area of the banks of L�nder. 
Veils what it resembles when a committee board of directors wants to show its capacity of action at difficult time. 
Because WestLB, hurt, is always subjected to a strong pressure. 
It is not only the European Commission, but also the federal Authority of Surveillance of Financial Services that, it only newly, apparently made understand in the government of the Land de Rhenanie du Nord-Westfalie that the time was counted in the research of a future resolution. 
It is nevertheless a matter for some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relation of any form between the bank Deka, which connait the customers of the Sparkasse all over their funds of investments, and WestLB. 
Certainly the leader of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas informed during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he saw no sense in the fusion of the home of Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that it is Helaba or WestLB. 
However the board of directors of Deka, every half of which is supported and by the banks of L�nder and by the groupings of cases of savings, made responsible the management committee for driving talks with WestLB with the aim of common commercial activities. 
It could then be about the debit side of the financial market, or parties of this one. 
Talks have however just begun only, as it is said in the financial place. 
It is not the first time when Deta-Bank, which, with his 3000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers on the financial place of Frankfurt, enters in game lorqu' it am a matter of strengthening of the area of the cases of savings. 
In 2003 they thought for a moment that Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land de Rh�nanie Palatinate and Halbab. 
Nothing however came out again from this bunch ternaire. 
Barely plans had them made public that the government of the Land de Hesse was pronounced against any participation of Hellaba in these. 
Later, the two other houses either not rejoign�rent not. 
The bank of the Land de Rh�nanie Palatinate was attached to the place in the bank of the Land de Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were new negotiations always on the grouping of Deka-Bank with banks of L�nder. 
Lastly, G�nther Merl, president of the management committee of Hellaba, had however been pronounced against any commercial strategy of fusion with his bank. 
Independently of it, feeling seems to spread that the grouping of the different establishments of the public area is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election in the Parliament of Land of Bavaria is crossed, an union of BayernLB with the bank of the Land de Bade-Wuttenberg could become a reality in the very first. 
For Helaba, it is not particularly a good news. 
If the pressure which obliges in new fusion had to augment, the possible partners avoid him little by little. 
In the South, she would be a junior partner consequently, although she has to there better resisted to crisis than banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which has 85 for one hundred capitals of Helaba, drew a bolt on the other hand at the beginning of the year at any union with WestLB. 
Would stay in rigour NordLB. 
Such g�o-strategical cogitation reflect however only one of the facets. 
Another facet asks question to know how the different commercial models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, to know thanks to which commercial model the future capacity of the banks of L�nder should be assured, had not been to there solved by the German grouping of the cases of savings and transfers. 
Eventually, a cutting up of WestLb could take place, cutting up which here is not of course desired. 
It is also of it of that it is a matter in the letter of the committee board of directors in place: in any case, would be purposeful one `solution total ' for the establishment. 
How all that will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank still remain to see. 
Second weekend of the holiday of beer is also known as the weekend of Italians. 
For Elena, it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as girlfriend, and therefore nothing is similar, he says. 
Behind them, near a barrel of five-litres of beer of mark Kaiser, a well built bearded man is held who shows to about 200 visitors of the holiday of beer which deep sounds his gullet can produce. 
Elena types Luca first, can embrace it. 
From Bologna, they came until V�rone. 
From there, of the road railway station near the railway station Puorta nueva, four buses take departure this evening at 23 h 45, `destinazione Monaco, festa birra della ', arrived envisaged at 6 h 30. 
Three buses are reserved first of all for Italians, in one of the buses br�silens exclusively travels. 
In a corner of the parking, the South American sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night. 
And so loud, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians. 
Buses belong to Marco, who carries a long topcoat doubled by wrong fur and by spectacles in the broad silver-plated settings. 
For five years, they go to the holiday of beer, already three transferring nothing this year. 
They go of night there, remain the day on holiday, and come back at 22 h 30. 
To spend the night there would implicate useless expenses, explains Marco. 
Trip costs 75 euro, including the pot of welcome with a beer Kaiser, tossed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, the health insurance and a representative for the German eloquent group - Marco made a lesson of language in Frankfurt. 
And already buses run at night on Autostrada direction `Brennero '. 
There is beer, yet. 
Fast, everything becomes calm in the bus, the passengers sleep. 
It is so better, they will still need their force. 
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a big number of other buses with plates of Italian registrations makes a pause once again a little before Munich, on the freeway 8. 
When in the early hours, the group of Marco arrives finally at thirty past six o'clock as planned on the parking near the place Theresa, about 50 other buses of all Europe are already there. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the plan of attack. 
Firstly: do hair of the small yellow cap. 
Over am written to the left `F�te of some beer ', in Gothic, and near the Internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it ". 
Secondly: `Lorsque the doors of the tent of beer open, they run ', shouts Marco in small morning. 
`Courir! ' Run and reserve places in the bottom of the tent. 
`Pas in front of, otherwise they jam, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, it is necessary to divide them in the room! ' 
The tankard, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euro. 
And do not forget baggage room! 
`Montrer to the agents of security that we act well! 
As soon as you leave your places, they left! ' 
Thirdly: `Ce in the evening, to have come back here has pile ten hours and a half! ' Including? 
And that's it, it left towards the holiday of beer. 
On the way, somebody ties yellow caps in trees to find the way, in panels and even in electoral poster of a big Bavarian popular party. 
They want to be ready for return. 
It is the second weekend of the holiday of beer, known as `week-end of Italians '. 
There are not definite figures; they speak about 50 000 which set off across Alps and collapse in the newsstand with beer, 10 for hundred visitors would be deliberately come by Italy this weekend. 
The police from Munich is reinforced by seven policemen of the Tirol of the South, by rescuers Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian red crucifix which accomplishes a statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British women (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical interventions. 
The one who is particularly appreciated of Italians, it is the tent of the brasserie Hofbr�u. 
At nights of insomnia for the stockholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is comparatively stable, the federal Minister of Finance some weeks ago only insisted. 
Which chance that the politician used word `relativement ' and that he slid that the area German banker would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
This one happened in effect this weekend. 
The financier of Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side in DAX, acquires a credit of a billion from a consortium of German banks to protect himself from turbulence of markets. 
A person in the confidentiality of situation said to Reuters on Monday that help credits are issued up to a 35 billion euro sum. 
The Hypo Real Estate should consequently pay interests on the fraction in which she would so have the right. 
Silver comes so many private banks as banks of public law. 
In the background, it is the Depfa society-girl which supports losses. 
The state financier had, to an article of newspaper, re-financed short-term for long-term plans for which he had borrowed some silver - what is not possible any more due to mistrust towards markets since. 
In the first semester 2008, the reservation of liquid assets of the bank had been reduced by 95 for hundred - 2,37 million euro, the rate of equity capital also had lightly weakened from 1,6 to 1,45 for one hundred. 
The ongoing benefits and those net coming from financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period the previous year, thrown in the zero point, benefits coming from the attribution of credences and from determined securities as well as the termination of supplies in the operations of credit 70 for hundred - 5 million euro had fallen of more than. 
And it is only thanks to the important benefits drawn of the refund of the expenses of accountancy downstream coming from the restructuring of the ancient group Depfa, as well as the refund of interests according to the book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for the firms of Concern that the deficit of winnings about 16 for one hundred proved to be be softened. 
After his privatization in 1990, the ancient state financier had badly speculated first of all about property industrial credits, which then had been filialis�s in the bank Aareal. 
Parce that the financing of classical state was not rather lucrative, Depfa had then got involved more intensely in the plans of facilities and in the financing of plans together between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and manifold internationally. 
On the value of the society-girl, the Hypo Real Estate must undertake redemptions should on counting of winnings and losses of the group with an essential material effect which remains all the same rather blurred. 
Fact is that dividends had amputated. 
Already for 2007, they had been cut down in the two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the redemption of Depfa, an investor of state and facilities highly important. 
It is more solid than of other institutes dependent on re-financing on the interbank market since she has no store of customers. 
With the failure of the bank of investment Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the attribution of credits between banks once again considerably dries up, banks having collected their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs for a party - about 50 Billion euro - all the credits of Depfa of a short term means of re-financing yearly. 
To a press release of the Hypo Real Estate, the need of financing of the group is covered with medium term credit and firm protected from the influence of the financial international markets broadly out of state of step nowadays. 
Other sources say that re-financing would be assured thanks to fund till the end of 2009. 
The president of the committee board of directors of HRE Georg Funke explained on the other hand that the Hypo Real Estate group should not have to any more use the medium term financial markets. 
The federal Bank and the federal Establishment for the Surveillance of Financial Services (Bafin) leave principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is consequently assured. 
The stockholders and the creditors of the bank do not have more than to hope for it. 
However, in view of dynamics and in imponderability of crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not besides unthinkable that you does not have to use the financing in all the expanse. 
But the opposite either cannot be moved aside. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last press releases, still near the insolvency on Sunday at the end of party, this at least interim rescue will not succeed in reassuring minds either. 
The lesson of action collapsed of 75 for hundred - 3,30 euro. 
The lessons of obligations, on the other hand, carry particularly well. 
While debts primarily barely moved, the lessons of the secondary loans sag. 
The most affected are especially the funds of investment of the ancient society-girl W�rttemberg Hypo and those agreed which have a life beyond of 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate before seemed to be an alternative investment of speculation, consequently their value must be considered as dependent of the stability of the system international banker after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute which got crisis into the establishment by the redemption of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the institutes of program, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, they can presume a resorption of arrears in time. 
Or what will arrive for what nobody dares to hope - at present that financial crisis can be overcome in next 15 months. 
But faced with renouvell�s noise of a partial nationalization, the likelihood which approached the suret� has become a simple justifiable hope today. 
It should reserve of insomnia first of all at night for the long-term creditors on the decision to know if they have to part from their commitments. 
The short term investors can always use at what they drew a trait to constitute an adjournment of losses for next years on the next levy on the incomes of the capitals of stock exchange winnings automatically taken. 
Sylvana and secrets of limp her in Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must come for the first day to the Highschool de Tachibana, the girls begin pouffer to laugh: the German is so much "Kawaii"! 
What est-ce-que this wants to tell? 
Sylvana connait already this word thanks to Mangas - in his new Log of exchanges, she speaks about Japan. 
" The first day of lesson in Japan. 
That est-ce-que I was thrilled. 
Already the way to go to school frightened me. 
I live in periphery of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool de Tachibana. 
I have of find the way all alone, happily I did not get lost. 
The beginning of lessons does not seem to be fixed in so strict a manner as at our place in Low - Saxony. 
The pupils appear in turn from eight hours, until at twenty to nine o'clock, a turn of table begins with the professor, the "home room". 
But before lesson begins, it belonged to me to introduce me. 
I am in no way the type to like to speak in front of people, particularly in front of a class of 40 pupils. 
As I still had no uniform of the school, I put an old skirt of my mother of reception, as well as a shirt, of blue socks going up and the black leather footwear. 
In this keeping therefore, I came in front of the control panel, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in week. 
At this instant, I was very happy to have begun learning the language it there two well years. 
The 31 girls of the class all whispered, pouff� of laugh and fact of signs, and I always heard word " Kawaii ". 
I have already known it thanks to my mangas. 
It belongs to the vocabulary necessary to the survival of the Japanese teenagers and means " darling, cabbage ". 
Then I fast slipped on my place. 
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she found that it was a honour that the correspondent has to sit down next to her. 
The rest an hour was rather calm, but when the gong resounded, I was attacked in rules. 
Everybody spoke to whom better better, pouffait to laugh and asked me a lot of questions - in that case, it is rather difficult to understand English Japanese. 
During pause, they all then took out their Bento. 
My mother of reception had also made me this type of Lunchbox - it is really something else than poor snack German. 
I had of the rice in the aromatic herbes, of small sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweeds, of fruits and a kind of meat encircled with Tofu. 
Mostly, I have no idea of what I eat exactly in Japan here. 
Things have a strange appearance and an absolutely new taste. 
What is sure, it is that everything is really good. 
Good, except perhaps the salt confites plums, brrrr! 
Bentos is not only lunches in the Japanese schools. 
It sometimes happens that a girl gives to a boy Bento that she prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to make the acquaintance of the boy a little better during pause. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could notice it so here. 
" Why Japan particularly? " my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to cross one year to the school in Tokyo. 
I then answered always: 
" Because this fascinates me, what " 
When all is said and done, read mangas, it is what I already prefer many years. 
And to understand better mangas and culture which is, there at instant, I also began learning Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel it one day. 
Because I also have a weak-willed person as traditions, us and usages. 
And here, they give them a lot of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technologies and the most recent tendencies - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional. 
And as very am so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city which I have never seen. " 
Rats also have feelings 
A rat or a tattletell runs away in front of danger, est-ce-que this means that he also feels fright? 
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is persuaded there: many animals also have feelings. 
But how could they prove that it feels the same thing when he acts in the same way as we? 
In the online magazine " Edge ", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
ONLINE SPIEGEL introduces in a series of articles of answers to question " That do you think be true without being able to have proof of it? " 
I think that the animals have feelings and other states of conscience without that me or whoever of other one cannot up to now prove it very as they cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in that case, they can hope at least that all human cerebrums introduce the same shape. 
As soon as we turn to other kinds and as soon as we tackle the questions of the feeling or in general conscience, we enter hardly workable fields because the Hardware does not correspond. 
When a rat is in front of a danger, it makes the same thing as many other animals: it makes dying, runs away or breaks. 
The human beings act similarly, that's why certain scientists deduct one from it lived comparable subjective. 
Nevertheless, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the cerebrum return the transposition of our subjective living that of the animals difficult. 
One of the aspects is that circuits linked almost always to human conscience include the prefrontal lateral Cortex (due to its participation in short term memory and in functions of direction and execution). 
This vast region is much more developed at the human being's than at the other primates and entirely seems to be away at other being. 
Everything least therefore for these aspects of our conscience which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among that the conscience of whom we are, and the capacity to envisage and to decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates. 
Another significant feature could domicile in the linguistic nature of the Man: a big party of its existence being linked to the language, it often means that his conscience depends on it. 
In that case, they could exclude the animals. 
But even if conscience did not have to depend on the language, this one would influence it surely, so that animal conscience, whatever is the manner it is produced, would be different probably a lot the most part of our states of conscience. 
It is for it that it is also difficult to determine what can resemble the conscience at other animals. 
If it, internal and subjective, lets itself neither to measure nor, due to this particular Hardware, analyse by blending in on our own experience, then her observation puts us down of big problems. 
The most part of my developments refer to the contents of the aware living, but there is in side another aspect of conscience which should be more easily approachable scientifically. 
They could examine the processes of conscience of the animals without taking into account their contents, and it is exactly what took place during studies on the short term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they concentrate more on nervous correlations of conscience which on causals mechanisms: two can be identical or not. 
Funnily, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization. 
But what does it result from it then for emotions? 
I conclude from it that an emotional system such as that of fright is speeded up in a cerebrum aware of its own activity. 
What we indicate as "fright" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the system of defence located in the cerebrum (or its suites, as the reactions of the body) hoards of the random access memory. 
So noticed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex which characterize primates and particularly the Man. 
From subtle degrees of the feeling, linked to our voluble nature, free, because we can, with the help of words and with grammar, differentiate and cat�goriser states to attribute them to others than to us even. 
In the comparing, Antonio Damasio for instance thinks that feelings coming from primitive activities are born in the regions of the bodily feeling of the Cortex and the cerebral trunk, very as Jaak Pankseep which concentrates nevertheless more on the cerebral trunk. 
As this network did not change in the course of human evolution a lot, he could wholly participated of transverse feelings in any type. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it indemonstrable. 
Pankseep deduces due to the fact that what appears as fright at the Men and at rats is probably felt also as such in both cases: how could they however prove if rats and the Men feel the same thing when they act in a similar manner? 
A tattletell runs away in front of danger, but if he feels fright? 
In my opinion, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical living. 
Certainly, nervous comparison helps: rats and the Men have similar cerebral trunks, the tattletells on the contrary do not have a cerebrum even. 
But est-ce-que the cerebral trunk is at the origin of feelings? 
And even if they could prove it for the Man: how could they show it at rats? 
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even the tattletells (who knows?) have feelings. 
But I would not know how to show it. 
And because their feelings are absolutely different probably from ours (since human conscience rests on special circuits and on the language), I prefer exploring emotional behaviour that the emotional feelings of rats. 
At any rate, progress dawns on nervous plan as much as they sound the same thing to rats and to the Man. 
As I do not explore the language and conscience to rats, nor feelings, I do not know if they exist. 
They could judge it as of the short term, but I prefer moving forward rather than to bash always against a wall. 
I am in effect a pragmatic �motionel. 
Platini, govern of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and the Ukraine 
The taken on prime minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime minister. 
" The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux to be a proof of trust in the Ukraine and in its capacity to organize, in collaboration with Poland, European championships ", announced Wasjunik. 
" But it is not an amnesty for our country. 
Job has just begun, and there still is a lot to make in both countries. " 
In the calendar of building or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after delays. 
The number of stadiums for the European championship could possibly be cubbyhole from eight to six. 
" We cannot lose any more of time. 
We must work on the " maximum speed, declared the Pr�sident de la Ligue Ukrainian Grigorij Surkis. 
" UEFA always has us in l '? it ". 
One decided on an even more radical measure in Poland. 
The direction of the Polish league of football PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced with Robert Zawlocki, independent manager. 
The commission had met at the request of the minister des Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There would be " a true danger that PZPN is not able of acting in rules ", declared Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP. 
" We assured in a mail the president de l' UEFA that the preparations of the European Championship of 2012 would not suffer from it. " 
Several members of the league of First Division were, already in the previous season, condemned for manipulation of obligatory transportation; when all is said and done, the beginning of the League has even of the being brought forward in last minute. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid counter-attacks 
She wanted to make promotion for a new film, spoke about her private life in an interview - and has troubles with her ex now: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the voile on her illegitimate ex Dennis Quaid. 
It foams - and counter-attack. 
A war of the late Rose for the ex couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years afterwards their divorce, both Hollywood actors devote themselves to an ugly battle - openly and publicly. 
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed herself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about reasons of the failure of marriage: " Dennis was for a long time faithless to me, and it was very painful. " 
It would have acquainted with the expanse of deceit only after divorce. 
The motive of this striptease of thought domiciles in the relations of press of Ryan for its new film " The Women " - am told the history of an adultery there. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on its skills of faithless husband fell apparently: it would Be "monstrous ", said this one in "New York Daily News", 54 years, that " Meg chews again once again on the history of our relation and manipulates it ". 
It would be of more "regrettable ", than " trouble and confusion that include a divorce for every child is once again reanimated publicly " for their common son of 16 years Jack. " 
While Ryan lives alone since divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the father of twins. 
So his answer to the blow of label was: " Anyway, my life goes on. 
I feel myself happy to have a marvellous family which goes at best ". 
The prices of plane tickets and hotels fall 
In the first half of year 2008, thefts and nights of hotels were less dear than the previous year. 
In Germany, to an actual study, thefts would be even reduced jusqu' has 50 as one hundred. 
Thefts and nights of hotel would have become again favourable - it is the result of a study of the contractor of financial services and trips American Express. 
The firm analysed its data of reservations of the first semester of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a net fall of benefits in the second quarter. 
After prices on the market of hotels augment during years, the nights of hotels have already reduced in many places. 
From January till March, prices augmented 6,9 in 41 of 48 European cities examined still for one hundred on average compared with 2007 in 41 of 48 examined European cities. 
From April till June, prices were however already 3,6 for lower one hundred than the previous year. 
Tendency was net especially in Paris and in Rome, where the passengers owed paid from 30 to 37 for one hundred less than one year earlier. 
Reasons of all that would domicile for American Express in the weak price of the dollar which drove to a " desire of trips in fall of the American tourists ". 
The financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be of even more affected by the detachment of the prices of the hotels than industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, the prices of hotels are held with an increase in 26,3 for one hundred, record in Europe. 
Also in price of thefts, tendency was in increase in the first quarter: 
Due to the increase of the price of kerosene, the passengers in economic class have of pay 7,1 on average for one hundred more than in 2007, thefts long - mail, very consumer of combustible, even augmented until 29,2 for one hundred. 
From April till June, the prices of tickets in economic class fell on average of 12,5 for one hundred compared with the previous quarter, in class bustle about and in first class however, valuable variations were broadly less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices knew an even more important fall than in other European countries: 
From January till March, prices had augmented 11,9 for one hundred, in the second quarter, they fell of 23,6 for one hundred. 
German internal thefts were even divided by two according to this study. 
The reasons of this fall of prices would be on the one hand a fl�chissante economic fast growth, explains the business company. 
Request c�derait of the ground in a lot of segment of the market of trips by air. 
On the other hand, there would be a pressure accentuated by competition all over the treaty " opened Sky " which liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of tense situation is abolition by the airlines of non-lucrative itineraries, as well as well brought up number of airlines which would have deposited the balance sheet during the first semester 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing in Europe. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a purpose and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes first of the classification. 
In Borussia, Luhukay still did not succeed in finding one eleven functional. 
Of Kristoffer Klein. Extend. Crash landing for Marko Marin international player. 
The player of Gladbach came back only into game late and his raised shooting failed against her frame of purpose. 
His message was precisely formulated, he had gone out of the lips in a convincing manner. 
He knew simply that he was right. 
" We need this second purpose ", hissed Hermann Rieger in the hall of the cloakroom of the arena of Hamburg. 
It did not take place big thing in cloakroom, half been finished and the most part had sat down again on their place. 
Rieger was during almost three decades the physical therapist of the HSV, he enjoys a big reputation as many ancient protagonists. 
And that's why his request was accepted in the strategical places. 
The entraineur helper Cornelius Jol has acquies� and raised the thumb to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the chief entraineur of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Orders of which seem to have been similar: and that this jumps with this second purpose! 
The putting into practice missed. 
" Everything was not very nice to see today ", confessed later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard " would also have liked to be more slack ". 
This 1:0 (1:0 in half), the team of Hamburg owes it to a striking of the head achieved by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not play evil to the weak players of Hamburg. 
" This was a nasty win ", summed up sailor Jol. 
SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121 years on Monday. 
Already on Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated, the blue sky above the arena and the pictures of interim classification themselves on the huge screen which pointed out their club as first of the class. 
This is going to be a birthday without true holiday. 
" We know how to take detachment ", said Marcell Jansen. 
It suspects that the intermediate result of the picture reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV. 
The team with his comers late hired - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric very as Jansen laid off by FC Bayern - forms certainly slowly, but it still does not shine. 
" We need more charm and more dribbles ", Jol demanded.

Dark material influences the theft of the space sondes 
Many years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in confusion: dark material influences the speed of the space sondes during what they call man? uvres of swing-by. 
The experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not absolutely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space "Ulysses " sonde flies in the space. 
Due to conductions of combustible soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens it. 
Many years, a mysterious phenomenon is reason of distress among the researchers - the anomaly of the swing-by. 
The swing-by is a man? uvre of the space sondes, by whom they acquire an additional impulse in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, the Earth for instance. 
So, sondes can economize a lot of combustible. 
The sonde of am�rico-European research Cassini-Huygens used this physical smartness, very as the solar sonde Ulysses. 
It is what surprises the researchers besides many years: objects steering wheels do not always act in 100 for one hundred manners from which they expect for it according to the venerable laws of gravitation. 
Much more, changeability appears at the level of the speed. 
Sondes become in an unexpected way quicker or slower. 
Up to now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They called it the anomaly of the swing-by. 
Certain experts feared that the theory of the general relativity of Albert Einstein, which represents the force of charm of material due to the curve of the space, can not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler de l' Institute for Advanced Study de Princeton always thinks hard as iron that Einstein did not make a mistake and tries to explain the anomaly of the swing-by with the aid of what they call black material that the astronomers identified in the world. 
" Black material could be responsible for this anomaly, material which is also close to the Earth ", he writes. 
The researchers of the space know the existence of black material only for about ten years. 
It emanates obviously from her a force of charm effect of which is visible on other celestial bodies. 
It, on the contrary, is absolutely invisible, that is she sends nor reflects no electromagnetic expulsion, particularly no visible light. 
According to the counting of the scientists, black material would really represent the fifth check of the whole mass of the world. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be liberated as well as the Italian minister des Affaires �trang�res confirmed it. 
The Sudanese abductors had demanded a several million euro ransom. 
During the fusillade preceding release, six takers of hostage would have been killed. 
In the south of Egypt, German five were taken away. 
Negotiations for ransom would be already hired. 
The German are continuously in the bad books of baby snatchers. 
ONLINE WELT represents the most important cases. 
The European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are obviously free. 
It is what announced together Egyptian state television, Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian mass media. 
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed release after the newsletters of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: " Our fellow-countrymen and other hostages were liberated. 
We are proving their state of health ", told Frattini. 
The five German, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian accompanists carry well and are in security, announced Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants of excursion in the desert should already be under way towards Cairo. 
Circumstances around a fusillade before the release of the hostages remain still blurred: so, the baby snatchers would have been near to put an end to abduction, according to the statements of an agent of Egyptian security, before the Sudanese army kills six of the baby snatchers without shouting railway station. 
" Problem was resolved. 
They agreed with a ransom ", declared the agent. 
It more did not remain than to gather the hostages ", when suddenly, " this surprise " occurred. 
Sudanese soldiers had slaughtered on Sunday six of the abductors in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and stopped two of them. 
The takers of hostage had demanded of Germany a ransom of a six million euro sum; silver must be delayed by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The daily " El Masri El Jom " declared that, according to the statements of a German mediator, the release of the hostages took delay because the baby snatchers feared for their security. 
According to the article, the abductors wanted to liberate the female hostages after the payment of ransom. 
The men must be kept until the abductors find a sure road to run away. 
The German embassy in Cairo refused to make any comment on this tale. 
Abuse of a stepfather " who led to the suicide " 
A court was informed that years of abuses inflicted by his stepfather led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, of Stithians, in Cornouailles, was imprisoned during six years having accepted eight counts of indictment for ways of improper facts. 
The higher level court of Truro consulted that it linked regularly her stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during its childhood, from 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: " I feel responsible for his death ". 
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34-year-old, committed suicide at her in Mutley, Plymouth, on the April 1st, 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied it and bandaged before forcing it in sexual acts, while his mother worked on the pub. 
Trerise and his wife divorces in the eighties, and it turned food in Cornouailles. 
His stepdaughter left to Plymouth. 
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, diligent voluntary of National Cartel, was haunted of abuses which had been twice inflicted on him a week. 
The public prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife declared in the court that friends had told that Melle Randle, which was a good surfer and cyclist, has seemed since 2006 " �motionnellement died ", and " had lost any hope towards life. " 
In April, 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, thought she was dead in his flat in Plymouth. 
They think that she committed suicide by choking with a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted the nice father of his daughter who had moreover, written a letter of confession which ended so: " I tied it and bandaged it regularly ". 
" I did not abuse sexually her. 
" I feel responsible for his death. " 
The judge Christopher Elwen said in Trerise: " You are really strange as fetishist, your victim must be terrorized indeed, especially at the age by 7 years. 
" This unpleasant saga ended by the suicide of the victim. 
And what else more amazing, it is the fact that if it had not made this gesture, its history would indeed be finished never in the court ". 
He added: " I underline particularly, such as his father and his mother, the effects of your crime represent it made during years on Stephanie. 
" Without these, she would be probably a happy, promising young woman, and of success today. " 
Condemnation for loss of official data. 
The ministerial officer of the Service Office which had forgotten the top documents secret, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, knew BBC. 
The man of the Ministry of Defence was in displacement when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train towards Waterloo. 
Documents are crossed in the hands of BBC before being delivered to the police. 
Here is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any allusion of criminal intention. 
The correspondent of the BBC, Frank Gardner declared that this episode had people of Whitehall a lot. 
" They will have thought that this affair would have stayed between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office Service " he declared. 
The wage earner who cannot be named, is accused of violation of the section 8.1 of the act, that is to say the clause which treats the maintenance of information. 
.Le Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer is put under the supervision of Metropolitan Police, seen the very sensitive nature of his job linked to the Committee Associate of Secret Services 
The documents which it lost contained evaluations on Al-Qaeda as well as on the means of force of security in Iraq. 
He was informed about decision, on Monday morning and then transported from his home towards a secret place. 
Societies of the building faced with the bill B*B. 
The British societies of the building could have to pay a bill of more than 80 � millions, to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford et Bingley. 
The Government provided 14 � billions to protect stores of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford and Bingleys. 
Interest of this loan will be paid by all societies which harvest the silver of the savers, including 59 societies of the building. 
The managing director of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles declared that it is "annoying" to know that societies and their members will have to pay the broken pots? 
The 14 loan � billions will be reimbursed when Bradford's mortgages and Bingleys will be clear. 
But the interests which are going to augment at the same time, will be debited, every year, in the 700 finance companies which harvest stores. 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed in BBC, that the 59 societies of the building are include in this list. 
It is annoying to see that the institutions with a careful behaviour? now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions which were much less careful. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
They proclaim that every society must pay a sum proportional to stores which it detains, and that the intermediate societies have to pay about 18 % of the expense. 
The Treasury thinks that the interests of the loan will rise in 2009, in �450 millions. 
It means that societies will have to find 81 � millions to regulate the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, managing director of the commercial committee of the societies of the building, declared in BBC that this decision seemed to him unfair. 
It is "annoying" to see that the institutions with a careful behaviour during resumption of the property market, now have to pay for the much less careful institutions. 
According to BSA, no society has failed since 1945, date of the first annals. 
" we must examine all aspects of this affair during next weeks, for � � valuer options � to adopt for � � viter that soci � � t � � s of b � � timent and their members pay this bill sal � � e� � has d � � clar � � M . Cole. 
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March. 
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interests of the whole year, which could besides double. 
In view of the fact that the societies of the building are organizations without stockholder, their member end up paying the bill is by more well brought up expenses, or by lower interest rates for count savings. 
The milk augments penny until five in the litre 
People of Stocking stitch have to pay more for their milk 
Stocking stitch Dairy announced that she was going to augment price roughly by her milk, by five penny in the litre, from Monday.

An ex-Pm of Bangladesh saw itself refusing the deposit 
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request of deposit to the ex PM sheikh Hasina, which risks so being stopped during its return to the country. 
His lawyers said that the court refused to confer on him its deposit because of its indictment to have extorted from a business man, 50 million Takas ($729.000,00) when it was PM. 
This case is one of numerous accusations which are addressed to him. 
Khaleda Zia, the rival of always of sheikh Hasina, was discharged under deposit earlier this month ci. 
Sheikh Hasina should come back to Bangladesh before some weeks, but his party, League Awani, demanded that the interim military government of the country gives him its whole freedom first. 
Correspondents underlined that the terms of his release are contradictory because if they authorize him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free in his return to Bangladesh. 
His lawyers announced that she will now call the Supreme Court against order of Run it Supreme.

New inquiry in the affair of the American prosecutors. 
The American Advocate-General named a special accuser to prove the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006. 
The whole is born in the report of the affair of the general inspector of the department of justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers. 
The report was critical towards officers of the White House, of legislators and the ex Public prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales. 
The inquiry blends in on the thesis of the lawyers who support that their dismissal is of in political reasons. 
The Special accuser, Nora Dannehy will investigate now to know if the officers questioned during the inquiry, lied to the interviewers, obstructing justice so. 
" Serious accusations of behaviour potentially criminal, not founded, were not entirely confirmed nor solved ", declared the inspector general, Glenn Fine, in his relationship. 
The nomination of a special accuser able of forcing witnesses to give evidence, one of its biggest recommendations was. 
Dispute begins nine American prosecutors with expulsion in December, 2006 formulated by the American Department of Justice. 
In epoch, the department had declared that the prosecutors were laid off because of mediocre benefits. 
But it appeared then, that the laid off prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, what encouraged certain watchers to allocate a political connotation in these dismissals. 
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Republicans of the Congress, while others would have refused to investigate regarding the accusations of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
The American prosecutors investigate and follow judicial authorities for the government. 
It is sure that they can be laid off at any instant, but cannot l ' be for political reasons. 
The head of department of justice, the public prosecutor Alberto Gonzales, finishes defendant to be involved in this affair of dismissal, and at the end, he resigned. 
A certain number of ministerial officers of the department of justice too gave their resignation. 
The report of the inspector general was very critical towards the role of Mr Gonzales in this affair, declaring that it considered it " first representative " of these dismissals, and finishes to "surrender " its leader's role, " to be succeeding remarkably in not not implicated in this affair. 
Other ministerial officers, including ancient collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, were critical not to have succeeded in collaborating during the inquiry. 
The epic poem of Meat Loaf will have to be honoured. 
Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured in Q Awards for his epic singing Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will accept an Oscar during the ceremony to London, next week, declared to be "honoured" to acquire this recognition. 
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit of the album of Meat Loaf of 1977. 
The party of valuable delivery is introduced by Coldplay, with this year, a selection was restrained to four categories. 
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q magazine, declared: " There are songs which transcend things as time and type, and Bat Out Of Hell in fact indeed left 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requested a big voice as that of Meat Loaf. 
It begins with an instrumental section which lasts almost two minutes. 
The song was put trade in the United Kingdom there, as single in 1979, ranking on the fifteenth place. 
Besides, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English classifications, and was sold in more than 40 million copies worldwide. 
Meat Loaf-or Marvin Lee Aday, of his true name suffered from problem of health these last years, being even subjected to an operation to cure sound a flapping of c? ur become irregular, having collapsed on stage, in 2003.

Then they found him a cyst in vocal chords. 
A Dark Street in the City, often Forgotten, and Can Be soon for sale. 
New York disposes hundred of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, certain famous, others only functional. 
. And even certain taxis veterans as well as longstanding local inhabitants do not know how to give indications to go to Extra Place, because they have never intended it to speak. 
The street is in East Village and goes through the north of First Street-not to be merged with Second Street-between Actual Bowery and Second. 
About 30 feet broad for 120 long, it resembles a path full of dust rather than an active artery. 
. No panels point out the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas. 
This street has admirers however. 
For instance, there is Avalon Bay, the constructor of the recent luxury buildings on First Street. 
He would like to re-lay with cobblestones Extra Place, and to create a more fluid passage towards stores and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including longstanding neighbours, declared to be charmed by it shortened simply because there remains one of the last and the more ancient streets of the patty of houses. 
But the Department of Preservation and the Property Development of the city which manages the street, has no interest to keep it. 
This month, during a meeting of the committees of owners of neighbourhood, representatives of agency City and Avalon Bay designed a proposal authorizing the property constructor to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street stays in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to be subjected next month, declared Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee n�3. 
" There remain only few areas belonging to the city, and we would wish that the city keeps Place Extra " she declared. 
" They could offer to repair it and to manage it, what besides Avalon could make, but we like to support him public. " 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago she wanted to re-lay with cobblestones the side street and to install in it seats, some would besides be used by a coffee to which the constructor will grant the space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month. 
Michele de Milly, carries it word of Avalon Bay, declared that although the society wants to exploit the street, it does not mean out of necessity that she wants to be owner there. 
" the main interest of Avalon Bay is of a relooker this abandoned path, and to make public it " she declared, underlining that it was the city to suggest him sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a door word of the Preservation of Real estate, confirmed that the city definitely liked to sell the street, underlining besides, that the mission of the agency was to develop ownership rather than manage it. 
Having compared with the more coloured neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a light historical footprint. 
Some people think that Extra Put door this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the big farm of numerous children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving this small end of earth of quoting, who remained since left. 
The later entrance of CBGB, a punk monument rock closed in 2006, has r� opened to Extra Place; the street is indeed more famous thanks to the photograph in coverage of the album of Ramones " Rocket to Russia " 
" this place was splendid " declared Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photograph in November, 1976. 
It was full of scrap metal, tatters, barrels, posters, of leaves and ropes. " 
Certain inhabitants, including the bloggeurs which had already spoken about evolution towards the luxury of East Village, opposed at the idea of selling Place Extra, saying that this unassuming small ownership should remain public. 
Others proclaimed Place Extra as a true curiosity a fragment virtually identical to the city which should be rotten in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who drives a blog called Jeremiah' s Vanishing New York (captioned " The Book of Protests: A bitterly Nostalgic Look on A City in the Process of Redemption ") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: " Extra Place is a small narrow, dark dead end street of day as night, and delimited by the doors of a made rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of newspapers of last week which fly off along gutters. " 
In not enough exceptions near, the street always has the same paces. 
A rat runs with agility in the bottom of the alleyway, near a door which led to CBGB in the past, and that now became the seat of a store of clothes chic. 
Graffitis on walls, a bottle of empty 22-ounce beer, rests in quoted by newspapers which have just just been thrown. 
Some passers-by declared to think only seldom of Extra Place, and suggested of its emphasizing. 
Mr Field, of quoted sound, declared to think that certain pence estimated the attraction of the street in its present state. 
" The best years of my life " he declared, " took place in filthy and dark, humid places ". 
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language 
In this party of the program of Supervision of Education, Bruce Fuller and Spear T. Izumi discusses the position of the candidates regarding bilingual education. 
Spear T. Izumi, the ancient member of studies in California, and the ancient manager of the department of education to the Pacific Research Institute for public Policy, is the co-author of the book " not However good You Think of it. Why the medium classes must be able to choose their school. " 
To attract favours of the Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr Obama underlines that " the Afro-American and latin students have less than chance to award a diploma than the white students. " it is a true fact. 
To fight this difference, the program of education of Mr Obama supports particularly among so much other subjects, bilingual transitional education " for those who learn English. 
However, the question which settles for Obama is to know if its wish to accomplish a bilingual education which defends education in class of languages others than English, goes besides its interest aiming at eliminating difference. 
Take a primary school for instance, Sixth Street Prep, from the east of the narrating of Los angeles. 
The students of this school are in great majority Hispanic, and of low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, constituted of numerous new arrived, studies English. 
Among the students of CM1, 100 % took the exam of State of maths of 2008, expert level. 
Also, almost 93 % of the students took the exam of English - of langues-d ' arts 
This unconvincing success was attained thanks to another ingredient than that moved forward by Mr Obama. 
Sixth Street bets on analyses, of practice, constant valuation of capacities as well as exemplary attitude. 
On top of that, and here is an example which Mr Obama could copy, brings back Linda Mikels, main of Sixth Street, this school instituted the education of the English language " full immersion ". 
The complete immersion in English language focalizes on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Melle Mikels, opposite to bilingual education, asserted me " we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months afterwards, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance to identify it. " 
" It walks, she notices, " it walked for us " 
Mr Obama should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and to retort it in other schools composed in the majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
Very good results acquired by this school speak about them even; but policies on education inside its party (Associations for State education support bilingual education for a long time) and his huge support in favour of bilingual education, make dark prognosticate it of the answer of Mr Obama. 
Although it is favourable by the way the immigrants learn English, Mr Obama newly considered this question as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all owe to stop entering into a debate on the wording of laws in English language. 
" Contrariwise, he declared, " you must be sure that your child speaks Spanish ". 
If Mr Obama really likes to eliminate difference, he should then consider with attention, the models of education which work, rather than to despise them or to consider them as insignificant. 
Net Fall of Oil further to the New Anxiety of the world of Economy 
The prices of oil fell distinctly on Monday, because people fear that the plan of rescue in favour of steps financiers, succeeds in giving again life in economy. 
The urgent operations of crude oil, fell 7 for one hundred arriving at $99.80 the barrel. The Commercial Stock Market of New York, during sales of this morning.

On Monday, the investors are once again anxious in spite of agreement on the plan of rescue, the biggest of history, concluded this week end by the leaders of the Congress. 
News was attenuated by the recent concerns according to which crisis would be durative. 
In the very last episode of this financial disaster, " Citygroup will buy the banking of Wachovia Corporation, declared the government on Monday. 
At the same time, governments Belgian, Dutch and of Luxembourg in party nationalized the financial European conglomerate, Fortis. 
The analysts of Key Barclays declared that the frenetic negotiations of this week end, concluded with the agreement of rescue " seem not to have succeeded in making relive the market ". 
While financial standing should damage, ask for it in raw materials, oil including should decelerate. 
" the futurology of total equity, rate of interest and exchange of markets, became uncertain " the analysts of Deutsche Bank in a letter to their investors wrote. " 
" we think that raw materials will not be able to avoid this contagion. 
" As regards raw materials, our the most pressing worries is that to understand when the American virus would spread on the whole and particularly, in China ". 
The analysts of the bank reduced their wait for next year, saw the falls of consumption of oil owed to the slowing down of economic fast growth, being therefore made diminish of 20 for hundred, the predictions of the prices of oil and gas for 2009. 
The Decisive holiday of the Second Time for the Improvement of the Record of the Team. 
Having passed during these last eight seasons, more time than whoever in uniform of Throws Shaun Ellis, the defender thought have seen everything. 
He looked the second time, when Throws transformed one 0 - 0 into an explosion. 
" I have ever seen nothing from this type " Ellis declared. 
The second time began after Throws and Arizona Cardinals badly play clouds under obscure. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded in making a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12 yard touchdown, harbinger of one after midday during who their relation made a bound forward. 
Favre found Coles for another two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner-kick fell and second, in 10 seconds of half. 
" I did not go out of my zone " Favre declared regarding all her passes in Coles. 
" it is a mediocre player " 
" We communicated extremely definitely, in spite of what think of people. " 
While Favre and Coles played the wrestling, defence beat the quarter back of Cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Comes alive again, to hoot back, intercepts a lost shooting and was 32 yards up to the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made other one passes and intercepted her. 
Linebacker, David Bowens let get away the ball because of Warner. 
In the last change, the loss of the ball of Bowens, could definitely be the most delightful event 
Cardinals took the control of this possession during last 10 seconds, and then Throws recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20 yard goalkeeper taking an advantage from 34 to 0. 
It was the best that Throws can mark at time. 
" The coach of Throws, Eric Mangini, who they asked to represent this madness, declared " the second time or the third? " 
When they said to him two Throws let through 21 incontestable points in the third time Mangini declared: " I can say to you that I more appreciated the second time than the third. 
. " Many goals were scored in next to no time. " 
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds the worldwide record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved be worthy of his title of better long-distance runner of the century, having broken his own record of the world in the marathon of Berlin on Sunday, becoming so the first to run 26,2 milles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With a win in 2 :03 :59 of accommodating running on the dish, Gebrselassie broke of 27 seconds the record of 2 :04 :26, competed last year in Berlin. 
In 35 years, Gebrselassie carried off the 26th world record of the superb career during which he carried off World championship or worldwide record for any distance, of 1600 metres of marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing can be of a manner exaggerated with the today's eyes, - that the pollution of air augments its problems of asthma. 
Contrariwise, he promised to run to Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions sunny time, 48 degrees at first, 55 at arrival Gebrselassie wins on Sunday, supporting an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The racers of lane as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into long-distance runners, contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in these last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05. 
After the win of Sunday, Gebrselassie declared to the correspondents, to have suffered from cramps in the calf two weeks before, and missed training during week. 
It is obvious that repose allowed him of bright, but not made rusty staying. 
" I am so happy, " he declared to the reporters. 
" Everything was perfect. 
I recovered last week, and there today, I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best. "" 
They reproached him especially in for Kenya, the rival is Africain of Ethiopia of credit too much to orchestrate his shopping, by avoiding the worldwide stars of the marathon, counting in fact on hares as though they were in a competition of lane, and considering more worldwide records than sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the capacities of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner. 
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1 :02 :04. at the mi way. 
Two Kenyan racers of elite, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued outbraving Gebrselassie after the heads of line disappear. 
In a little more than three milles arrival, Gebrselassie made the final rise to break loose from Kwambai, which ends second in 2 :05 :36, ameliorating its best personal record of five minutes. 
Kamathis is arrive third in 2:07:48. 
In female running, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, supporting German citizen, ended a remarkable year acquiring the seventh time of 2:19:19. 
English Paula Radcliffe holds worldwide record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, was surprising everybody carrying off London Marathon in 2:24:14. 
She should not can participate in the games of Beijing because of a hypothetical evil in the back, but promised to win in Berlin, ameliorating in his third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It ran making appeal in a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian racers and k�nyans to take a nice advantage, exceeding them then about 18 miles � afterwards. 
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, ended third in 2:25:01. 
In a separate City, Arrogance and tests of Black Life 
Hidden in the development of its huge park, in some milles of the sunny, the bright and the giantess Orlando, a small quiet city is where are born pride and complications of afro-American experience. 
" Eatonville, first entirely black city to insert, home of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description which it made in 1935, is not so simple any more to make at present. " The city in five lakes, three courts of croquet, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison ". 
It now became a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to most famous Hurston, the writer of Harlem Renaissance. 
And of various manners, the city where it represented became tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide of the Florida edited by The Depression-era Federal Writers ' Project-remains a separate place. 
It is as independent, worthy, and private as she has been her already in the thirties, when Hurston told that the black country population of Florida was often reticent to share its true thoughts with the white man, who " knowing us so not much, does not know what he loses ". 
Even if it is about the year of the election of a black president, the senator Barack Obama, who besides invoked a dialogue opened on the topic of the breed, a lot here remain careful of look from abroad. 
" we are very careful as for the manner of telling history " Hortense Jones, 59 years old, inhabitant always and the most ancient parishioner of the city declared. 
" it is necessary that it complies with reality. 
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of triumph and battles. 
It represents at the same time a historical model of a catch of power of the blacks as well as a community of almost 2400 persons where the rate of poverty is twice national average. 
It is about a central point but also about an example of black country culture sometimes despised Confederate, others cheered time which reminds of the birth of American serfhood. 
What would explain why the inhabitants are proud at the same time and protectors. 
Interest towards the picture of Eatonville been born with Zora, that everybody here calls Hurston. 
It introduced its home town in the whole world through the sincere books, full of dialect, such as " Female mules and Men " (1935) and " "Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937)". 
Five paragraphs in the guide of Florida transformed this city, located just at the exit of Road 17, a road which crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, that succeeds in chapter of black history and human drama. 
Daring person such a big case in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the store of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
" after the road on the left ", she writes, " you will think brown and white state school modern, with its gardens and these aeries of game kept well after which Howard Miller always looked, although he barely knows how to read and to write. 
She besides mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of any type as well as all that can be of use for people of passage. 
Therefore, in barely a hundred of words, Hurston linked Eatonville to an auto government but also to the analphab�tisation, to a remarriage, and to a sex. 
Naturally, Fodor was not so. 
It was not in fact a portrait which everybody appreciated. 
Zora represented well reality " declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls of Johnson whom Hurston immortalized, naming the colourless songs, interpreted by men who rented their beauty. " 
She added: " certain persons did not appreciate ". 
They always remember Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moves to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, said that Hurston arrived usual in city without informing, on board of big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and carried trousers here, where even today, they are proud of traditional clothes. 
Numerous inhabitants were fascinated, Mr Franklin told, while many people made fun of her. 
" people were always happy to see Zora " he declared. 
But he adds besides, swaying in his chair of the later patio which overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was indeed called, that ' " she has never stayed too much for a long time ". 
On the death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and its pounds were except production. 
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although she was a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and an only black wife of Barnard College of the twenties in the past, she was buried in any tomb, to Strong Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, or of plate for the general public. 
I do not think that they understand the contribution or the inheritance which it gave in the world " declared Val�rie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A critical instant happened in 1980s. 
Public civil servants of Orange County liked to get a freeway in five ways in city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, main street in two ways of the community. 
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 up to the west angle of the city. 
Proposal was made while Eatonville recovered hardly from a difficult period of the history. 
A forced incorporation, among so many other things, put an end to the comparatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the fifties, dispute on the mixture of breeds leads hate near the community. 
" in this epoch there, a band of young whites came to throw oranges or objects against the persons sat on the quoting " declared Mr Franklin. 
" a lady even died. " 
They threw a watermelon of their car ". 
In a letter of 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston calls into question request of Run it Supreme aiming at a forced incorporation, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of insulting " Education rather than glorifieuse of my breed ". 
The inhabitants proclaim now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in certain aspects, diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weaken the trust of the young persons. 
" the black children had habit to be embraced I remember definitely they embraced our master the morning, and in the evening also " N.Y declared. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as chief head of the Maintenance of the Community of Eatonville, a group not benefit. 
It lasted, she added, until the instant when the teachers and the students did not come any more from the same place. 
" You do not embrace your white professor because he is white I mean that there is here, a cultural demarcation line " Melle Nathiri declared. 
Civil rights, besides, allowed to create of the space for many other Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who went besides detriment, such as her, armed with a cheerful clean trust and with lines of conduct such as: " how they can lose the pleasure of my company! " 
It exceeds me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the anonymous tomb of Hurston and begins struggling for making relive its reputation. 
Five years afterwards, a biography cheered on Hurston accomplished by Robert E. Hemenway, a best truth to saddle, reintroduced it so in the American cannons. 
The plan of the freeway arrived just at the time when the most famous daughter of Eatonville had found her attraction. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston consider her to be a rescuer. 
The community began organizing a festival Hurston to show calamitous consequences which would procreate this freeway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the unveiling of the festival two years afterwards, and many people come back in January, to memorialize it. 
After numerous years, the narrating pushed back the proposal of the freeway. 
" The failure of the freeway in five ways, extremely quick, a true civic pride " declared Melle. Nathiri. 
Melle Boyd summed up the every declarant that " Zora saved Eatonville ". 
The win against the plan of the shone freeway allowed to change its own picture. 
Not resident persons, as Rachelle Munson, lawyer who sees frequently our church depuis1993, began coming in big number, and the inhabitants began reconsidering the past. 
Eatonville is classified historical city since 1998. 
A library monoskiing topic (reappointed naturally Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a splendid Kennedy Boulevard, repav�. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: for six milles of Orlando, she can at any instant to be considered as one delays later street during a summer day of rain, baby such as she was when she was founded by 27 black families in 1880s. 
(they count 90 for one hundred blacks today) 
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, the reason to be, are still treated carefully. 
It is necessary to to ask for permission for most interviews, and certain things as the walls of the hurdy-gurdy church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in fields must not be photographed. 
Many people in Eatonville, as Melle Jones, an audacious teacher and with whom a for the lively red, are always afraid that their island community is definitely understood. 
However, seen the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local arrogance is appeared. 
The young persons particularly, tend to consider Eatonville to be Hurston considered his whole breed: nice, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, inventive, hard worker, madwoman and blended that other groups ethnic and racial in America. 
It is a lot of sincere civic disease which they hear in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, that plans to come back to Eatonville after the secondary school to work for the local government or for force of Police, which need additional force. 
And even for the youngest, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learnt description Eatonville correctly. 
" The most part of people, who pass in this zone there, will think: " oh, this city compared nothing with others " Alondra Kenon declared after mass last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take time to consider history, it is a very nice city ". 
Here in New York, all speak finance fluently. 
Nonetheless, nothing changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan were held distant from the newsstand and from huge screens of television on Times Small public garden, they would not realize that they are in l '? it of cyclone. 
Never they could think only in the glassy offices and in nest of honeybee above suckle them, the bankers and the managers of fund of coverage who monopolize New York, cross the worst " working day in the office " since the champion horse of 1929. 
The deliverymen continue basting on sidewalks, with their wagons and their trays of muffins for matini�res meetings. 
The latin always trail along between the residential buildings carrying, as female mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke disposed on its shoulders. 
The clerks continue standing in a queue to buy their sandwich matinier to the ambulant traders, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16 h and 19 h on weekdays. 
I had not smelt crisis in spite of the absolutely pessimistic tales until this after midday when I decided to go to open a new savings account. 
Happily that I had planned to work at the end of after midday, because I discovered in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty standing in a queue persons. 
Not in front of the counters of the cashiers, nor to withdraw kind or make a remittance, but in front of the counter of the customer service, where the habitual customers ordered their check books, the tourists asked for direction for the store Macy, and the new customers opened count. 
The most part of those in front of me, me would teach of Starr, my " personal banker allowed " later, stood in a queue for the same reason that me. 
Not similarly, because they had already withdrawn their savings of the smaller banks, as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their silver of the count of savings called thrifts (such a society of the building), from associations of credit, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries which work only in a state, and that tell treat the customers as their family. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt. 
These last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with capital of $327 made appeal to the property manager of failure, and while New Yorkais came back at the home for the week end on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, in count saves worth $440 millions, searched d�sesp�ramment a purchaser to save it. 
The office and the employees of stores who are in front of me, scared by other one potential breaking up, transferred their silver to a bank which seems to them dependable, is the one who makes most rescue in Wall Street. 
Any New Yorkais became very familiar in the world of finance these last weeks. 
" I heard a lady in my Chinese local supermarket, to speak to the telephone of Lehman Brothers, the bank which went bankrupt, and of his thin managing director Dick Fuld, with the same acquaintance as she would have been able to have to criticize a colleague. 
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our habitual dialogue regarding Brad and Angelina or of deliveries of my trader of fruits and vegetables. 
She said to me, further to my visit the bank. " I put all my savings in the market of the monetary funds. 
" I changed, I do not want to take of risk ".

" I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character " G�nther Bauer - Photographer 
Neither heels, nor clothes of use for the first time. 
The essence of the grand masters of flamenco, liberated from any tensions to acquire the slack aspect of the man or the woman. 
On the one hand the artist. 
Of other one, person. 
Inseparable except in privacy, in these unknown instants of the general public, where they discover in private gestures and of looks stolen from the artists who do not care of going up on stage. 
German G�nther Bauer blends in " Flamenco - people " the dramatic quality of some productions with singers, of dancers and of the guitarists with this side less known by the artists. 
In this plan, the photographer takes back the particular iconography of flamenco under different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the Flemish Photograph, exhibition " reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day ", explains the creator, who clarifies that " Flamenco - people " " can be whoever but, having seen photographs, the watcher realizes that these are not pictures typical of artists on stage. 
These photographed persons " on the street " are artists able of transmitting on stage of passion, sadness, joy by enthralling the public. 
To capture instants of personality of these artists you should not make photographs on stage. 
They have a personality and one clean character. 
What interested me it was to create a private atmosphere which allows me to capture with the camera of the instants of personality of the stars of flamenco ". 
With the festival " Folk song of Mines ", Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph the singers, the guitarists or the dancers with a camera with plate. 
It is portraits which, thanks to choice of the camera and the equipment, the classical photograph recollects. 
The bet there? uvre of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of picture, by giving him a key of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: " A music with very traditional roots which evolves and that is surprising every day ". 
It is not about dance nor about singing in itself, but about personality and about character of the artist which enthralls the public with his art. 
The research of the bulk and magic was the constant of this job which they introduce these days ci in the gallery El Fot�mata. 
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, between others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists. 
Plan was transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits displayed in the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led it to repeat idea two years ago with the " Portraits of old sportsmen " (" SportARTproject "). 
Although concepts differ in " Flamenco - people ", the photographer supposes that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their life for more or less long instant. 
I think that in the photograph the portrait is the most difficult type. 
You are in front of persons, in figures that sometimes you do not know or which let you only some minutes for power make them a photograph. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality ". 
This collection of portraits of the actual flamenco which is called " Flamenco - people ", is displayed in the Gallery El Fot�mata, located in the number 20 of the street of Put it down (parallel street to the Peupleraie d' Hercule) which will be opened until October 16th of this year.

The newscaster of the Festival, F�lix Romeo, met faced with a fascinated public who did not see the crossed hour during which the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with a big dose of humour, redrew the birth of his literary vocation, which is owed to " its thirst to read " and " to live on new experiments "; how he wrote of a " very methodic way " thanks to an intense job of material, by correcting and by rewriting a party of the text to face up his " lack of inspiration "; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels. 
The Spanish novelist - American acknowledged that ' " there is not means " to measure and know if pounds change life. " But I refuse to think that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience ", underlined Vargas Llosa, which said that this one " has effects " and " returns less similar people ", because they asked the writers " not to be allowed to go to frivolousness " and to take their vocation.

The coordinator general and delegated by the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, has declared today that it is the regional confederation to make a decision on the case of the ancient adviser of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of S�ville, Francisco Manuel Silva, which resigned last week having been accused of accomplishing treatments of favour to the members of his family.

Nevertheless, the leader of the United Left asked that inquiries show "transparence" for the changeability which Silva would have been able to make: " The United Left always defended this type of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparence ".

" Sangre of Mayo �, the daring bet of Garci 
By drawing inspiration from tales of Benito P�rez Gald�s, Jos� Luis Garci re-creates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in " Sangre of mayo ", which is the most ambitious film of its filmography with about 15 million euro of budget. 
The film-maker tried " to stage numerous figures and to illustrate the social analysis " that he always admired in l '? uvre of the famous novelist, he has explained during the presentation of the film, with Quim Guti�rrez and Paula Echevarr�a today at the head of actors' long list. 
The film of a length of more than two hours and a half, " Sangre of mayo � will make the exit in cinemas next Friday, which will become then a series televised for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Big admirer of the literature of Gald�s, Jos� Luis Garci assures to have accomplished with this filming child's dream " thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, which made responsible it, three years ago, for shooting a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2nd of Madrid, thing that it always accepted when the tale was held in national historical facts. 
The 15 million euro provided by the Village of Madrid constitute for Garci a " unique opportunity " to reproduce with decors and appropriated clothes ambience of ' " Spain which made a mistake about leader for battle, since, the conflict for independence drove the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII ", it signalled. 
But the film-maker regrets not having acquired a financing as for films " captain Alatriste � or " The ghosts of Goya � - more double of that acquired for " Sangre of mayo �-, because he could not turn some stages written in a script signed by Horacio Valc�rcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career. 
The film-maker of " Volver has empezar � influences how habitual he works, on the production of the actors, with whom he has habit to repeat before beginning the filming and in which he does not make casting, since it seems to him "mortifying" and considers that " the role of the film-maker is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to be held inform ". 
Many actors in " Sangre of mayo " repeat in front of the camera, as Miguel Rell�n, of Carlos Larra�aga or Fernando Guill�n Cuervo. 
Four times candidate for the Oscar (he earned one), Garci considers that the three films candidates who represent Spain this year to the Academy of Hollywood, " Sangre of mayo �, " Seven tables of French billiards � and finally the victor, The blind sunflowers ", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, " who would be worth being better known ", he declared. 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
" At the beginning you think that you work for the posterity, then you realize that you work that for prosperity, and now you content yourself with making a film on top of that ", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career. 
Isabel Bay�n puts on in the skin of the s�villane dancer T�rtola Valencia 
A s�villane dancer is going to pay tribute to a dancer also s�villane. 
Carmen T�rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren� T�rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the quarter of Triana and which at the age of three years will go to live in London with its family. 
It was a dancer of free dance and specialist of oriental dances. 
It had an exciting life, pioneer of the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abrogation of the girdle which prevented the free movement of the women. 
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the interwar period, fascinated Isabel Bay�n. 
" I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last offered me to interpret the dancer s�villane T�rtola Valencia and it seemed to me unconvincing ". 
According to the dancer, " we do not try to tell her life but to translate how it thinks. 
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco. 
So, " the dance of the butterfly " made me think of a Cuban popular dance and " the dance of the snake " in certain tangos. 
His dance was sensual and they said to me that my manner of dancing was identical to his ", she asserts. 
The production was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela in one once again of its shows, as it had made in " The puerta abierta "; and that of the professor Matilde Coral, who was unusually kind enough to collaborate with the one who was her pupil. 
" Matilde transforms T�rtola into a mature figure. 
I am happy because it agreed to play a role in my? uvre and it honours me ". 
The production also made Pulga thanks to musical composition and guitars of Jes�s Torres y Paco Arriaga, in popular song of Michel Ortega, el there Me of Mor�n; in the percussions of El P�jaro, as well as in the viol of Rafa El Viola and in the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju�rez, " who plays the role of the endless companion of this artists' type who were considered to be divas ". 
This? uvre also tells, in a sense, the life of this woman who showed herself in so distant places, especially for epoch, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also in all Europe, since she domiciled habitually in London. 
" I wanted to recollect her because I think that it is these women with a huge influence in their epoch and now nobody knows and emphasizes sound? uvre ", asserts Bay�n. 
Show will begin at 20 h 30 in the theatre Lope de Vega 
The publication of the " Newspaper of a poet newly married " concludes the Triennial 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated with the " Newspaper of a Poet newly married " in the church Holy Stephen' s in New York, place where Juan Ram�n Jim�nez got married to Zenobia in March, 1916, registers as part of activities envisaged by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the " Triennial Zenobia and Juan Ram�n " (2006-2008), having organized to memorialize the fiftieth birthday of the concession of the Nobel prize of Literature and their deceases.

Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the " Newspaper of a poet newly married ", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo P�rez-Enciso, to perpetuate l '? uvre most known andalous of one of the poets. 
Plait America less without Paul Newman 
" Times God creates perfect persons 
Paul Newman was part of it ". 
This sentence is of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in " Absence of mischief ", and illustrates well the despair of the American cinema, and all America, faced with remarkable idea that Newman is not any more of this world. 
It experienced difficulty in acquiring an Oscar 
It did not turn any more since 2007. 
Everybody knew that he was sick. 
It was a hard blow for everybody. 
" Sometimes what the one feels exceeds any expression, and now I loses a big friend ", Robert Redford cried, " my life and my country were better thanks to its existence ". 
Nobody was afraid to go ridiculous or to go too far. 
One of the fathers of the cinema and fatherland died during particularly obscure period, when the terrorists and stock markets frighten, the respect of the Americans fell very low, by searching motives of respectability hopelessly. 
When time is so hard and without reason to live, the human beings have only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It represented for everybody an ideal of beauty and the truth. 
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and conquered reasons, as foundation for battle antinarcotics created in favour of elder sound died further to an overdose and the creation of his own mark of food bio. 
It was a win for a country which experienced difficulty in being obvious against a suicidal food culture. 
This exuberant wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention either to nationalities or to passports. 
Last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that no James Bond died before him. 
Another Englishman, the oscaris� Sam Mendes, said that to work with Newman marked the summit of its career. 
The poor boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his biggest inspiration. 
" It put us the high bar ", determined George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to pierce the screen as Paul Newman made it: being very honn�t and by had a serious private life and far from objectives. 
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle at present. 
But there is the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, it was married fifty-year-old to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if opportunities did not miss him not to be her. 
" But why should I eat a hamburger away from me, if I have a steak in my fridge? ", it had habit to joke. 
In the sky, it attends with arrogance the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so habitual in America. 
" Among all big roles that it interpreted, it was never proud as as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and philanthropist ", he say. 
Madrid in running in the organization of the Olympic Games of 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016. 
But me I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of yesterday running: we are not him! 
They call it perfect running, but according to me it was the worst running in which I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all errors happened during running, these would make the object of an eliminatory note. 
But let us examine very in detail and from the beginning. 
Errors begin with the collection of numbers, which makes you go there ahead of time. 
It is not wrong but if they make you move it would be better that they give you everything (including the microchip for shopping). 
And definitely not 
They made you there only go to take the number (first error, move only for it) and (after a long line of wait) surprised! there was only size ' S ' as the undershirt (second error, because I need a size XL) 
In what world live we? 
It is it because of crisis that they decided to buy that undershirts of small size with less cloth and the blow less dear? 
Oh well, this is nothing in comparison with what took place the day of shopping. 
Apart from the fact that to go it is necessary to there very early to withdraw the microchip, the line of wait is of 15 minutes and, besides, it is necessary to to leave its backpack at the entrance. 
Wait lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that one wait for 11.000 persons for this shopping. 
Since it has had a long line of wait there, competitions began and we had not left our backpack at the entrance, yet well which once made, the collection was worse. 
Besides, the rain accompanied the wait of for more than 40 minutes which took place rebellions and attacks of the shack. 
I think that about 500 persons will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and certain persons as me, shall not even appear in in due time precise classification, because of the flea who they gave me who, I think, did not mark departure correctly. 
Of course, if they asked me to name an example of perfect running, this one would not especially come to me to idea. 
So I think that we shall always be able to dream to become the city guest for J.O. of 2016. 
Microsoft searches a (virtual) receptionist 
In conference on Emergent Technologies of SHOULD PUT Microsoft was introduced a new system of recognition of picture and human correlation, a kind of Artificial intelligence endowed with not enough secret relations but able of fulfilling some basic tasks, as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move in the campus of the firm) in reply to what they asked for him during a dialogue. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many persons there is in the place, which they are - including to remember which posts they occupy - and to listen and to hear the key words of their dialogues. 
But also regroup them according to groups of dialogue 
In the video of presentation, the receptionist discerns a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group which is speaking with her and that she is not part of the firm. 
She asks him if she is here to visit somebody and she says to her that she will answer him in some instants. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course it represents future. 
Now the firm has other things on which to concentrate, for instance on the next version of its operational system, Windows. 
This week they spoke besides a change of strategy to Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will have no more so much linked programs. 
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of useless applications, they would go five times as quickly. 
It represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, did not stop adding of functions and "Extras" with Windows. 
The change of strategy is the welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses of importance but also its software. 
When Google Chrome arrived on network, I was one of those who stuck to theory according to who Google Chrome is the first step on behalf of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several persons underlined rightfully that an Internet navigator is not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the necessary foundation so that the computer equipment and software understand each other. 
It occupies the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your stepmother. 
That's true. 
It will never disappear but it is necessary to see the "death" of the operational system not as the absolute truth but since the relating truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People pay attention less and less to the operational system but more and more to the Internet navigator. 
They light the computer only to make turn Firefox, Explore or Chromium and every day people spend more time to sail Internet than to go through windows. 
For whom is of use the half of applications provided with the system? 
Who can most can least. 
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Less heavy, blocked, less complex month. 
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in the launching of its own online services so that they become finally an alternative in Google. 
They hopelessly need it, in effect, and I show you an example. 
The present photograph in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rooms of repose reserved for the employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the drinks vending machine, a poster asks them to use their own research tool - " Your research. Our future ". 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66 % of the employees of Microsoft used Google to search information on Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Mobile Windows 7. 
She will not go out at the beginning of 2009 but by the end on 2009 or to see in 2010. 
Microsoft will surely try to throw Windows 7 and Mobile Windows 7 at the same time. 
The telephone, after all, resembles a computer more and more. 
But the launching of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, it will cost to them a lot. 
Wonderful Marcel

English calls it 'tank ' but Wonderful Marcel de Bruxelles distinguishes herself among all the others. 
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although it is known under the name of 'Marcel ' - which has to see with sports since he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
'Marcel ' distinguishes himself from others by his very good cotton, by his unisex cup, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) which the most known sleeveless undershirts have in the neck. 
But attention, because Belgian mark produces tank not only only of beeps. 
But it also produces sweatshirt of, of boxers imitating the styles of an earlier period, of cardigans in cashmere, of cotton trousers, of babies, of mini-shorts... 
Clothes conceived for the comfort of undershirts. 
Even it's a pity to carry them only as undershirts. 
They have too much charm.

I think that yes but when all is said and done everything meets and these activities have many things together. 
Since I am very small clothes pleased me; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look in the cupboards of my aunt and to see the clothes. 
It was brilliant, almost better than to go to the attraction park. 
Then, when I became dancer, I always tried to look after of my manner of dressing me. 
The dancers very well like to get dressed for lessons and tests, to look in the mirror and feel definitely.

The recidivists of alcohol in the steering wheel will have to install the ' Alcolock ' system 
The minister de l' Int�rieur wants the driver with more than three administrative sanctions for alcool�mie, to have to install in his vehicle a system which prevents from starting the vehicle in state of drunkenness, or if it is not blowing. 
Initiative was already announced in last June and it appears in the relationship of the Minister of State consequently in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot plan which will last one year. 
His purpose is the reintegration of the driver by offering him lessons of road re-education. 
The Minister of State loaded with the road safety but also the General management of the Road safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Security of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the motorists stopped to have driven in state of drunkenness more than once, take back the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected up on the vehicle which measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents from starting the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is superior to that allowed. 
His expense is superior to 1.000 euro and supported by driver. 
In this respect, a study led to States Unis in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this implement reduced up to 65 % of offences in the course of the first year of installation. 
And in Spain they think that it could save life to 115 persons every year. 
This measure is held that in administrative sanctions for two reasons: face up these behaviours before they are transformed into criminal offences. 
And to make easier his bet there? uvre, since juridical reform can be made by ordinary ways but, however, reform made by criminal ways demands a reform of organic law. 
The implement is still available on the Spanish market under no commercial form, although certain industrial vehicles and of function already has one in title experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish socialist party which offers to install this system in the scholastic buses as it was made in France.

At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
Some hours before I had asked on the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish Princes visited the city to end their official trip. 
- Ah, very well, of blow they will not be able to go to the airport to take customers at this hour ci... Are you or then from here??

But the Mexican press knows very well who are the princes des Asturies and know the importance of trip.

The most prestigious price of fashion 
There is not surely place more appropriated in the world to introduce a price of mode that Paris and there is not surely designer living more extraordinary and good live that Valentino. 
Mango has just introduced the second edition of Bot�n-Mango Fashion Awards, to reinforce the international picture of the new talents of fashion. 
The victor will be rewarded by a 300.000-euro price. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the taken out Belgian victor of the first edition, looked at his models in the window of Mango in 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she mourned it almost of emotion.

Monica Cruz, who came in the store with trousers and shirt? of her own collection - and which for dinner was completely transformed by endorsing a sexy and black long dress, was touched when during the nocturnal visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the repetitions of ballets and by remembering of good old time, it grabbed one of the bars and it made the gesture of one ' big folded '. 
In�s Sastre did not stay for the visit of dependency of the palace, but she showed us on his mobile phone of the photographs of his son before. 
Next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart�nez? another nice man who moves in motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with its sheets, its towels and by having asking in anticipation, that there are not smells in his room.

Speak by sleeping 
Some children speak during night. 
I do not relate to those who wake up very woken up by telling us something that took place the former day, but to the children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time when it arrives this can surprise you, but in reality it does not have importance. 
It is a minor impairment of sleep that is called somniloquie. 
It is rather frequent, especially at the children and at the teenagers. 
It is sure that there is more one who speaks during night. 
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic manner (once in life for instance linked to an episode of strong fever), or in a more periodical manner (every day, one time a week, one time a month), next day the child remembers nothing more. 
There is not unique reason which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other impairments of sleep as nightmares, nocturnal dread, enuresises nocturne (make wee in the bed) or somnambulism, but it is not always case. 
As we have already said it before, they can also be linked to very strong fever, to situations of stress or overexcitement. 
In any case it is a not much studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable. 
It is possible that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with insulated words, of muttering or contrariwise with shouting, tears, long speeches... 
In case the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be judicious to notice the child and to consult a specialist, to prove if there is a problem which causes a lot of anxiety and to acquire an explanation of this problem. 
We said that it is a minor impairment, that's why there is not treatment, safe if it is linked to another impairment of sleep which can be treated (for instance, if it is linked to an apnea of sleep or to stress). 
What they can make it is to take into account a certain number of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Try not to thrill the child before going to sleep. 
As a result search quiet games and avoid programs or television series who are more or less violent. 
With very nervous children and who experience difficulty in relaxing, techniques of relaxation can be used to help them to calm down intensively. 
It will allow to the child to have a more gentle sleep. 
As soon as somniloquies appears try to remain calm. 
Say to you that they are inoffensive for the child and that the following day it will not remember any more of what took place. 
Useful Councils 
Do not awaken it. 
It is useless since it is unthinking and you would awaken it. 
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and has a rest therefore. 
Say to you that if it proves to be very anxious several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to prove what causes so much anxiety at the child. 
If you understand what he says (what is not habitual), have no temptation to question it to acquire information. 
You will acquire nothing, because by sleeping, he is not aware to be able to organize his thought. 
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you will not know of what he is dreaming, of blow made attention in the manner in which you will interpret information and in conclusions which you draw. 
Never say to the child that you can question it during night to know its secrets. 
Even not by joking. 
It causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not get worried, it is nothing very malicious, it is an episode which lasts only some minutes. 
Illhaeusern finally 
Illhaeusern finally found the way of win on his ground after a long period of famine. 
Without making a big match, Yellow and Blacks created the biggest number of opportunities and succeeded in transforming one for the benefit of match.

But the kicker Illhousiens will not be able to savour his happiness for a long time and will be made to regain to cloakroom a dozen of minutes later and to leave his team mates so in numerical baseness. 
But Dannemarie will not know how to use it and pose big problems in one Eleven illhousien who just postponed a bit for "Compacter" the defence, except in the very last seconds of game where, after a big foul-up, the bullet crossed near the transverse very.

Obama, victor in the points of the first television duel 
The first debate of Friday between both candidates for the White House other one succeeded to know who, of JOHN MCCAIN or Barack Obama, took it. 
Without surprise, republican and democratic HQ of campaign proclaimed their own win in this television duel which would have been followed by a third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen thinks that the performance of JOHN MCCAIN, although honorable, was not rather "bright " to allow him to check its fall in opinion polls in five weeks of presidential elections. 
The institute Gallup Poll, an inquiry of opinion of which published on Saturday grants an advance of five points in Obama (49 % against 44 % in McCain), judges that it is the democrat who drew her pin of game. 
At the uncertain voters, who are those who count, Obama went out victor for 39 % of polling, while 25 % of them grant win in McCain, to an opinion poll CBS. 
Obama should be able to confirm her advance on Thursday with the good performance expected from his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
" It would be an error to underestimate it. 
It is has good instincts ", has defendant Bill Clinton nevertheless this weekend. 
SEPTUAGENARIAN MCCAIN had of cease putting forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the "naivety" of his adversary on these questions which were in c? ur of this first one-to-one debate. 
" The senator Obama does not seem to understand that " he accused has several resumptions. 
" I do not think that the senator Obama has necessary experience and knowledge to be president ", he also assured. 
An angle of attack beaten from yesterday in republican television advertising. 
Obama has, shone, underlined that he represented future. 
Without getting confused, it proved to be concise and definite. 
It put forward its capacity to make good decisions, and to restore the picture of the United States in the world. 
" McCain still did not understand, while Obama, yes ", retorted, this weekend, a democratic blip reproaching the republican for not having taken all measure of the impact of crisis on ' " American of the street ". 
" During ninety minutes of debate, JOHN MCCAIN had many things to say anything on me, but on you, reported Obama, yesterday, in front of 20 000 personnesrassembl�es for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a brand rain. 
He even did not pronounce words " medium class " or "workers". " Financial crushing defeat favours apparently Obama, which is considered by the Americans as most in even to save economy at the edge of precipice. 
" The week to come could be a decisive turn ", estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an ancient of the administration Clinton, compared " good economic instincts " of Obama with those of the Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate, the actual d�bacle " is the final verdict of eight years of a poor economic policy put there? uvre by George Bush and supported by SENATOR MCCAIN ". 
Reasserting that it would all the same manage to reduce the levies of 95 % of the Americans in spite of the starts of Wall Street, the senator of Illinois also signalled that the realization of a possible energy independence of the country by the promotion of renewable energy sources was its first preference, with the installation of a system of insurance-health.

In Minsk, " you pointed out that there was an election, you? " 
Young persons and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening on the main place of the Byelorussian capital to reject beforehand the results of general elections. 
Some hundred of Byelorussians met on Sunday evening from the closing of polling stations on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of general elections. 
While no result had again been announced, numerous young persons had come to demonstrate against the power of the president Alexander Loukachenko: " the dictator, resignation ". 
Some people even confess not to have voted: " What's the point, since they will make what they want in my voice ", says a young person. 
They do not think that the regime which made good face to the foreign watchers with the intention of taking back language with the European Union is ready to perform a democratic turn. 
Sanctions, which the ban of visas for 40 Byelorussian leaders and the frost of certain assets, could be raised if these elections were considered as clean by the watchers. 
They were not her according to opposition. 
" We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our watchers could not participate in study ", deplored Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of democratic Force, heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties. 
" It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexander Milinkievitch, the ancient candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of proEuropean movement, because importing it it is which count voices, and at our place, it is the executive power. 
If deputies of opposition enter the Parliament, it is because they will have been named, not elected. 
But their entrance in the Parliament can mean of the space on television, of meetings in regions and of proposals of laws. " 
Opposition has to therefore to enter political game because " it is necessary to start dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily put into debt in relation to Russia, enters in crisis, and that we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
And we want to be independent ". 
Opposition fears that the Organization for security and collaboration in Europe which followed the electoral process acknowledges the validity of polls. 
She underlines that the figures of participation seem too well brought up, and that the general implementation of advance vote (26 % of the voters in Minsk) opened voice to all manipulations. 
" You pointed out that there was an election, you? the social-democrat leader Alexander Kozouline, one of both political prisoner last liberated in August of this year questions. 
There was nobody in polling stations. 
And there will be at the farthest five deputies of the opposition to the Parliament, those who are the best suitable for power. " 
Night silence falls again on the October place. 
On television, the president Loukachenko and the members of the electoral central commission are very pleased about their success. 
Meeting - Some blood become again sure 
H�ma-Qu�bec celebrated the 10th birthday of his foundation, and his chairwoman, the Dre Francine D�cary yesterday, had every reason to be delighted, because H�ma-Qu�bec became one of the securitiest and most efficient purveyors of blood of the world. 
And especially, it recovered the trust of the public which had been seriously shaken by the scandal of the blood polluted in 1980 and on 1990. 
As is well known, the national reservations of blood managed by the Service of blood transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross were polluted by the virus of the acquired acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and the virus of hepatitis C during 1980s. 
In front of this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada instituted in Februar,y 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace Krever, an inquiry which aimed at bringing the truth about circumstances having driven to such tragedy and formulating recommendations so that such cataclysm does not reproduce any more. 
While the judge Krever deferred depositing his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee having as objective to plan a new management system of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the G�lineau committee filled this mandate. 
Following reports G�lineau and Krever, two purveyors were created in Canada: H�ma-Qu�bec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all other provinces and both territories. 
" In 1998, when H�ma-Qu�bec began the activities, barely 38 % of people still trusted in the system of blood in Quebec, reminds Dre D�cary. 
Situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to ameliorate the security of the blood products and job on the ground during the years which followed, we regained to the trust of the public ", she says before maintaining proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 % of the population of Quebec consequently trusted in H�ma-Qu�bec. 
Dre D�cary keeps nevertheless at the head that " trust is something extremely fragile ". 
From the creation, on September 28th, 1998, H�ma-Qu�bec applied the principle of circumspection. 
In this epoch, they attended in Europe the hatching of numerous cases of the human form of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tells the one who holds the fort since its foundation in 1998. 
" And we knew in no way if this illness could be passed on by blood. 
They belong then supported on one of the main recommendations of relationship Krever and G�lineau, according to which when they do not know it and that a serious illness can follow from it, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob which is characterized by a degeneration of the cerebrum leading inevitably to death, they institute measurements of exclusion. 
In April, 1999, they therefore refused the blood of the persons who had stayed more than a month in United Kingdom since 1980. 
And, some years ago, it was shown out of any doubt that this illness is passed on by blood. 
This episode so showed us that the principle of circumspection which they applied had sense. " 
In 1999 a much more sensitive technology of screening of the HIV appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) which allow to discern directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the very virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on that rested tests used until then. 
TAN allowed to get shorter the dumb period, which stretches between the instant when the person was infected and that where the first viruses can be discerned in blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
They could reduce this period to a lower length in week. 
They so diminished risk considerably as certain donors are infected without knowing it and as they cannot discern them. 
These improvements allowed to lower considerably the risk of contracting the AIDS by a blood blood transfusion. 
Today, a person on 12 millions runs the risk of accepting some blood polluted by the HIV. 
" In other words, it means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood products before somebody is infected by the HIV. 
As H�ma-Qu�bec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before happens a case of transmission of the HIV by a blood product. 
I think that they can feel today comfortable to accept or to prescribe a blood blood transfusion to recuperate health ", asserts leader of the direction of H�ma-Qu�bec. 
" Our challenge for next decade is to support the security of our products. 
They never know which pathogenic is going to appear in the system. 
Not later only last year the virus Chikungunya appeared on the island of Meeting which, following the example of the virus of western Nile, is transmitted by an insect in blood. 
It is necessary to be always vigilant ", follows Dre D�cary before underlining that besides a security supply, H�ma-Qu�bec must also envisage a sufficient supply. 
" Needs augment because the population gets old. 
The anticancerous treatments being more aggressive, the patients often need a reload in red cells or in bars. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences to the network of the blood donors which regroups on average only 3 % of the acceptable Natives of Quebec in the donation of blood. " 
Every person in health, of 18 and more years old meeting the requirements of admissibility can however give some blood every 56 days, is six times per year. 
On average, 14 % of the persons who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are attained of the AIDS or malaria, for instance, and if they travelled in a country where clamps down the paludism, they will be excluded during a period of one year. 
" With this 3 %, we succeed in supporting an inventory which meets needs of hospitals. 
Scarceness is very rare. 
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they get old and cannot give any more of their blood. 
And it is difficult to persuade people to give of their blood, but especially to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donor. 
Today's life being so unbridled, they seldom find the time to spend one hour to be given of its blood ", is upset Francine D�cary. 
With an annual 297 million dollar budget, H�ma-Qu�bec provides not only blood products, but also human cloths, among which bony grafts, cardiac valves, oculomotor globes and skin which is almost exclusively used for the third degree burns victims. 
These cloths are analysed, transformed and frozen be stored before to H�ma-Qu�bec which also manages the only public bank of blood of cord in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord which was considered in the past to be a biomedical waste product is packed in a blood rich in strain cells that can serve for treating serious illnesses, such as leukemia. 
" They celebrated, some weeks ago, the bet in bank of our thousandth sample of blood of cord and they plan take a sample of more than one thousand per year. 
They should begin offering it for offices of the Clerk of the Court at the beginning of the next year ", specify Dre D�cary which represents this program of sample of blood of cord as very popular. 
" Several mums are disappointed not to can have access there ", because H�ma-Qu�bec has no means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - Impact in semifinal

It had a nice applause. " 
Charest bets on the North 
The prime minister does not exclude to trigger off elections before the end of the year 
After the general advice of the ended liberal Party, Jean Charest went in Jean-Talon, to Quebec yesterday, where the new minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (to the left), tries to make elect on the occasion of today's bye-election. 
" Push back the borders of our last big border of the north ": such is the long-term ambition which Jean Charest introduced with force person with a strong visual sense while staying in outlines, at the end of the general advice of the liberal Party of Quebec, in L�vis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, been cast a kind of Mill with pictures. 
Spectacular plates of hydroelectric dams, mining development, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", cards turned in a continuous loop, on three huge screens, etc. 
Big means as in electoral period. 
In no press, besides, the prime minister refused to exclude that he would trigger off elections this autumn, even if he pointed out that his timetable was very charged. 
" North Plan " the fourth section of a "vision " is which the prime minister pretends to have as Quebec, that of a " new economic space ", which consists of an understanding on the work force with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and understanding with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in speeches of the prime minister newly, the opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation. 
The prime minister nevertheless contented himself with explaining why the North was " a jewel in huge potential ", but did not give expiry date, sums of investment, nor definite preference in plans to come. 
At the very most some avenues of what could be more developed: notably hydroelectricity, forest, but especially mining area, doped by the growth of the emergent countries and the reconstruction of public facilities. 
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, and, silver, iron, titanium, and the same diamond ", according to the listing of Mr Charest. 
This " territory twice big as France ", " it is at home, it is in Quebec. 
Not only it is at our place, but it is in us ", it insisted, as if to show well that he solicited a national founder myth. 
Quebec was built a lot in its relation with the North, he underlined: rush towards gold in Abitibi, engineering of Quebec, the Berry James. 
" It belongs to us, it is our future ", he added, having made a theatric pause to consider the huge card behind him. 
The North, 70 % of the territory of Quebec, consists of a scoop of Labrador that Quebec always demanded, specified the prime minister during no press. 
" It is a traditional position which all governments iterated. 
There is a line of border on which there is not understanding since for a long time and, when opportunity comes, I iterate this position in the name of the government ", he pointed out. 
Besides, " with climatic changes, it is necessary to to re-think of our vision of the North ", he declared by speaking about the passage of the northwest, which will open all year long owing to the cast iron of ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister thinks that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and Inuits? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to their respect and that plan would be of benefit to them, notably to the young persons. 
Ancient two ministers coming from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L�tourneau (former member p�quiste of Ungava), have already started consultations to around thirty communities. 
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Beno�t Pelletier and in who Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural resources) has an important place started jobs. 
The prime minister excludes a big meeting, " not necessarily a summit ", but an instant when " they will give a common vision ". 
The development of the North would be made besides in compliance with the principles of lasting development. 
North Plan " will will been planed, ordered and respectful of environment ", he promised. 
Jean Charest represented this "vision " as being in continuity with that of prime minister liberal which preceded it. 
" As the Liberals who preceded us, we thought in another way to transform challenges into new opportunities of growth and development. " 
It was besides one of the recurrent topics of the weekend, which started on Friday by a big cocktail to underline the 50th birthday of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions offers to rechristen the Power station Beauharnois in Dam Ad�lard-Godbout. 
" About Godbout, which created Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage which made quiet Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa which made the Berry James, our party knew how to forge future ", declared Jean Charest. 
In no press, it invoked another reference, conservative that one, programs "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 till 1963. 
By approaching the plan of hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest underlined that his bringing into service was envisaged for 2012. 
" This stays between us there, but I plan be there ", it entrusted to his activists, provoking nourished clapping at home. 
In effect, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be election in 2008 and undoubtedly not in 2009, did not move aside the possibility of triggering off polls this autumn, what law allows him. 
He underlines that his timetable is nevertheless filled, notably by a mission of the advice of the confederation in China and a summit Quebec-@ York. 
The general Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader a platform containing nationalist resolutions, notably " constitutional aspirations " which are crossed as a letter in post office: PLQ claims recognition particularly the " peculiarity of Quebec " in Constitution. 
He also wishes that Quebec names members of the Council of broadcasting and Canadian telecommunications and that these last have the right of veto on decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of opposition, they received the outlines of North Plan with scepticism. 
P�quiste leader, Pauline Marois, took out again the Policy of development of Nord-du-Qu�bec which the Landry government had thrown in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, by coming to power in 2003, abandoned the idea of applying it. 
If it had made it, " they would be more advanced today " comments on Mrs Marois beside her candidate in Jean-Talon (polls which takes place today), Fran�oise Mercure. 
ADQ told support the adoption of a North Plan by the government. 
" But what they wish, it is that this is not just a show ", commented the leader Sebastian Proulx, in return for of Mario Dumont, who comes back from vacation today. 
Letters - A dishonored country 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former prime minister of "Justice" (� irony) in the office Harper, who afforded last summer to say about Louise Arbour that it was a "shame" for Canada. 
Throw opprobrium so on this woman who led an uninterrupted battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration as say a lot there on the circle of the prime minister as on very Stephen Harper. 
We here is in front of a government which is the only one, among all implicated western countries, not to have repatriated his national locked up in the concentration camp of Guant�namo. 
A government which takes into account not at all due to the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts one reproach for that him. 
The only government which, in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Convention of Geneva, disavow its word and lets stagnate a child-soldier in inhuman conditions. 
The only one who recovers from it in a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the defendant. 
Let us say, from memory, that the UNICEF, international Amnesty and the Association of the Canadian Rung, notably, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it benefits from an equitable trial in Canada. 
It is the same government which closes eyes on torment: few imports him that a young adult is destroyed consequently psychologically, undoubtedly for ever after so many years of acts of violence. 
They still do not realize it, but we assist in insidious one erosion of our rights, our freedom and at present our "democracy", this word which Harper does not stop throwing out and that rings so hollow in its mouth. 
Here is come the time when no morality exists more: they can manhandle, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen arbitrarily according to the good will of a heretofore minority head of government (that it will be therefore after October 14th). 
Number of voters thinks that they will find greeting in a party which advocates Virtuousness, Law and Order: they do not see that this government abandoned what made reputation and respectability of our country. 
Shame, Mr Toews, her is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The orwellien speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of September 17th, Duty published a letter of Mr Patrick J . Garver, guiding vice-president of mining sheepskin-lined jacket Barrick Gold. 
Following a logic orwellienne, this one maintains that the biggest auriferous company of the world has intent� a chase in defamation of six millions against three authors and a small publishing company without the penny with the intention of throwing a " transparent public debate ". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and uncommitted, it is not the truth which they judge, especially in the case of chases in defamation, but law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is absolutely eclipsed by Mr Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best manner of leading a public debate be to lead to the decline whoever dares to support a position opposite to his? 
It doesn't much matter the exit of trial, the authors and the editor of the Black book Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to struggle, in very unequal weapon, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining. 
The tactics, in these unequal conflicts, often is besides to ruin the respondents to impose an amicable settlement which will gag opposition besides scaring whoever will dare to lean again over question. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that it should have introduced its vision of facts. 
Contrary to what is made in some of the countries where works Barrick Gold, debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not in blows of nightstick. 
It was therefore enough for the mining to open its pounds, to draw up its files and to establish a true debate, across newspapers, mass media, publications and financing of independent research teams which would have been able to bring the truth about question. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in public opinion and rejects petitions of the back of the hand and letters of support of the authors of Black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can ask at the same time for a "public" debate while despising the opinions of the same public? 
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word indicates only the lavishly paid lawyers and not all the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of concept. 
In democracy, even the detractors have the right to word. 
What what does not consist of - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, it is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Black Canada fact first of all because he rejects the violent way of the mining. 
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what several people receive as a chase-gag (following " public debate ", Barrick Gold has besides just deposited a demand towards the authors of Black Canada their intimant to stop the use of this term). 
Beyond the surr�el speech of Mr Garver, the chase of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of university research and the search of the truth, essential in any democratic society. 
It disclaims, outright, the right to the quotation of credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the foundation of brainwork. 
If it is impossible to be studying and to discuss subjects which dissatisfy the rich firms of this world in a country as Canada, on pain of chases with repetition, which will be able to make it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could make it following the scientific norms used by the authors of Black Canada. 
It has the right of retort. 
The university middle, to which we belong, knows for a long time how to manage debates and disagreement and to solve conflicts. 
The immoderate chase of Barrick Gold shows apparently that, contrary to what she pretends, she does not feel like a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, everything as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments set up implements restricting this type of excessive chases. 
Operation of rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, at the same time republicans and democrats, finally reached an agreement on the biggest plan of economic rescue since the Big Depression yesterday of the thirties. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion American dollars aiming at slowing down the financial crisis which shakes Wall Street for months must again be ratified by both rooms of the Congress. 
She notably envisages: a better control by the elected representatives of his applying, new mechanisms aiming at assuring the refund of the hired public funds, of new dispositions to contain the number of houses grabbed for default in payment, as well as a right of inspection on wages poured to the leaders of the helped firms. 
The American secretary in the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the chairwoman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative at the table of negotiations, the senator Judd Gregg, announced good news some minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
" We accomplished big progress with the aim of an understanding which will be efficient on markets ", declared the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
" Everything was made so as to put in the shelter the real economy and the American common places of ongoing crisis in Wall Street ", explained the democrat. 
" It is the fundamental point: if we do not make it, traumatism, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of the Americans will be huge ", declared the republican Judd Gregg. 
Negotiations had turned in the sprint in last hours by fear of the effect which would cause a new failure on the mood of the investors. 
The hour restricts that they had agreed the opening of markets this morning was. 
Having linked to negotiations late, both candidates for American presidential election proved to be rather favourable to understanding, without almost express however their discontent that they are obliged to arrive at this end there. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama took the addition of certain dispositions in understanding, notably that aiming at allowing to the owners to keep their domicile and that on the wage of the leaders of the surviving firms by the State. 
" When they ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to be very pleased. 
But these measurements are necessary ", he commented on the waves of American television. 
Questioned about another chain to know if it would vote for offered plan, his republican adversary, JOHN MCCAIN, answered: " I would like to see details, but I hope that yes. " 
" The outlines which I read [show] that it is something that we all are going to have to digest and with that we are going to be able to advance. 
Option to make nothing is not simply allowable ", he said. 
The plan of 700 billions aims at buying back bad debts with the silver of the taxpayers, assets at risks and unsalable of the American financial institutions. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis triggered off by the blasting of a property bubble which first led to the collapse of mortgage credits at risk (subprimes) before stretching in other forms more spread by titles of credit (PCAA) and resulting in a frost of liquid assets and in the stampede of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of republican elected representatives that had made capsize the first plan of understanding, last week. 
They believe have gone out of this dead end since the democrats accepted that certain active "toxins" of companies in trouble are only assured by the government, rather than bought. 
To round up angles for everybody in the Congress, they as added a stipulating disposition as if the government had to take losses during five years with this program, he could set up new taxes aiming at helping it to recover his bet. 
New plan envisages the remittance of a first edge of 250 billions to which will be able to be added 100 other billions if the president the necessary judge. 
The remittance of 350 other billions should be ratified by another vote of the Congress. 
In exchange for its help, Washington will acquire participations in the helped firms which will be worth him dividends in case of benefit and that he will be able to sell retail when the torment will be crossed. 
The federal government will have the possibility of postponing the procedures of seizures concerning accommodation tied to the property loans concerned by this plan, as well as to fix borders to remuneration and to indemnification of departure poured to the leaders of the affected firms. 
The architects of plan would like to see it subjected to the vote of the House of Representatives from today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts, it is still not sure that their plan will have green light. 
Voices continued in effect rising against this plan, both in the republican camp and democrat yesterday. 
" Obviously, Washington does not hear you ", declared at his voters the republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of finances of the Chamber. 
" Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are resolutions. 
But not the one who consists in using taxpayers ". 
Animator of the small group in the Congress nicknamed " the caucus of the sceptics ", the democratic representative Brad Sherman present things in another way, but arrives at the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred distinguished professors of economy, whom three Nobel prizes, wrote us to say to us: they ask the Congress not to hurry up and to examine attentively the way to take ", he declared yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, they had once again the proof of the worldwide nature of crisis. 
At the end of urgent meeting, the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11,2 billion euro (16,3 billions US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, from Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French BNP Paribas bank informed that it abandoned the idea of acquiring his rival in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euro (2,9 billions US) in the crisis of the property loans at risk in the United States. 
Fortis uses 85 000 persons and is part of twenty bigger European banks and of ten bigger underwriters. 
" It is not some lost silver, declared yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, they recover a right to vote in the bank and of influence. 
It is precisely something that the savers and household appreciate now that time promises to be uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the Sleeve, the British government seemed in process of nationalizing another bank manhandled by financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take back in its count all the ongoing loans to the bank Bradford and Bringley, among which more than 41 billions (75,5 billions US) property loans. 
The Spanish Santander bank informed yesterday that it is it who would buy subsidiaries and count customers of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Died from a hired icon 
His beauty with the eyes of azure has been its card trump for a long time, some people will say his weakness. 
Had it freed himself from the narcissique mirror, the American actor with smile charmer? 
Yes and not. 
Its virtuousness, its feelings and a talent which ran from source will have also moved it away from the register of potency which gives birth to the true sacred monsters. 
But what a big long-distance runner! 
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, in 83 years, from suites of a lung cancer in its ranch of Connecticut, residence one of the last icons of the American cinema of the auspicious years. 
Less monumental than Brando, whom it resembled and of whom he has been a kind of rival in the screen, more careful in his game, indeed more fragile for a long time, but apostle also of freedom and blasting of dramatic conventions. 
Blended blood often makes magnificent children. 
It is born in Ohio in 1925, of a German jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin. 
These European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without ultimate, immoderate ego mark with quality. 
Because in him cast whole country being in love with of the self made man, the combatant of the war of Pacific, hurt in battle, which at the beginning of the fifties studied drama in Yale then saw frequently Actor' s Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theatre, in television, soon in the cinema. 
The same man who campaigned for civil rights the motorized pilot was also who ranked second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, double of a sex symbol, though member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
The zones of shade of this allergic, hired, secret, discreet star in brightness of the show business also disappear with him, mystery of which they will not completely have pierced. 
A honest man, in the most noble sense of term. 
The disappearing of Paul Newman brought vertigo to the cinema enthusiasts this weekend, while its big roles on the black screen of memories clink. 
More than half a century of an American cinematographic art in perpetual mutation marches across him. 
Come back bump into each other in memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the rejecting young man his sensual marries (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Female cat on a burning roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), they recall his sensitive mister Bridge, flustered in his old age by a marriage which did not fill all its promises. 
So many others Paul Newman are crossed to history. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by hate), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken back after his death, who really threw Newman in 1956. 
This nice criminal in the brillantissime The Sting (The Swindle), Oscar of the best film in 1973. 
Player of bitter and vengeful billiards in the magnificent The Hustler de Robert Rossen (1961), it will take back the figure on return in The Color of Money de Martin Scorsese, which was worth him in 1987 his only Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face across ages, it was it. 
Still it. 
Epochs bump into each other across his course. 
The young persons know it especially across the cultissime Slap Shot de George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of unorthodox ice ice hockey. 
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With sponsor's last role of the Irish mafia in Road to Iniquity of Sam Mendes in 2003, the curl was fastened. 
Contrary to several legends of the cinema which dropped enough job early, Newman will have resided in saddle for a long time, while reporting Hollywood, the gold, the pomps and the concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand taverner considered it, not without humour, " as a challenge living in " the underplaying " judging his too much supported benefits. 
Occupation was not always loving for nice Paul Newman to whom roles have fallen very cooked in the beak for a long time. 
He played however less often the first young persons than the marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate persons, whose drift and uprisings his perfect traits reflected. 
As film director, Newman revealed facets badly known by the true modest feelings. 
He Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his spouse Joanne Woodward in title role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholia. 
Shone who lost his son Scott by overdose devoted him his film Harry and Sound in 1984, work of virtuousness and sadness. 
Among the rain of respects which erupted on Newman yesterday, his big mate and ancient comrade-in - arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) asserted, very saddened: " His presence returned my life and it better countries. " 
Generosity, love of existence vibrating traits of the missing actor are. 
Beyond the career of legend, also fades a big activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an anti-authority of the drift of Hollywood. 
They will have a lot seen his face sitting enthroned on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other food, judging the technique of rather poor taste, though gag at first. 
Benefits of these sales were however poured in his Foundation for childhood in trouble. 
Newman, rather than to sit down on the myth, will have got involved until the end. 
It left to his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: " Always and till the end, your father was terrifically thankful of his good star. 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of a so generous and so clear American artist. 
Citizen models, all in all and extra. 
That can definitely fabricate Zuschlag? Company in their plant with bills? 
Shortly, on October 8th, be going to start audiences relating to ongoing criminal procedure, against J�nos Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in form of criminal organization, permanently and regular, having entrain� of particularly important damage. Other counts of indictment were kept against them, as for instance, falsehood and use of forged documents. 
According to the Office of Public Prosecutor, the silver coming from subventions, was spent for personal aims, while benefits were justified by wrong bills. 
The silver of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on one hand to the cases of movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of certain persons. 
Their method, made public also by authorities loaded with the inquiry, was to touch the silver of acquired subventions by issuing bills of expenses, behind which no real performance was provided and so, associations have never respected their commitments. 
According to the bill of indictment, a big party of bills being wrong. 
For these last, they obtained books of bills in the market of J�zsefv�ros, while they fabricated cachets in Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of societies which were going to appear on bills, one decided on it, between others, in the course of tours in province from the north of the lake Balaton, performed by Istv�n Lados, at the request of J�nos Zuschlag. 
According to the deposition of this last, he had to spot pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked for a bill, like which they accomplished other bills which they were going to introduce, between others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, ministry of social affairs and job, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to achieve subventions. 
The majority of the bills were created by Istv�n Lados and by his accomplice Andr�s? laughed, which according to our information, tried especially to write files necessary for the getting of subventions. 
During a " circuit of location ", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro. 
According to both bills issued by Zuschlag in 2003, this place assured the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes�let. 
However, according to the purposes of the manager, it would have been impossible that so many persons occupy this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in summer of year 2002, bill established in the name of foundation Jobb J�v? �rt, which later will carry the name of Egy�tt has Harmadik �vezred�rt, swarms about with errors of forms and bottom. 
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in reality only three rooms, and maximum ten persons could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned hundred and thirty customers. 
The transmitters of bills in exuberant imagination also fell in excess, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft society, also belonging to the area Horeca. In their accountancy, or the name of Jobb J�v? �rt, nor that of Hopp� appeared, according to information given to the Office of Public Prosecutor. 
Gy? z? Farkas, the manager of the society, declared in the hvg.hu site that when the Office of Public Prosecutor called it and was shining shows bills, he knew, right away, that it was about wrong documents. 
" The name of our society and our number of tax being put in a poor place on the cachet. " 
He added: " Beyond form, fact that according to the bill, hundred persons live there, did not stick either, since this establishment counts only eleven rooms, without so much place. 
Besides, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is since closed a very long time ago. " 
The zealous transmitters of bills either did not enquire about the agencies of trips of Budapest, being part of their choice, but organizing only trips abroad. So, naively, they pointed out stays in Hungary on bills to be regulated in cash, what also goes contrary to the accounting practices of the agency. 
Of surcroit, as it appeared during the inquiry, they also added VAT on these documents, while benefits concerning the activities of trips, destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT. 
Also, the rate of VAT of the four bills established in the name of the Hotel R�vf�l�p in the order of Jobb J�v? �rt been wrong, since the benefits of the society do not support one 25 % VAT as stated, but one 15 % VAT. Besides, the employees of the hotel issue only printed bills, while the wrong were written in the hand. 
The inquiry of the Office of Public Prosecutor reveals that "transmitters" also made errors by mentioning the transport of goods as performance by road, that the broadcasting society of bills could practise, seen only its contour was advice in investment. 
Besides, it is also for vices of forms, as types of inadequate bills and the wrong cachets, that bills issued in the order of Egy�tt has Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny, of XXI. Sz�zadi Kultur�lis Egyes�let and of Biztos Pont turned out to be wrong. 
Very as in the case of the society Ravenna Bt. or of the sports training period of Kunfeh�rt �, which very two disclaim being the authors of bills issued in their name. 
The forgers either did not pay attention to the fact than the HIB Kft . society, established in Ny�regyh�za, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V�ros�rt Egyes�let was being supposed to do take a meal to them. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the society disclaims having issued this bill. 
Bills established intentionally 
Another category of transmitters of bills that is composed of those who were completely aware that one asked for it them to issue fictitious bills. 
The Es�ly Budapest�rt Alap�tv�ny foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj � Szocialist�k, established a bill in the order of foundation Egy�tt has Harmadik �vezred�rt, for a sum of four million HUF. 
According to the bill of indictment, the manager of the society Collab Kft. was led to issue wrong bills by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy�rfi. 
Also, the Biogate Kft . society collaborated with Zuschlags, who is under liquidation nowadays and who in 2003, issues bills in the order of foundation Jobb J�v? �rt Alap�tv�ny, from the association Atlasz Egyes�let and the V�r�sfeny association? Egyes�let, for a sum about five million HUF, but behind which no performance was really provided. 
No financial movement took place, either, saw only the issued bills were later cancelled, but it, organisms avoided well mentioning it in their accountancy. 
The following category of broadcasting societies of bills is that of the societies directly linked to the defendants. 
So, the administrative delegate of the managing director of the society Hang glider Sorting � Kft ., being in charge of the trade of combustible and of motorized vehicles, the head office of which was in Budapest, but where it was there untraceable, was Iv�n Kubatov. 
In October, November and December, 2005, this society issued several bills concerning the sale of computer equipment, for a sum about 18 million HUF. 
According to the inquiry, this equipment would have been bought by the society Cash Investment Kft de Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since September 14th, 2005. 
The manager of this society was a man of Romanian origin, who Iv�n Kubatov would have also forwarded documents in touch with the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the inquiry that he issued bills in the order of societies Atlasz, Hopp� and Egy�tt has Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny, and that he pocketed their exchange value. 
It is precisely at the request of Iv�n Kubatov that Romanian bricklayers created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft societies and Jos-Investment Bt. 
In reality, none of these societies what did not work, what the defendant explains due to the fact that they did not accept job. 
It used these societies all the same, since at the request of master Zsolt Szente, codefendant as well as editor of the acts of foundation of societies, he established bills in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, as associations Atlasz et Y-Gener�ci �. 
Kubatov gave in organisms, 15 bills in total, issued by societies Cash Investment, Hang glider Sorting �, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The Office of Public Prosecutor thought that 10 % of sums pointed out on bills as well as VAT went to the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt society. to establish fictitious bills which were used as part of the request of subvention of Biztos Pont. 
In January, 2006, the Y-Gener�ci association � and Sz�vets�g has Modern Magyarorsz�g�rt introduces a request of subvention to the organism of public utility of the socialist party, T�ncsics Mih�ly Alap�tv�ny (TMA). 
They acquired this subvention for a sum of two times 500.000 HUF, but these sums were not used for objectives pointed out in request. 
To avoid that it does not know, five fictitious bills accepted from the society Works Team Kft were introduced in TMA. 
Besides, it is these bills which were found during the house search performed in the office d ' � rp�d Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education. 
During audience, a party of the defendants will relate the method of manufacture of bills, as it had already made it in front of the Office of Public Prosecutor before. 
What could really be interesting would be because the main defendant, J�nos Zuschlag itself, decides to raise the voile on all history. 
Until now, his admissions are not very detailed, and although he promises again and again to tell the slightest details, it has not made it yet. 
Question is to know if it is in its interest, or then, possibly, the socialists would have concluded an agreement according to which in exchange for the refund of a big party of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would carry alone the hat. 
Today, this last is probably offent, since requests for his investment under house arrest, on foundation of a lightening of its conditions of imprisonment, fall persistently in the ear of a deaf. 
While those who caused much more important damage, and the authors of not repairable economic offences, go for a walk freely or at least, waits in their own domicile for the end of procedure. He does not have this possibility. 
The psychology of the higher bid: why do they spend more silver? 
During auctions, the purchasers have tendency to spend more, and to overrate the goods. 
The researchers in neurology and in economy of the University of New York succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this known and obviously irrational behaviour. 
According to their study published in the magazine Science, the human beings do not want to be outdistanced during this type of competition, as for instance an auction on eBay, and that's why they even prefer paying a too well brought up price. 
These researches tried to raise a neurological schema of this type of "game" with the aid of experimental auctions. 
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, while the other group took part in a play auction, while with the aid of a technique of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), the researchers analysed the active cerebral domains of experimental subjects. 
In both games, the participants could earn some silver, but during the auction an essential element of which is the higher bid of a third, the group being under the cerebral trunk, called striatum, put on in movement in a intensive manner during the loss of the party. 
This party of the cerebrum, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism ' "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That's why, according to the researchers, the rise of prices explains with escape in front of the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In support of their theories, the members economists of this group of researchers followed analyses of financial surveillance. 
During these, three groups overbid faced with a partner, in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the group control of the real value of the product being discussed, and they so performs their bet. 
In another group, they promised that if, on top of that, they went out winning of the party, then they would accept 15 additional dollars, in reward. 
While the third group shone accepted these 15 dollars before auction, but the members of the group also lost this silver, in case they lost auction. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was put at the one on win, while to other one, on failure. 
By proving so the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team of the players " against failure " being willing in more well brought up bets than those performed by the group control and put together it " for win ". 
" These results can be shown by no already existent economic theory. 
In effect, each of them explained phenomena determined during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and parade in front of risk. 
Alone the methods of neurological imagery helped to abolish polarity between both theories by coming out, by supporting, on a third explanation. " - determined Andrew Schotter, the professor of the faculty of the economics of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when must we consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion persons endures columns from hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic illness of the liver is mentioned among the first reasons of decease. 
They estimate at one hundred milles the ill holders of the virus of hepatitis in Hungary, but alone seven milles follow a treatment. It is of in the fact that often the sick do not know that they are bearing of the virus. 
Name hepatitis is a generic name given in infections touching the liver and talked by different viruses. 
There are a lot of similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and turns yellow it the pathogenic agents and procreated diseases is characteristic, but postpone some of the others them. 
The viruses of hepatitis, according to pathogenic genes, spread in most cases under two forms: hepatitises A and E across the digestive tube (for instance: food or water polluted), hepatitises B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (semen, vaginal secretion, salivates). 
For the passengers, it is in any case recommended to make vaccinate against viruses A and B. There is not vaccine against C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear, accompanied with a poor general state, with weakness, with wrong of stomach and nausea two-three weeks after the consumption of polluted food, in general. 
Then develop on the skin and on the white of l '? it one goes yellow visible, saddles become more clear and urine takes a more dark colour. Healing can take two-three weeks. 
Across the world, every year, a million persons dies from the most serious form of this pathology, as the cancer or the cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
Main reason is there that according to estimates, alone a sick man on ten accepts a medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, she can lead to a cirrhosis or a cancer of the liver. 
The most part of the sick do not know attained by the virus, because pathogenic gene destroys the cells of the liver in a sly manner. In a lot of cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 - 30 years. 
As a result, a precocious prevention is very important, as well as regular tests of screening. 
Pollution is much more well brought up than average among a population of three groups: the persons having been subjected to a blood blood transfusion before 1991, the consumers of narcotics and the tattooing. 
Nowadays, they estimate in 200 millions the sick attained by a chronic hepatitis of type C in the world. 
Since illness can be discerned by an exam of routine in laboratory, it is recommended to consult his doctor dealing from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
Illness can be cured, if it is discerned on time. The virus can be eradicated by organism, in that way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is told. 
September 30th is the worldwide day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organisms representing the sick of the four corners of the world. 
His objective is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, on reasons of its development and on importance of the precocious diagnosis of illness. 
The one who grows in God does it feel pain less? 
According to the results of the recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to return more tolerable the death of the Catholic martyrs. 
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers of the University of Oxford accomplished an interesting experience by analysing at which level the belief in God could influence tolerance in the pain of the human being. 
As part of this at least strange experience, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshock therapy, while each of them noticed a painting representing the virgin Mary. 
According to results, the Catholic believers were able of excluding a big party of suffering. 
Thanks to a technology of palpation of the human cerebrum, they could also discover that the Catholics were able of speeding up the party of their cerebrum responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This analysis is the first one of a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different areas of the university. 
More precisely, experience takes place in the following way: an instrument issuing sparks and broadcasting electroshock therapy is fixed on the left hand of experimental subject. 
The researchers asked the participants of experience to look of a supported manner at two painting, at the one being the virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in 17th century and other one, the Lady in the stoat painted by Leonard de Vinci in 15th century. 
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the virgin Mary recalls a kind of state of creed among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first one, concerned its comforting effect. 
Experimental subjects crossed half an hour in a scanner IRM, and during this time, accepted 20 electroshock therapy in four party succeeding one another, while looking either at painting with religious topic, that is that in more general topic. 
The Catholics declared that at the sight of the virgin Mary, they felt as " in security ", as somebody of whom they "look after" and they " calmed down, and peace pervaded it ". 
At the sight of the painting of religious themes, they gave an account of 12 % of pain in less than when they looked l '? uvre of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took himself leaves to experience, thinks that they can attain the same effects with any other strong picture, at the atheists, on the condition of finding the appropriate photograph. 
" We should find a picture facing which they react very positively, as for instance a mother or a father ", declared the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, greeted the results of these researches. 
" The practice of creed should change and in a lot of cases, really change our personality ", added Wright. 
After these very good results, there remains only the question of knowledge what would be effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if they show to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre? 
Would the view of a virgin Mary of better quality cause better results? 
You are what you disclose on your subject 
On the occasion of his tenth birthday, Google maintains that they can find it in the bottom of the pocket of people in the same capacity as the sky above the head. He knows where they crossed their vacation, which specialists they consult and which are their centres of interest. 
It is however not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential persons of the society. 
While as regards the sceptics establishing a parallel with the vision of terror of Orwell, these precisely do not see the bulk of the web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt declared, there is not much, in Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather some more information on his users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their initial objective which rang as follows: " Let us gather in a system all information of the world! ". 
According to the leader of questioned Google, after ten years of a job of worldwide shake-up, they still are only at the beginning of their objectives to be able to treat all information. 
In question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like that Google can answer questions as " What could I make tomorrow? " or " What is the job which would go to me the best? ". However, software will be able to answer this type of question, simple at first glance, only when they will know about it enough on the users. 
It is not perfectly clear for all internauts that words used during researches on Internet, IP address of the computer which throws research and pages consulted then by the interested persons are precisely listed. 
Through program thrown Personalized Search two years ago, the users can, for instance, stock their own research review and can consult what they searched, on that they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program being based on the same logic, will be capable of giving much more personified answers, and subject us of products and of services on foundation of our previous statements and of our recorded priorities. 
What happens if somebody uses my data against me, if he looks what is my job? ask the users, who get worried seeing the monopoly of information of Google. 
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society which can provoke fright, and it is not re-bite it, the fright of the punishment, the wish of freedom or possibly uprising counters the power which can provoke at the internaut's one against - reaction. 
It is however a confirmed fact that sought-after terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted in a third, and in this type of lawful case, nothing protects the right personnels of the internauts. 
Most blaring example of recently is probably the action coordinated against paedophile Brazilians, during who Google transmitted in the Brazilian government the information which it had harvested on the public page called Orkut, allowing an identification so. 
The internauts anxious about rights of the person could heave a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm over underneath with the organism of electronic juridical protection EFF, proves its good right to the court faced with the FBI. According to returned judgement, in future, Google will not always be able to be obliged by none of the points of constitution to disclose information at the secret request of the FBI, whatever nature it is. 
(All at once, the federal government acquired 50.000 addresses successfully some web and 1.000 research terms which it had carried off in comparison with the strengthening of law on the protection of the child, voted several years before. But when all is said and done, it does not succeed in obtaining the lists of researches of the private users, nor the whole list of Internet sites and key words of these last two months.) 
The judgement of Google is therefore rather contradictory: it is told off by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin using Google services. As a result, they attack them in the spirit of uprising which they demonstrate against the proud multinational societies of their conservative picture. 
During this time, culture American geek and her "wild children" uniting the enthusiasts, the activists and the passionate users of the computer who appear in numerous countries see in Google the next generation of the big firms, the " corporation connected up ", in contrast with its rival, Microsoft, categorized as invader of the world because of Windows, and it, even if both fight for the same objective. 
It can explain due to the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask his users of code of identification, does not ask for silver for his applications. Documentary code and packet of programs, persistently cooled, has a much more approachable, younger and more cool effect, faced with the practice of the official giant of software package. 
Reason can as be as geeks sees problematic relation very exactly between the rights of the person and Internet, and what the web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed by these last years, draws precisely behind her. 
In effect, the web 2.0 does not concern anything else than the collaboration, than makes it that we leave traces intentionally behind us, and that we use put at our disposal channels of communication, and while the dimension of these changes one after another, the bulk remains the same: they run the risk. 
A young person, in general, can hold a contour on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link up these with other benefits, as for instance with Twinter, or in last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link these up with a system of chase, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young persons can also hold blogs, in which appear automatically their most recent galleries of photographs which they stock in Flickr or in Picasa. 
While they can acquaint with numerous examples, as that of the girlfriend who understands easily at the sight of the photographs of morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his faithless friend crossed the party, or that of the society which laid one of his employees off, nothing for sincere opinions that this one wrote management on its blog regarding beep, they can be on a thing: the term of private life is completely to reconsider at present. 
The one who saw an online life, is constituted of what it shows of himself, and that's how they can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of the today's young persons. 
That wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to short-circuit the monopoly of Google, can make it (by beginning, for instance, with Scroogle, using the Google research system, but, at the same time, leaving no trace intentionally). 
The number of persons who, intentionally, do not record themselves on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not of the slightest. The services of online Google, by way of word-processing in the treatment of picture, in the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to waiters' huge parks and who do not put together our best contour, having existed until this day. 
Public opinion waits, without hiding from it really, for the instant when Google will reveal the true nature. 
The society, with its actual 156 billion dollar value, is more worth than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). Advertising domains AdWords / AdSense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while benefits introduced at a more and more important speed cause serious splitting headaches not only to Microsoft, but to other numerous creators of computer programs. 
However, the critical watchers find, next to all that, polarity having worrying effects: for instance, beep management of the society refused the protests of the employees, in its entirety, after she doubles the price of the nursery school of firm and after the society judges too expensive taken, daily numerous restoration at any time. All that seems miserable next to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced in front of the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the society discerns all results which hurt good taste, as well as the interests of Chinese regime. 
According to one of the internal rules of the society, new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on, it is that in next months and next years, they are going to make move the world on new points. While some people think that plan of scan and of archiving of pounds and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the society is quickly going to meet faced with the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble in front of his system Health, because in this one, they can construct a complete medical benefit from our previous results of analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google takes up a foundation of genetic data can give a good raw material in the next generation of authors of science fiction. The novel of famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwelliens half steps, represented the future in which a man could be approached in a astounding manner across the data of Google nothing. 
Two miners helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of �zd 
" The police called two miners to question them in the affair of the double homicide of �zd. According to justifiable suspicion, they helped to remove the traces of crime. " - declared the spokesman of the police station department of Borsod. 
The young persons acknowledged the facts one reproach for that them. At the moment, they are accused of participation. 
Both miners, who, according to the information of (Hungarian MTI Telegraph Agency) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The participation of murder can entrainer a bet in imprisonment that can go until 5 years. 
The suspect of the double homicide of �zd, a young man of the 23-year-old corner, was put in custody, on Sunday. 
Counts of indictment kept against him are numerous homicide, made with premeditation and by interest. 
During the inquiry, it showed himself that the 23-year-old young man owed a big sum of silver to a 53-year-old man. 
The suspect did not want to regulate his debt and it is for this reason that he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site of �zd where he killed it, as well as the small daughter of this man, 9-year-old. 
According to the information of MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which it was going to make its crimes hidden on scenes of the murder is proof. 
The police examines the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The grant of Warsaw makes a proposal for the redemption of the grant of Prague 
Stock exchange of Warsaw offered two hundred million euro, about five billion Czech crowns, for the redemption of 100 % of the packet of actions of stock exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of stock exchange of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal which Polish made even though, before, Czech excludes the grant of Warsaw of the circle of the new potential owners of the grant of Prague. 
The reason of this exclusion is that the grant of Warsaw is in the hands of the State. 
99 % of actions are in the hands of the Polish State which wants to part from more than 60 % of his actions in some months of activities. 
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Polish represents the most well brought up offer which is until now made for the redemption of the grant of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the grant of Vienne, the transatlantic grant Nasdaq, the Stock exchange of New York, the grant of London and Deutsche B�rse made an offer until this day. 
Petr Koblic, the manager of the grant of Prague, declared last week that among the persons concerned, the grant of Warsaw would be the least good new owner, and did not exclude the fact that it could lead to the disappearing of the grant of Prague in future. 
The value of the grant of Prague is estimated between 5 - 10 billion Czech crowns by the specialists of the market. 
On foundation of an agreement between the stockholders, some 90 % of papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the grant of Prague is the bank of investment Patria Finance, with about 25 for one hundred participations, followed by 14,7 for one hundred banks Cesk� Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Oven S. a.r.l. with 13,5 for one hundred. 
Financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments of Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis, deteriorating from day to day, newspapers leaders of the European press already recall " second September 11th ". 
" Total financial disaster, they owe it to the American president " - accuse the daily of Rome, Repubblica. " The president was not even able of siding together with his own party behind a bill, extemporized slapdash, aiming at helping a discouraging situation... " 
Instead of new Pearl Harbour, as recalled it the multimillionaire Warren Buffett, he is more appropriated to speak about second September 11th. 
A party of the press of Madrid also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it is the breaches of the political direction of over there that brought worldwide economy at the edge of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system accroit every day, and later, the whole world strong price is going to pay it. 
The plan of Bush was far from being improved, however according to the vote of the congress, a real danger threatens, the one what Washington does not offer of political tool to treat crisis. 
Worldwide economy hangs in space, just at the time when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place. 
They can ignore threat no longer - underlines Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Certain states can still tighten a life buoy in their unsteady financial organisms, and thanks to the silver of their taxpayers, they can save them from failure. 
Of course, if some more banks collapse such of the dominoes, then neither medium financiers, nor new improvisations will be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need that the states of the European Union make not enough cases of their national selfishness, and that they centralize control above the divided financial markets. 
Nothing on Monday, weakened financial organisms accepted 100 billion euro more - reminded the Viennese daily, Der Standard, that adds that fears according to which the European taxpayers also are going to have to lay the hand on the pocket, very deep, in a similar manner to the Americans with the intention of putting right crisis, become more and more realistic. 
Heretofore, the EU was not really in charge of the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crosspiece, straight through, the old continent. 
The "rescuers" do not have to throw out hundred billion euro right away, on the contrary it would be judicious if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the silver of the taxpayers, with objective to tell bigger damage. 
The clever car imitates the theft of the bumblebee 
What method would be better to develop capable technologies to avoid an obstacle, if it is not the simulation of a detector of obstacles already existing in nature? 
As for instance, that of the honeybees. 
In the amazing plan introduced during CEATEC, taking place in Japan, bourdonnantes honeybees gave the strategical idea of departure to the engineers from Nissan, to inspire them on the manner the next generation of detectors of obstacles of which they have to conceive. 
In collaboration with the university of Tokyo, Nissan constructed a tiny car robot, a system with order auto-robotized bio-inspired, of type BR23C, that it equipped qualities of honeybees, final objective being to encourage the bet so as to a system able of avoiding all obstacles. 
During its thefts, every honeybee constitutes its own space, in oval form, which in reality, resembles our cockle of reassured protection - a lot explained, during exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the manager of the department searches and development and technological public relations of mark. 
L '? he in facets of the honeybee plays a primordial role, since it is able of seeing in all directions, in 300 degree angle. 
To imitate functions of l '? it in facets, the engineers approached the idea of the t�l�m�tre with laser. 
This one identifies obstacles in a 180 degree angle and at a 2-metre distance in front of BR23C, it assesses distance and sends a sign to the microprocessor of edge, which transforms it in man? uvre of siding right away. 
The perception of obstacle takes place in a split second. Then, the auto tiny robot, imitating the movements of the honeybee, changes the direction of its wheels immediately by turning it of an angle being enough for avoiding collision. 
Contrary to any system existing nowadays, this man? uvre of siding take place entirely in a instinctive manner. 
" If it was not there so, the tiny auto robot could not react rather fast to avoid obstacle " - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the manager of the Laboratory Agility and plan takes in the car robotized. 
She must react in a instinctive and instantaneous manner, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and the most internal coat of the envelope of protection, a coat where at the moment collision is considered unavoidable. 
All this process must reflect what the honeybee makes to avoid other honeybees. 
Process must take place in a clin d '? it. 
In contrast to honeybees, difference cannot go from above, downwards or in diagonal, she can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction in which wheels can turn. 
In that way, instead of infinite combinations which have honeybees to avoid other honeybees, in our case, they could use only rotary movement, acceleration as well as slowing down as man? uvres at the disposition of the tiny auto robot 
BR23C uses batteries polymeric Lithium which are lighter and the concentrated solution of energy of which is bigger, what returns their longer life than in version Lithium - ion. 
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive clever reaction which is primordial, not the data processing, and even less the capacity to be stocked. 
This mechanism must treat only some entrants signs a second, and react to these. 
It is not necessary to stock them and to react with the intuitive logic being based on the data of man? previous uvres. In that way, it uses only some dozens of kilobytes of memory continue it. 
They do not need memory with a capacity of gigabytes, nor even megabytes. 
It is the first step towards the comprehension of a technology being of use for siding instantaneous. According to estimates of Nissan, this system will make its entrance in the serial fabricated cars in next ten years. 
Another application could be its enlistment in the system of navigation by satellite GPS, so that he can guide the driver towards his destination by avoiding obstacles being on his way. 
They even gave a name to the priceless infant 
The written version of the plan of economic 700 billion dollar rescue, aiming at buying back the suspicious credits of banks, and at using there several times, is ready. 
In the first turn, the half of this sum is going to be spent. 
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates persisting jusqu' after midnight, Saturday, local time of the coast is, the leaders of the Congress came to an agreement on polemics existing for days and days, around the plan of rescue of a 700 billion dollar sum. 
" We performed a seriousness not forward " - declared Nancy Pelosi, the democratic chairwoman of the American Chamber of the representatives, according to which it more does not remain than to put agreements on paper. 
The compromise, been born from plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and JOHN MCCAIN. 
The American secretary in the Treasury, Henry Paulson, declared by commenting on the results of compromise that program is going to work and will be efficient, however other measurements must again be put there? uvre. According to Pelosi, it is not a matter of the rescue of Wall Street, here, but to make turn the clockwork of economy in the other sense. 
The written version of plan was made public before the opening of the Asiatic markets, on Sunday evening at 20 h, local time Washington time (that is to say on Monday at 2 h, according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause spectacular rise in grants. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first one to vote for the bill answering in the name of law of urgent economic stabilization of year 2008. Then, his fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
On Saturday evening, the president George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then, the White House also greeted the news of agreement. 
" We are satisfied of advanced attained this night, and we appreciate hard efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy " - declared Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
Moreover, program diverges from the initial proposal made by the administration Bush, which it, mentioned that the 700 billion dollars must be only once spent in, for the redemption of titles concerning suspicious credits. 
Hereafter, maximum the half of the sum of 700 billions can be spent. The first 250 billions will be immediately issued after the adoption of law by the Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be of use for the Treasury Secretary to buy bad debts of banks, while the use of the 100 billion additional dollars will be left in the discretion of the President. 
Program will be supervised by an independent organism, in which the president of Federal Reservation will also take part. 
The expense of the second half of the 700 billions depends on a new decree of the Congress. 
According to law, the secretaryship in the Treasury will be able to set up a combined strategy: he will be able to, all at once, buy bad debts, titles concerning mortgages and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" credences. 
The competent persons of the ministry declared that redemption can take place as part of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule gives possibility to the concerned societies, to take part in a program of insurance, where the secretaryship in the Treasury guarantees tools at the origin of anxiety, for which firms will have paid an identical bonus to foreseeable damage. 
Henry Paulson declared that law provides the necessary tools so as to dedicate 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is about the vast redemption of bad debts, about their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system entrainant collapse of one or other important financial institution. 
" We are going to take the necessary measures, to be ready for the application of law, as soon as it will be signed " - he added. 
On the other hand, the leaders of banks being in poor positions and waiting for the help of the State can expect that their indemnification of departure, called simply American gold parachute, will be culminated by the government. 
The ceiling of wages is mentioned only in very definite cases. Besides, limitations depend of the manner the secretaryship in the Treasury offers its help to the firm. 
The principle of ceiling means that if the secretaryship in the Treasury buys back as part of an auction, they will take a sample of a surplus of levy from the gold parachute, unless the discredited president of bank retires. 
Directly after the redemption of bad debts, the government will intervene in a aggressive manner to be sure that sum poured to the leaders is not exaggerated. 
So that picture is complete, it is really necessary to add that the existent gold parachutes are not changed. Ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate participation so on plan. 
It is the first time in the history of the United States that lawful ceilings will be in force concerning the salary of the managing directors - commented the president of the commission in load of the financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the democrat Barney Frank. 
Besides, the State obtains a right of acquisition of parts in banks taking part in plan. In that way, the risk of the taxpayers diminishes, since they can even be winning in affair as soon as economy and with her saved banks will fall again on their legs. 
Bill mentions that in the coming five years, the President must introduce to the Congress a proposal which will give a ruling on the way in which losses are going to be restored to the taxpayers, from the financial area. 
On both sides, there were of course those who expressed their doubts in comparison with this plan. 
It is not for it that the American citizens delegated us, this does not protect the dollars of the taxpayers - declared the republican deputy of California, Darrell Issa. 
Her democratic colleague of the Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that it is the same who senses the catch of measurements, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The review of the papers of the German linguistic territory 
The camp of right is undamaged, it is only in c? ur from the party where the voters became more aware - that's how recalls Der Spiegel, weak score of CSU in the Bavarian country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the alliance of reds and blacks. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the Internet edition of the German magazine of information of left, Franz Walter analyses reasons of the dramatic defeat of CSU in its called article " The revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers ". 
According to this acknowledged political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before that the sad duo Beckstein-Huber takes up its posts. 
The christian socialists transformed the Bavaria during decades and now, it is these same modern citizens who turn the back to them. 
This change of epoch is the problem of all christian democracy, and because of this or that also that of Angela Merker all at once. 
For CSU, failure was not completely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process arrived eventually which was probable there is it, hardly ten years old: the unquestionable hegemony of the national party ended. 
There is it ten years, in 1998, CSU huddled up with 47,7 for one hundred, and it for the first time since the fifties, with a score downstairs of level of 50 for one hundred. 
It was repeated three years ago during elections of the Bundestag of 2005, that is to say at the time of having so much recalled Stoiber. 
Reason can be attributed to modernization there " devouring his parents ", set up in the region in a substantial manner by CSU. 
It is 40 years since the sociologists announce it but they hard made a mistake concerning rhythm. However secularization, results of education and establishment of German of the north and from the east in the region of Bavaria, rapidly developing, could not stay without consequence to the fidelity of the voters CSU. 
A modernization goes hand in hand with the increase of opportunities, and consequences of such policy are also visible. 
The camp of right is undamaged, it is only inside the party where the voters became more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is amazing also that for these last weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens that rather moved away from CSU, such as independent, artisans, possessors of the receptacle and qualified of studies superiors. 
In these groups, the support of CSU went down underneath 40 for one hundred. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his called article " Who? With whom? Them president of party is held on reservation faced with the questions of the alliance ", the conservative Austrian daily is in charge of the situation of the confused domestic policy which became established after Austrian elections. 
The Austrian socialists of the SP � want to discuss with the conservatives of the �VP. 
The �VP forbids in SP � to mingle of its internal business. 
The populist BZ party � proves to be opened for negotiations. The greens do not yet want to come to an agreement on the alliance. 
Elections took place, now everything turns around the alliance; during debates organized on public television, the leaders of party have barely let foresee their cards. 
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP �, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with l ' �VP. 
SP � wants to show that the collaboration of both parties is really possible - it is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership. 
The question according to which it would imagine an alliance with Wilhelm Molterer, the actual president of l ' �VP, as vice-chancellor, the rest opened on behalf of Faymann. 
As it mentioned it, orientation Sch�ssel-Molterer was rejected, anyway. 
A retort of this combination is out of question. 
Molterer reacted with caution to the proposals of reds. 
As he has already said it, a collaboration will be surely fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in internal business of l ' �VP. 
In its party, the choice of opposition or entrance in the alliance is momentarily a wholly opened question. These points must absolutely be discussed within l ' �VP. 
J�rg Haider, the president of the BZ �, proves to be opened to any proposals once again. 
" To avoid the alliance of reds and blacks, we are ready to take governmental responsibilities " - declared Haider. 
J�r�ka declared: It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation 
Today, starts the European summit, in Paris, for the Equality of chances, from which the guest is France, as representative of the actual presidency of the European Union. 
In his message displayed in front of the plenary assembly, as one of the main doors-words of experts' consultation, L�via J�r�ka, eurodeputy Fidesz Parti Popular European, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of right that touches most the roms children and because of this or that one of the main brakes in their success in life.

According to the office of press of the group of the deputy Fidesz Parti Populaire, J�r�ka told that next to differentiations determined during appointments, roms disappears from job market, above all, following their weak skills. 
" An enormous majority of the young persons roms do not have certificates of secondary, and as a result of inferior basic education, alone an insignificant party has the possibility of acquiring a certificate of higher education. " 
Moreover, J�r�ka stressed the fact that education as basic right of the human being plays a key role when they must emphasize other fundamental rights. 
The investment in the precocious education of the roms children means a strengthening of the economy of countries members of the European Union. 
According to the eurodeputy, it is necessary to make become aware of these reports in the broadest possible circle, also between roms and - roms. 
In effect, earlier a child rom begins the school, more he augments his chances to become a productive member of labour market; by levies paid from his income and from his consumption, it participates in the Budget. 
" All over their nationality of the European Union, roms has to be insured parties of their right to a quality education, and protected from an education of weak quality and sectarian. " - underlined L�via J�r�ka. 
According to the deputy, a collaboration of the European Union orientated to an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For it, the respect for existent and preparing directives of anti-discrimination is of a primordial importance. 
" It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployed person. It is necessary to give possibilities assured by democracy the roms children, so that they can participate as citizens by right in the future of Europe " - demands J�r�ka. 
In the name of ' " Year European for the Equality of Chances " assured for all, the objective of the Summit for the equality of chances in Europe organized every year since the summit in Berlin the last year, is to assure an unique platform to support measurements taken in favour of the equality of chances and for the conflict against discrimination, having aimed at European level and at the level of countries at members. 
CSU: favour for a period of transition 
It is in October when will be made the decision carrying Huber-Beckstein on the fate of the striped duo 
In spite of it pitiable electoral failure, heads did not fall yet, and the debate on personal questions in the summits of Bavarian CSU was deferred. 
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the regional head of government, G�nther Beckstein, can again keep their place. Question is to know to when will last favour? 
The fate of the tandem, having sustained a loss of calamitous voice of 17 for one hundred, will be in the agenda of the congress of the special party, held last weekend of October. 
The members of this very criticized pair made felt, anyway, that they were not especially fond of their seat. 
Thanks to it, they applied themselves to soothe down the members angry at fraction and at foundation, who a day afterwards " tsunami Bavarian " demanded personal consequences for the loss of absolute majority. 
There is it five years - that's true, still conducted by Edmund Stoiber, at the top of its career - the socio-christian union carried off 60,7 for one hundred, while today, one year after putsch against Stoiber, there remains only 43,4 for one hundred their force. 
During 46 years, CSU was ' " only sovereign " of the Bavaria giving 18 for one hundred German GDPS. 
But, the conservatives always count hard in this region of the south, key importance for Hungarian economy. In future, they will be compelled to the alliance. 
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, introduced as the possible successor of Huber, also accepted a place in this modest group of recognition, who initiates debates in let us try with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Voters, formed along the stocks of right, regarding a possible alliance of the government of Munich. 
A foot of strange nose of destiny was that with the aid of the list of the Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli enters legislation, as whom the catch of measure against Stroiber acted of possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to treat then the very ambitious local political woman bluntly. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize Beckstein, in either way. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now drew twines in the wings, will also accept an active role. The ancient regional head of government and ex-president of the CSU, indicated September 28th as the most bitter day of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber threw some acrid comments towards CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support on behalf of the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU interpreted defeat as a warning for CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Further to elections Bundestag, which will take place in September, 2009, Merkel will once again be able to be chancellor's wife only if they delay on foot somehow, with a common force, CSU, having played a role mattering in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hiding hardly its disappointment caused by failure, the loss of ground of CSU will not influence the big alliance of Berlin in a negative manner. 
What is however relating because it will not be easier to manage hurt CSU, and crisis of the socio-democrats hard always. 
Since 1946, SPD attained its most poor results with 18,6 for one hundred in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0 
No deputy of opposition achieved the Byelorussian Parliament after elections of Sunday. 
According to the Russian watchers, it explains by a country aimed by Alexander Lukashenko, who assures him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and the Collaboration in Europe (OSCE), it explains by unlawfulness made during the study of polls. 
OSCE, having sent 450 watchers of 43 countries, does not acknowledge elections. 
Although legislative composing of 110 persons in this country of 10 million inhabitants goes very well without opposition for long decades, before yesterday elections, opposition joining his force under the name of Democratic Joined Force (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his president's mandate for the fourth time during suspicious elections, on the traces of the modification of constitution in 2006, would "allow" the presence of some deputies of the opposition to the Parliament this time. 
In that way, ODSZ abandoned sound boycott envisaged in origin. 
The fact that the Byelorussia, depending economically more and more Russia, would like to ameliorate its reports with the EU, where because of Byelorussian political order qualified as antidemocratic, Lukashenko and several politicians of high rank do not accept entry visa, was one of the wait of opposition. The Byelorussia has of take a credit because of the reduction of the importation of Russian natural gas, always dearer, and contributed so to the passage of the society Beltransgaz, owner of the conduits of gas crossing the country, is handed of Russians. 
The fact that OSCE, during the valuation of the campaign, put the emphasis on positive changes rather than on breaches, as for instance ban to come for a third of the candidates for opposition, referred to a prior abatement. 
However, the press release of OSCE of Monday has already questioned the campaign, during whom the bulk of the candidates for opposition could not appear in mass media, and particularly fact that opposition could not be present during the study of polls. 
Nonetheless it, opposition really feels a palpable improvement in political regime: the political prisoners found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always by refusing to acknowledge the Ossetia of the south and Abazzia separated from Georgia. And, Russia with whom the Byelorussia forms a confederation on paper, considers both independent territories for already a month. 
" We made two steps forward, and a step behind, but the most important is that dialogue was begun between the Byelorussia and the EU " - declared Alexander Milinkevitch in our newspaper. 
According to the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it stays so, even though " power was afraid in this Parliament with no weight, to get the single opponent even ". 
Opposition does not envisage actions of protests in view of results. It tries rather to forward its message on the necessity of economic reforms to the voters. 
" Of course, we have a lot of worries in that direction: we must make print our opposing newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us of staffs in wheels as for broadcasting, but I can note also that they are more and more to support elections, even in the circle of the old persons " - declared Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the actual regime of Lukashenko, which considers French national health and pensions organization to be its main result, the coat of the retired men most supported officially does not consider it any more as appropriate really. 
" Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of French national health and pensions organization, ' recalling the silence of a graveyard ', am not more than a question of time " - estimates Milinkevitch. 
Contrary to the politician of opposition, the Russian watchers qualified elections as democratic. 
Serguei Lebedev, aiming the mission of the Community of States Ind�pendants, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: " People do not believe in words, but in acts. ". In that way, the absence of opposition is only the proof of the adulthood of the Byelorussian voters. 
Brunetta: " As from today, breakfast before job ". 
Never, in the history of the Palace Chigi, not had had swivel doors as the entrance and the exit of the employees. 
But to leave d? today, this new measure against the clever babies is in force, against whom clock in and go then to drink coffee to the bar during hours of employment. 
The novelty anti lazy was introduced by the minister of the Public administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the general secretary of the presidency of Council, Mauro Masi today. 
� The swivel doors tells Brunetta-are an instrument to work better, with more productiveness, more presences and more services " definite the minister. 
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparence. 
" It is reformism " Brunetta underlines besides. 
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency of Council complements each other with the Palace Chigi. 
According to Masi, " the choice of the swivel doors is important even from a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance on behalf of the employees was recorded, assures the general secretary: " it is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all ". 
In short, more breakfast during hours of employment; more coffee nor crescent. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests by smiling, " a good cappuccino at 7 h is very good and healthy one resolution ". 
During a conference in the College of higher education of the Public administration 
from Rome, the minister announces that ' "? in three months, the absences of illness of the public employees were reduced of 50 %, are 60milles workers furthermore in one year ". 
And he adds that it is necessary to be productive more efficient, the Public administration. 
Italian, " whose wage dynamics explains the minister these last 8-10 years doubled in comparison with the private area, and definitely outrage the rates of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, united to question the norms of the decree Brunetta making appeal in Codacons. 
" " while the minister of the Public service displays data today concerning the fall of absenteeism on the workplace because of illness written the association of the consumers the people of " lazy active " continue augmenting. 
In effect, in Italy, thousands of productive and correct employees of the Public administration, met to declare war on the illicit norms contained in the decree. 
Particularly, in Tar, they question the exclusion from additional benefits in case of infirmity because of service; the extension of the timetables of the timetables of domiciliary permanence of the ill worker, during which are performed follow-up visits, as well as other aspects were contained in the new dispositions wanted by the minister. 
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: " Critical Prevention " 
Every day, in Italy, they count 2.500 working accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain disabled permanently. 
In 2007, data Inail confirm in effect, when white deaths were about 1.200. 
Figures which manifest the seriousness of phenomenon which remains one of the main reasons of decease, and causes almost twice more deceases than the homicides. 
To have the attention of institutions, social force and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, Anmil celebrates the second Sunday today of October, in all Italian provinces, the 58th national Day of the victims of accidents on job, institutionalized. 
" The worrying data broadcast by Anmil, as well as tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention on the workplace ", asserts the president of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the president of the Anmil, national Association of the mutilating and disabled persons of job, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his " sincere evaluation for associative uninterrupted effort in favour of prevention on workplaces, protection of the uneven workers, assistance in the families of the victims and the sensitization of public opinion " 
" of course outraged, everybody knocked of the fist to put an end to such tragedies which, all over their dimension, provoke the clamour of mass media and the participation of public opinion, even if daily reality introduces us of dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics. 
Napolitano does not hide that ' " there is a problem of means indeed: it is essential to invest in training and information " 
Numerous initiatives promoted in the scholastic area, take a very particular importance for a more direct realization on behalf of the young persons who enter the world of job. 
It is of our duty, to support attention towards this phenomenon, not not to assess alarm on social seriousness, apply and ameliorate legislative norms. 
For his/her part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini underlined in how much " this phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, who insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort aiming at putting an end to it fast ". 
The data of the accident victims on job seem to signal a light positive tendency, but it does not prevent that the number of white deaths is impressive all the same " underlined later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
" we do not wish that this " tendency in discount " attention is translated in fact, in a person under 18, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy arrives. 
" we think that in dress rehearsal, they do not make enough to give contrast to the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be performed thanks to numerous actions. " 
" According to us underlined Mercandelli-more controls and examination is necessary, very as a more important intervention on the training of the workers, and this, from the school. " 
- He added " that it is necessary to make another effort as regards communication and sensitization of public opinion. 
" But it is especially needed, a bigger sense of responsibilities on behalf of the employers faced with a phenomenon which represents a social emergency. " 
� Mercandelli then reported " the progressive deterioration of the conditions of maintenance of the indemnification envisaged for the victims of job " and the " drift of assistance to which the system turns these last years ". 
� The objective therefore, is to give again to the worker the guarantee of insurance? he added so that the destiny of the one who has an accident, should not depend on the spontan�isme or on the enlargement of the legislator " 
Reader Mp3 checked off by the finger, they put audition in risk. 
To listen to music with full volume during extended period using portable musical apparatuses such as the readers Mp3, can cause permanent lesions in audition. 
Here is what announces the European Commission, that, in a press release broadcast in Brussels, names the opinion of the scientific Committee, on unforeseen health risks and newly identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
" of this scientific report read we in the note it emerges that 5-10 % of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with full volume using portable musical apparatuses, during more than one hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity. � 
" I am anxious due to the fact that such an important number of young persons who often use portable musical apparatuses and mobile phones with full volume, can harm their audition subconsciously in a beyond repair manner " Meglena Kuneva asserts. 
" " According to scientific data follows the representative EU it is about a clear risk and we must react fast. 
What counts most is to sensitize the consumers and return this information of public domain. 
We must re-examine besides, the existent systems of seen control scientific opinion, so that they are completely efficient and can follow new technologies " 
Brussels asked the independent scientific Committee, to examine the problem, seen the intensive use of the portable musical apparatuses and increase among young persons displayed in the noise which these generate. 
" The scientists - concluded executive EU confirm that there are good reasons to get worried, and that the European Commission will examine with Member States and other interested parties now, which measurements could possibly be adopted to protect better the children and the teenagers, against exhibition in the noise coming from portable musical apparatuses and similar apparatuses. 
There is already an European norm of safety which restricts the level of noise of the portable musical apparatuses in 100Db, but anxiety augments as for the auditory damage which could derive from an extreme exhibition in such sources of noise. 
It is possible to restrict well these data making appeal in resolutions as the reduction of levels and length of exhibition in noise. 
The scientific EU committee points out that the users of portable musical apparatuses, who listen to music with full volume (more than 89 decibels) during 5 hours a week, exceed the relating borders nowadays in force at the level of noise maximum approved on the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions during extended periods, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after 5 years. 
It interests 5-10 % of the users of these apparatuses, and their number can be quantified in the vicinity of 2,5 and 10 million persons in U.E. 
Rome, Alemanno gave order to make leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we shall draw sums. 
Here is the calendar fixed by Capitoline for jobs of the " Commission for the future of Rome capital ", which has set up this morning, in the new seat, behind the Thermal baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will perfect directives for Rome. 
In March when they will have ended, the Committee and communal Council will assess analyses and plans, in order to introduce in June, strategical Plan for Rome with the " official stamp " of Capitoline and his mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
" " The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented wants there to underline Alemanno-she will have to offer ideas of development of Rome which the political d�cisionnaires will be able to use, which remain the Committee and communal Council. 
No superimposing of roles, but only will to have a corner where to work out a big plan for Rome. 
In March, it will finished its tasks and will disappear then, because this experience must have a temporal definite length. 
In June - the mayor announces we shall introduce the existent strategical plan of the job accomplished by the Commission for the future of Rome capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, seen that its opinions will be constraining, Alemanno retorts: " Everything depends on the job which the Commission will be able of making, as well as of the quality of its proposals. 
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as besides in Rome, I follow by it on, his provision will be fundamental. 
Too often policy is scourged by the management of the daily and the emergency which manifest themselves from time to time. 
We, contrariwise, we want to see from the front, and farther, towards a deeper futurology, working seriously in the development of Rome and of its future. " 
Besides, the mayor of Rome wants to underline that " this Commission is not an useless organism nor a bureaucratic group: it is absolutely free, and will not cost an euro to the Roman townspeople, and will serve for being studying and for making participate the best secret relations which express the Capital. 
For Alemanno, in effect, " one needs a draft of strategical reference, neither firm nor immobile, to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking in its future supporting an unit mind, ". 
A future which, specifies the mayor of Rome, " will not limit itself to habitual communal borders, but who will look farther " not only in perspective of future metropolitan city and of its legal status of Capital, but " as in comparison with the role as Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and Mediterranean Sea ". 
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why. 
A famous American politician who wants to pass for independent, wrote: " Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in part its decisions, destroyed economy EMPLOYS and had relationship (as besides he always has today, as private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
Attacks against Obama augment while the date of elections gets closer. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a Website: " this person is full of ambition ". 
Obama is really seasoned: he thinks that he will earn the highest function of a nation which counts in all, two governors and five black senators! " 
In reality, it is about attacks which do not say thing big; they are of course attacks of racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We have besides opinion polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still about somebody who speaks with c? ur and with no cerebrum. 
A newspaper of Mississipi, in the entrails of the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the cabin of vote, we know definitely to whom the American patriot will give his vote. 
And then appears an aspect of American mentality supported secret till the end. 
" Said what you want, we shall see us even to give up, on Obama or on McCain. 
There are even persons who swear: if Obama wins, we shall leave States Unis. 
Things never revealed up to now, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, in spite of all these reasonings, the winning card for the democrats is George Bush. 
They asked 1500 persons: what were errors made by Bush during its mandate? 89 for one hundred answers: Iraq. 
America changes. 
In the Vietnam, this nation lost 50 milles soldiers and was returned at her in kicks in backside. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers died, and the Americans were not forced to pack suitcases. 
Nevertheless, Iraq was, mostly, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Which will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to be fulfilled. 
USAs, economic breaking up is even felt at the journalist's: in the press, it is the hour of abolitions. And many people accuse Internet, this "slaughter" some newsprint. 
PEW Research Center regarding the status of their occupation and mental control called out to five hundred American journalists for future. 
And definitely, almost all journalists are pessimistic today as for their future. 
However, they did not declare openly to the attaches of information, to feel less anxious regarding credibility. 
They do not feel insulated as in the past. 
The problem of the American journalists, it is silver, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic destroyed model. 
Besides, abolitions performed in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assemblage of newspapers, are a big problem. 
It is a problem which must be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if they wish that the traditional journalism such as the general public hears it, is reduced in a following manner. 
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades the American journalism. 
Six of ten seniors executives and journalists of newspapers of printing are persuaded that the journalism at national level is following a poor way. 
On a local level, the executive group is in 65 %. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
The journalists do not feel pain to see where goes the web. 
The biggest houses editors make a passage towards internet, perceptible by many as " the murderer " of some newsprint. 
The " economic pressure " which smell the journalists is augmented up to 79 %. 
The 500 interviewed journalists allowed to put on in technology hoping that she " makes something good " for their journalism. 
Today, the biggest tear in the American journalism domiciles between whom aims newsrooms - that is to say the managers and the reporters who work for them. 
56 % of the managers at national level, are persuaded that the reporters share their stocks, while at local level, this percentage goes down to 23 %. 
For some, it is linked to the " safety of job ". 
The managers who think lose their workstation in the space of 3 years, are 47 % at national level. 
As regards the journalists, they go to 30 %. 
That of " sure job " at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always in agenda. 
Only 13 % of the journalists work under contract. 
In a huge nation as USAs, with 300 million inhabitants and the thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, the employers often give what they want, and it becomes fast a question to take or leave. 
The managers accept almost big wages always, while the editor can earn one 10 thousand dollars a month, besides retirement and payment of insurance. 
As for vacation, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, until 15 days in everything, crossed a certain number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often "ill " during year. 
It is the error of climate. 
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA. 
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the authority of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, which had asked it will leave its city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy as part of the education relating to climbing Unipol-Bnl. 
During trial in his load, last week, it had acquired the domiciliary releasing transformed into obligatory residence in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go through the itinerary of the city of province in a house in the capital. 
According to the court, such displacements (that the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and to have access to the proof which accuse it. 
Elites in danger. 
Phenomenon had already manifested itself some days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, opposite to the plan of 700 billion dollar rescue approved by the White House: Americans' a good many significant was, and is him still, more interested to punish Wall Street that to save American economy. 
And it is definitely yesterday New York Times which confirms it to us announcing that actual crisis divides the republican Party, even more shared between its wakefulness soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as in community business, and its new soul, contrariwise, conservative, hostile to " those of Washington " and in the world of the finance, powerful especially in the States of the Centre and of the South. 
The soul, precisely, which was felt in a despotic manner with the vote about which I spoke to you at the beginning. 
However it what has just been named is only an example of changes, big changes that ongoing economic earthquake preannounces or already lets get away: not only in States Unis, but in all Occident, and can be not only only here. 
In States Unis as in Europe, crisis seems to make speed up phenomena brooded for some time, to such an extent that, in new climate, they solidify and show themselves. 
The first of these phenomena is updating, extraordinary revival, of the double category sovereign State, in comparison with a kind of renationalisation of economy. 
Crisis, in effect, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, of course of narrow relationship with the foreigner, but that, first of all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of the persons and the families which live in the single Country, in the single State. 
It creates immediately a political problem for whom governs it: that is as answer difficulties and protests of the persons and the families which are besides an electorate. 
In short, crisis appears economically worldwide but politically, she is almost only here national. 
Political internationalization really seems offside or, does not have thing big to be said: obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union which, shared as usual, between various interests and between various national strategies, succeeds in deciding on no common political line. 
And so, it is from the government of every State that all expect for interventions, for plans of rescue and for revival, of new rules, and especially a disease of credits: when they cross a difficult period, there are only the States which have the economic means, the mass of resources able of trying to put back in place things. 
They also have medium essentials and legitimization to use them: two means of an invaluable value, elements among which no market and international organization will ever be able to have in a similar manner. 
This new grandiloquence of crisis state-nation is besides in perfect harmony with the importance always major which the more recent economic developments of economy tend to allocate to a factor linked enough to this element: territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, in effect, while we were persuaded to have consequently entered the kingdom of network, technology always more sophisticated, not equipment, persuaded than finance globalis�e was consequently intended to dominate the world, we realized an only one just like that, while our future will contrariwise have to settle its count always more with little material things as water, crop, oil. 
Things which can indeed be transported from a place to other one of the earth, but that are linked in a absolute manner to a limited space, to a territory. 
So, which is sovereign, indeed has more cards than the one who is not him, that is to say, the one who has the bad luck to live in a place without crop, without oil and without water. 
I arrive now at the second novelty which however envisages a fracture. 
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Political, and therefore Leading role. 
In this respect, economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
Of one quoted, the authoritarian conscience of the objective need of leading role, the research of a person who knows how to take situation in hand. 
Of other one quoted, wave of disrepute for leading roles existent, economic kinds which turned out to be inadequate and full of zone of shade. 
And besides, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a disrepute, a suffering, a picture of unsuitability, a feeling of distance that tends to implicate the whole class of the managers in a number growing by Country of Occident. 
So augment even more the firm belief of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites up to now in their peak, how they listen and of are, their culture in the complex approval of term, to have the same time, and to be always more foreign in the opinions of majorities. 
in short, The request of leading role, feeds in a underground manner, a mighty and ramified movement of d�l�gitimassions of the ruling classes and of traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in improvised electoral "uprisings" or, in changes d ' collective moods of these last very last time, from conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of the Labour MPs in Great Britain, in the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and it would be possible definitely that the win of right in Italy does not arrive incidentally). 
They have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say somebody, always have more difficulty, what does not date today's, to understand and therefore to represent the deep coats of the western societies, and which economic crisis reinforces, augments and agitates potentially in a immoderate manner. 
At the sight of all that, to speak about an actual " rebellion of masses " in agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But they say definitely, to keep eyes big opened, it is not without reason. 
Superglue to walk on walls. 
Conquer the laws of seriousness thanks to a great glue and, in future, walk on walls as Spiderman. 
Here is objective of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has it almost succeeds. 
With an adhesive measures barely 2,5 square centimetres, the researchers succeeded in supporting glued together a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall. 
STUDY The magazine American Science published the discoveries of certain researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The equipment, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those that we know which use a particular structure of carbon, called nano tubes of carbon. 
" The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of disposed tubes as a pile of spaghetti. " Zhong Lin Wang du Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta explains. 
The scientists drew inspiration from legs of the geckoes, covered with microscopic hairs which allow to assure the animal, a perfect follower. 
Tests were performed on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and sandpaper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times as powerful as the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it " breaks loose easily from the wall " explains Liming Dai, seeker of the faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
TO WALK ON WALLS?? " this equipment could be used as temporary adhesive " Liming Dai adds. 
Can be to walk on walls as Spiderman? Can be that yes, but the researchers think of a much less intriguing use of such as of connection between the electronic apparatuses, seen that nano tubes of carbon are drivers of warmth and electric current. 
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering. 
At the moment, not great heroes. 
OTHER ONE SEARCHES The University of Berkeley, in California, also devotes itself, in search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the American magazine American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers introduced an adhesive formed by micrograins as hair, which auto cleans dusts during movement on an area to guarantee a perfect and constant sticking. 
Medicaments: never with juices of fruits. 
Attention in the juice of grapefruit, orange and apple. 
These drinks, used especially the summer because thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, so linked to certain vital medicaments, corrupt the diminishing or amplifying absorbement depending on circumstances, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, professor in University of Western Ontario in London, reminds of risks of juices of fruits that they are, ingestion of certain medicaments limps with it or cool, so linked in l '; during the 236th national meeting of the ongoing American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he throws new one alarm: a glass of juice of grapefruit, orange and apples is enough, to reduce the absorbement of certain vital medicaments, cancelling them advantageous effects and putting the health of the patients in risk. 
The juice of grapefruit was already hard criticized because kept representative to augment the effects of certain medicaments anti arythmiques, antibiotics, anxiolytiques, anti staminales and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS RISKS It is the Italian Agency of medicament it even, which had given news in a news bulletin dated of two years, alerting the doctors and patients in not not to assess the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take medicine as for instance, Diaz�pam or M�thadone. 
NOT ONLY THE GRAPEFRUIT According to the experts, even the juice of orange and apple contains substances which inhibit medicaments. 
Long is the list of the active principles inhibited by the grapefruit and the other juices. 
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, manager of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: " these discoveries are in general, immediately signalled to the various national and international agencies of medicaments which will owe to the need, to change the informative notes of medicaments. 
It is always necessary to read illustrative papers of medicaments which they take, and, if something is not clear, not to make impress, but contact apparently the doctor or the chemist " underlined the expert in the agency Ansa. 
Nobel of economy to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel prize of economy was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for its researches on the models of trade and on the location of economic activities. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a neo-Keynesian which teaches the University of Princeton and he is besides a famous leader writer of New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of resolutions in economy and foreign policy of the administration Bush. 
Some months after the murder attempts of September, 2001, during the days of the failure of Enron, Krugman had written, in an article published on New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in term of consequences to the history of the United States. 
A prediction which roused numerous debates, and one reproached for that the economist during years, but that supporting turned out to be precise. 
" I am surprised and the same a bit shocked of the fastness with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public " Krugman at the end of 2002 had declared. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, from the executive committee of the European central Bank, Krugman is a " considerable economist ", but also a divulgateur in very aggressive, particularly critical " style towards excesses of the liberalism of the administration Bush. 
Open Service, here is the third edition of the packet "anti-Microsoft" 
It is the day of the broadcasting of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open suite source of personal productiveness which aims at touching always and some more users, the home in the office, professionals in the public administration, offering a free alternative in the most famous Service Microsoft. 
Further to a job of almost a year, accomplished by developers volunteers, watched by SUN Microsystem, the new packet Open Office shows itself to the general public with various novelties: of the screen of welcome, and the interface seen again and become less severe, in others more important, as the compatibility been born for the system op�ratif APPLE MAC BONE X, and the support for new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, last standard ISO version. 
Open Service paid attention particularly to correlation with suite Service 2007, and it is in effect possible to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
Such interesting, certain specific functions with certain modules, as the one who allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for instance, to send them by email, or to matter of goes off PDF in the module of graphic elaboration, keeping the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this forehead, it is possible to create documents " PDF hybrids " which join the graph typical of format Adobe with the elements of a leaf of counting or a �laborateur of text. 
The collaboration between several persons is an element with various improvements inside applications: in the leaf of counting, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because to every collaborator is allocated a colour of comments for a better recognition in stage of review. 
Certain societies even are working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (one the cloud, on the cloud), and in next weeks, they should issue final result. 
Italian version is d�chargeable at address http: // it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and is added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
Extravagant in Windows and MAC BONE, suite is as usual available besides, for the system op�ratif Linux. 
If required, the cd of installation can be sent or on the workplace at home. 
And if the topic of unwarranted nature can be a means to broadcast it in houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office suite attracts the big challenge, being able to already rely upon various plans accomplished in the public administration and schools. 
Without counting the realities which give a service of training, consultation and of assistance, ideal for small and medium enterprises, who could besides open towards futurologies of business. 
Open Service is made up of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the leaf of counting which aims at replacing Excel; Impress, for presentations rival of PowerPoint; Dbase, such celebrates it Access, the program is which allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is graphic module. 
Objective for 2008, to arrive at 5 millions of download, and considering that today they count almost 3 millions and 600 milles, it is probable that with the exit of new version, they can even exceed the envisaged figure 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth case of dope. 
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is about the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, described to be third, and victor of the undershirt of the best rock-climber. 
It is the site of the daily The Team which brings back news. 
In 26 years, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, Epo of third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricc � and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, them too of Gerolsteiner. 
The blood analyses performed on Kohl's test tubes are part of those accomplished these last weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If them against analyses confirm positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Turn and owe forcing to discount two years of elimination. 
The news of Kohl's positivity in Epo of third generation, was confirmed by the leader of the French agency anti dope, Pierre Bordry, which communicated in Associated Press, to have notified positivity to Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian of 26 years was situated on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, making off the undershirt so with pea of the best rock-climber. 
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy " as Country of emigrants was newly transformed into a destination favoured for the immigrants " received with reservation. 
Would it transform the Nice country into a nation of racists? Here is on what int�roge New York Times which devoted a long article discussing the topic of racism in Italy, leaving the case of the young person Abdul William Guibre, native to the Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, to have flown one limps with cookies. 
This case puts in an obvious place what New York Times defines as the " paradox of the north ": the Nordic regions are at the same time those where they record " more incorporation and more job ", but also " a feeling anti-immigrants most extremely country and the most important support of Lega Nord " 
To confirm growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Small castle Volturno. 
not only. 
Even the new term of office wanted by Lega to slow down immigration and make easier the expulsion of the aliens, is named as proof of the change of climate in Italy. 
Tendency underlined by the Pope as well as by the president of the Republic: " Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Beno�t XVI in Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to conquer racism. " 
Students victims of the dear rents, up to 900 euro for a room. 
The market of tenancies for students not connait no crisis 
According to the last inquiry of Sunia, the labour union of the tenants, to rent a simple room can cost to a student, until 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
" Phenomenon consequently attained very serious aspects so as to exclude whole categories of young persons, the right to study because of the very well brought up total expenses which the families of provenance have to support explain the representative for the research department of Sunia, Laura Mariani-in these cities, the strong request on behalf of the students so much distorted the market that a process of made general increase amorc�m�me for the inhabitants. 
In most cases, the offer of tenancy includes a series of violations besides: contracts of free type, not recorded, without border of rent, sublease. 
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the review of the fiscal taxation, are necessary to tranquilize prices. 
Reading the inquiry in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the zone Brianza, it is needed about 450 euro; for a simple room, they go of 650 euro minimum (zone Bandages Nere), in a medium value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Will Trust) in a 900-euro maximum (zone Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costs a room on average, 350/400 euro, about 700 euro. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in zones close to the University, it is necessary to 250/280 euro for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a simple room. 
In Rome, in zones close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they ask for about 600 euro for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Lightly lower stocks (550 euro for a simple) for zones close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt�). 
They can economize only if they move away in zones p�riph�riques:300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the zone Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed 300/400 euro, for a simple are needed, they spend 400 - 600 euro, with higher prices in zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute term, but they have a major importance in city economy. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which tenancies are often taken by extra Community students, they record subsequent one anomaly: the rent asked the foreign students is increased of 25/30 % in comparison with that applied to Italians. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities wear thin the historical rooms. 
The historical cinemas close in favour of Multiplex systems. 
" A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is as a face without eyes " 
The picture given by the movie director Giuseppe Tornatore, famous good what there happens in the big Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalization of cinema, with birth in periphery of the big multirooms, and death of decline of monoskiing rooms in the central zones of cities, is one of the major events that appears to us ineluctable and incontestable; it has on top of that all characteristics of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear, these are often places historical and loaded with memory, " it's as if one of my friends disappeared, somebody whom they know, with whom we shared an end of way and so much emotions " notices the movie director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film which gives in Tornatore he there 20 years, the first Oscar as well as the Grand prix of the swearing of Cannes, and that told the poem of a room of province, and the nostalgia of a manner of living the cinema, lost can be forever. 
Figures provided by Anec, the main association of the dealers, very want to tell: these last five years, 316 cinema of traditional type closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that especially paid expenses: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palerme. 
Among the most affected regions by the closing, Emilie Roman is at the head with 82 cinema monoskiing rooms lost, having followed by the Tuscan (44) and Lombardie (41). 
The proof which confirms t that the first representative for their disappearing is the advent of the multiplex system, because it is definitely the three Italian regions which recorded most new cinema multirooms: 195 screens on top of that in Lombardie this last five years, 81 in Tuscan as in Emilie-Romagne. 
" Italian working developed in a irrational manner " Paolo Protti, president of the Anec notices, " it is useful to construct new structures, but it would really be necessary to guarantee the survival of those who already exist, because when a room closes in a city, this fr�quenteurs all is not out of necessity disposed to go to multiplex systems. 
Without speaking about the deliberation missed credit in favour of the dealers: the previous debt of the State is 10 million euro. 
It is ashamed that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existent laws. 
To support the area, it would be needed between 16 and 18 million euro per year. 
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worries these closings, decided to solve situation thanks to the signature of a protocol between Town hall and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to defend and promote cinema monoskiing rooms of the historical centres and in periphery. 
Among normative envisaging, there are measurements of fiscal opportunities in favour of the managers and in the advantages as the public in term of agility: the audience will be able to enter the zone to restricted circulation, and will have special rates as parkings and in certain parkings. 
" It is an initiative which me plait " Giuseppe Tornatore " notices and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measurements. 
It is however obvious that, to give contrast to the great potency of multiplex systems, the traditional rooms also have to ameliorate the quality of sound and picture, because the today's public is more demand. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is a topic which for me, was always important: the closing of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark which persuaded me to make " New cinema Paradiso " of which I have thought already for 10 years. 
I saw in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of Rialto, or the Quirinal de Via Nazionale, consequently closed, when I so much lived on shared emotions, I turn of other one quoted not to see panels blackened by dust. 
Links between policy and? ndrangheta, stopped mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
� The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town hall in the interests of the clan Piromalli. " 
heavy accusations are thrown by the magistrates of Direction antimafia of Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, stopped this morning for external competition for mafieuse association. 
Levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the ancient mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his small son lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already condemned for criminal conspiracy of type mafieuse, as well as to pay 10 million euro. 
" an affront towards normative juridical and moral, and especially common sense " write the prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed will to pay consultations to master Piromalli. 
" So they would have been granted in the clan - write the judges to enter officially inside town halls making easier possibilities, already considerable, inside control and inside orientement of the public administration " 
The president of the regional committee calabrais Agazio Loiero, does not hide that " conspiracies between the local committees and the organized crime, there is more one " in his region: " there are places where mafieuse intensity is stronger than in others, where conspiracy is almost unavoidable. 
But there are also many politicians who resist to the pressures of the ndrangheta, of heroes who are honest " 
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, further to which the police announced have decapitated the clan Piromalli. 
From the end of last April, the communal advice of Gioia Tauro had been dissolve; already in 1991, and always because of supposed conditioning between the organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been relieved of their function to manage the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been named leader of a right alliance of centre, after the absence of an absolute majority in the first round of May, 2006. 
He shouted in scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of communal advice. 
He accused vice Interior minister in epoch, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having been up to the whole for a political question, but seen the request of imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the clan Piromalli had even succeeds in asking for the variation of the plan of A3. 
Leaving interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, pm writes, is appeared " the availability to marry requirements of a businessman, representing of a more known group, close to Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration in the interests of the clan. 
When energy is born of spaces, supporting the big launch. 
Here is an immoderate deposit which occupies more than 70 % of the area of the planet and now the big worldwide companies of energy are discovering it. 
Spaces, currents, tides, here is the new renewable sources on which giants as Rafter put down eyes, and now try to lay the hand on it. 
The possibility of acquiring energy from the movements of the sea is studied for consequently hundred years, and in the seventies, in coexistence with the first oil crisis, researches intensified. 
When the price of oil lowered, by 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy been put aside, but supporting ecological authorities and new increase of oil give a big development in the area 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007, that 15 % of the worldwide need in electricity could be covered by operating systems of the heave of seas. 
This quantity would be the double of the one that produce the nuclear power stations. 
And on top of that, there would be currents and tides.. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first one undertaken to bet on marine energy was Enersis, in 2005, with sigl� an agreement to construct an installation north of Portugal. 
When understanding was announced, they would have said a truth not revolutionary. 
In two years of it, always more candidates among these firms dedicated always in traditional energy bet on marine energy. 
" Rafter studies technologies on oceanic energy nowadays she declares the spokesman of a company linked to the American oil giant, to the economic daily Wall Street Journal-and assesses the possibilities of collaborating with us ". 
Collaboration being discussed, concerns the getting of a licence deliberated by the American commission for energy, essentials to give rise to a plan of working of marine energy in Alaska. 
Here is a very interesting sign, especially if they consider that precisely in Alaska, USAs continue extracting some oil, and newly the president Bush set up a plan for new unearthing 
Extravagant in Rafter, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power du New Jersey, which go through the way of energy from the sea, and sums invested untill today, although their details are known, point out according to the watchers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to put just in time. 
The experts speak about a technology still at its beginning, about part the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears towards ecological impact. 
In present time, systems as those of Portugal, or some Shell it, is small, and do not seem to create of big problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with the upper ecological impact. 
" And choices are various: Ocean Power, for instance, uses a system of linked up water wings them some in the others. 
The increase of spaces, which makes move muck from above and bottom, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of plungers and cylinders inside floats. 
Pressure makes turn a turbine which in its turn, feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the bank through cables under sailors. 
At the moment, we have four systems of this type in stage of plan, looking forward to an only federal approbation and a party of energy could be of use for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, contrariwise, already produces energy for a shopping centre and a parking using six turbines under navies of East River of New York. 
The movement of water during tides, made turn the pales of turbines, creating a rotary movement which feeds a generator. 
Verdant announced have customers' long list in wait of the necessary approvals to scoop out energy. 
After spaces, tides. 
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the research of the electrical power, deserve, the potential of tides at present. 
Although it is about an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more foreseeable of the wind, the sun, or of spaces, and therefore more dependable as source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look towards coasts, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and envisage investments up to 35 millions in 2009.
