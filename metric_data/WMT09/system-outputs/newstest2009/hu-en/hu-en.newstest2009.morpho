The interest rates are on an identical level with that of United States in Hongkong. 
Kevin Rudd the American lawmakers should restart the negotiations promptly according to an Australian prime minister, and the support proposal of the financial system should be accepted. 
It is threatening otherwise, that other countries feel the consequences of this. 
The bloodbath of the American shares 
The American chamber of deputies rejected the draft of the support of the financial system on a Monday, onto which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion crowns) it would have been necessary to translate. 
The lawmakers left it out of consideration hereby George Bush a president's call onto the support of the plan. 
The draft would solve the capital reasons of the monetary crisis according to Bush, and all would help with stabilizing an economy. 
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on a Monday and the driving share indices registered the largest fall under 20 years. 
Dow Jones experienced a fall with a fallen, similar measure in 1987 recently with almost seven percentages. 
The index fell before the vote already, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the chamber of deputies, the index started a freefall. 
The congress stepped back: USA's government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks in this manner 
The American congress's principal leaders and George W. Bush a president's government they reached an agreement about the wider form of the agreement and in the financial help to be provided for the American financial system. 
They vote on this on the front of the coming week. 
The American lawmakers reached a breakthrough from the approval of the ambulance plan in continued negotiations for the American financial system 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns) in the form of financial help to be provided in a sum. 
But there is not a victory yet. 
Some details of the agreement have to be finished before the definitive form of the law and their vote could be made public for the congress. 
The support draft of the financial system is dealt with in the chamber of deputies on a Monday. 
Reuters informed it about this on Sunday news agency the president of Barney Frank, the financial organisations' commission. 
They may vote on the draft on a soon Wednesday presumably according to senate sources. 
There should be an announcement according to economists from that direction that a row, which the first important psychological factor of the money markets' revival is, gets to the approval of the rescue plan. 
A row gets to awakening however following this duly for the complexity of the mechanisms. 
Paulson: The plan has to be efficient 
We took a big step. 
We solved our different views in connection with it, what the form of the packet being used for stabilizing the market has to be like, Bloomberg mentioned it to an agency the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
A row may get to the definitive vote on Sunday yet according to it. 
The lawmakers' representatives Saturday Henry Paulsonnal, the American faced a night with a Minister of Finance in order for a definitive form to be provided to a government basis. 
This should buy up the unmarketable mortgage assets, which land the financial firms in serious losses, from the financial companies and the stability of the whole system is jeopardized. 
We are near to the definitive agreement from a draft that will work, and for which has to be efficient at the same time on the market. 
It is necessary to continue the corrective draft yet, but I reckon that we are there, Paulson said it. 
Mark for the Asian trading 
The global monetary crisis has a considerable effect on the stockmarkets, which fall ardently,. 
Harry Reid nevadai democrat the lawmakers strive for reaching an agreement about the congress finally on Sunday yet because of this according to a senator. 
The investors want to be reassured with this before the start of being in the business on the Asian money markets, where from the time zone adódóan the congress's decision could influence the Monday trading firstly. 
Temporarily yet but unclear, when the American congress's two chambers vote on the law, it, the negotiation may not stall in the last moment because of a some kind of problem. 
The lawmakers hope that the law gets to approval in the next days. 
The law passes through a number change yet however. 
It is necessary to divide the whole amount devoted to the help of the system into two parts. 
George Bush according to a president's request for the first 350 billion dollars at what should stand for a soon provision. 
The congress may block the emission of the remaining sum however, that in another 100 billion dollars and they made the decision about 350 billion dollars later, in as much his feeling will be such that the program does not accomplish his function. 
Bush appreciated the improvement in the negotiations 
The congress but his veto may revise it although the president may veto this decision. 
The fundamental idea of the program remained however despite these changes, that the bad mortgage losing their value the acquisition of devices was material one serving the acquisition of stocks, since more hundred thousand Americans are not capable of the instalment of his mortgage credits. 
We drew everything up. 
From the law the chamber of deputies should be capable to vote on Sunday, for the senate though on a Monday, Judd Gregg mentioned it Republican senator. 
With the progress reached in the negotiations Bush American president satisfied. 
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman declared that the president is satisfied with the Saturday's improvement and values it at stabilizing our money markets and our economy protectingéra made bipartisan efforts . 
The limitation of the abundant severance pays 
His president told it to the bank commission of Christopher Dodd leading negotiations, the senate, that the lawmakers agreed upon the responsibility vouche for the financial program, taxpayers' protection because of the losses, from the sealing of the discounts, and from the timing of the financing draft. 
The new law in the program participant headmasters ún. limits his abundant severance pays, and it creates a commission supervising a basis. 
Ministry of Finance should direct the basis. 
We worked on this very firmly, and we put a big improvement into the direction of an agreement that will work, and that everything American will be useful for him, Paulson said it. 
The plan reckons with help provided for those householders, who has problem with the instalment,. 
For the government the mortgages bought by it should haggle down new instalments, with that aim, that let him reduce the debtors' monthly instalments, and let him make their houses' keeping possible for them. 
Marek: Spiritual aid 
The proposed draft according to David Marek, Patria Finance driving economist brainwave, but his realisation will be very heavy. 
All this because he may not be to be top notch, that the problematic assets with a what kind of mechanism and on a what kind of price it will be bought up. 
This will be determining in that direction, how the financial sector and the government share the losses out between each other how, said it on the week iHNed.cz for a website Marek. 
According to Marek onto so much not essential it, that the plan now, or it is approved on the front of the coming week. 
It is much more important for the congress to decide that the plan is favoured on this week already, and their blessing is given as soon as he may be. 
The spiritual significance of the fact that an agreement should be born from that direction, that the plan gets to approval, the most important thing in this moment, Marek emphasized it. 
Fight on an edge of blade: MP3 players counter mobile phones. 
We help, how he should make a choice 
While almost all mobile phones are capable MP3's onto the playback of files, making a phonecall may not be one single MP3 with a player. 
From this appears clear, that right to buy a telephone only. 
There are many reasons despite this onto him, that the man let separate MP3 obtain a player. 
The choice depends on the manner of the usage and the prospective proprietor's claims totally. 
Presumably difficultly obtains onto a home high-end expensive record-player, that it newest Maxim Turbulenc disk let him listen to it. 
The musical products like this do not appear on bakelite discs on the one hand, but from a qualitative viewpoint exists in this direction any kind of objective reason. 
If but the winter of his shelves they are art you are rock, jazz blues with bakelite discs, dreams about a record-player like this presumably then. 
This is similarly onto the travel sleigh, that is condensed - simplified MP3 with music. 
A price and qualitative categories exist here. 
Eight may be unacceptable for a player for single ones to publish a thousand crowns, as a Pink Floyd is a fan presumably difficultly accepts an twenty crowns of market earphone. 
Two are an extreme, between which there is enough place for everybody,. 
The choice is wide. 
The lifetime of the elements counts 
Some high-end musical players are capable of much more, than the plain playback of the music, but in that direction, onto which the majority of the mobile phones even accidentally. 
One single current apparatus so universal, than the telephone. 
The primary functions, the telephoning and sms beside sending, can play music and a video, to absorb both, there is a right-worse camera in him, indeed yet even may navigate. 
And if we take it into consideration the smartphone-his computer will be okat and communicators, little one in his pocket. 
This a little miracle, since an any kind of fridge is top notch grillezni and one single television cannot take a photo. 
The more function mobile phones have disadvantages because of that. 
At what uses more functions on the mobile phone, the display sends it repeatedly to the charger at it. 
And the music playback one of the largest energy gobbler. 
Few mobile devices are capable of the playback of music at ten-twelve clocks until longer time, mostly this much less. 
In this look the musical players (particularly the plainest ones) with a significantly bigger performance. 
Let it reckon with it because of this at cheap mobile phones, that they will not be playing long for you at a couple of clocks. 
If he makes a phonecall here and there moreover yet, obtain his workplace for the mood of the safety yet a charger - this concerns the more expensive apparatus. 
It will not be MP3 at players his problem like this, even the worse ones bear at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charging. 
The next problem the music onto a mobile phone the charging of truth arises. 
Unfortunately the part of the apparatus limited only with a socket and apart from this is at universal USB disposal not all can be connected directly to the computer without special software. 
Naturally the music directly onto the memory card fixable, but only little kártyareading tackles miniature memory cards in use without an adaptor in the mobile phones. 
At the players with some exceptions (iPod) he needs any kind of special software. 
Enough the apparatus from the computer with music to recharge through USB. 
The majority of the mobile phones and players already himself the lecturer, the album-, the name of the genre, you are for example the user's assessment creates a musical library placed into an order on his basis. 
Some apparatus depict a tree structure similarly to Windows Explorer only, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, clever telephones with an operating system). 
The players more easily can be treated, the mobile phones know more 
Let the lifetime of the battery, the memory ask the selection of the actual equipment about his capacity, the quality of the sound output and his type primarily, and naturally from the comfort of the treatment. 
If the music is in service as background primarily for you and daily listens to it until short time for example on the tram only, any kind of MP3-at player a mobile phone suits you. 
In this direction though already really any kind of mobile capable one. 
Does not have to listen more especially, how musical formats the mobile phone or a player know. 
It MP3-al all wrestles and the deciding majority of the music getting to you will be like this in a format just. 
It MP3 between most widespread ones owes and apart from him the deciding majority of the apparatus WMA format tackles music. 
AAC (Apple by way of a firm and format used for his iPod) is found less. 
The right mobile phones make it possible for example likewise it on-line music shopping. 
Burns through the mobile phone internet to visit the service provider (you are an other service provider) his suitable sides and to buy the song or the album. 
This service may be a cogent argument merely already onto the purchase of the musical mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, the service providers' supply lousy and generally only annual rádióslágerekre restricts. 
The prices are not the lowest ones. 
Universally but probable, that the music just his selling manner like this (even GSM-n, on internet, you are cordless through internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
The peoples' majority keeps his mobile device by itself steadily. 
His mood arises any time to lend an ear to something, his mobile phone feels it in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 is a player at home is lying. 
Depends even on it however, wears the earphones with himself always you are at least the loud ones. 
If not, may use the inbuilt loudspeaker, with which everything is mobile almost,, but only little MP3 player takes action. 
For many people the musical mobile phones the price will be his largest benefit presumably. 
The cheapest ones generally three thousand crowns they cost less. 
He may obtain a rather honest walkman already between three and four thousand crowns. 
The deficiency of the output of the traditional earphones limits you however mostly. 
Telephones installed mostly may get into fifteen thousand crowns even with the earphones with a traditional hole with a diameter of 3,5 mm from the best and technical viewpoint. 
The plain manageability is the benefit of the players at the same time apart from other ones. 
The plainest one - in no way inevitably the cheapest players (see our choice) everybody tackles his treatment really. 
Minimal function, the manageability being similar to a customary coffered cassette player or a gramophone early obvious. 
Collapse is not threatening in the form of the WAP switched on accidentally, and regarding the enormous account following this for the data transfer. 
A what kind of apparatus we shall select 
For the cheapest mobile phones (pl. Vodafone 527) too there is them opening generally onto the interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, stb.). 
The suitable card buying fits into at most two thousand crowns. 
But let him be cautious because of that. 
The standard makes only the at worst 2GB cards with maximum capacity it is favoured. 
The most expensive ones are top notch only what to start it even 8 GB with memory cards. 
If he has a mobile phone already and cheap MP3 would like to buy a player yet, let Cowont elect it, the Creative-ot, the Sony-t, Samsung, you are Emgetont irivert. 
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) 1 100 are not needed crown more to spend. 
Let him select special mobile phone walkmans rather if he belongs to the more demanding listeners (Sony Ericsson, few Nokias and Samsungs). 
These apparatus separate MP3 they have a handler button, the comfort of the treatment comes close to it hereby it MP3 that of a player. 
Sony Ericsson, which is the identical application interface of the series mobile phones of a walkman, was left farther in the section is, than the MP3 sold separately for players. 
The foresaid trademarks the players of MP3 can provide an identical service in an identical price range until four thousand crowns, but bigger memory with capacity (even 16 GB) and with a battery lifetime (generally 15 clocks, at most 35 clocks). 
The first virtual service provider it gets into Czech Republic this year yet. 
Possibly 
The Czech Republic mobile phone market relatively advanced and our service providers offer the same services practically, than their Western European partners. 
We miss something here despite this - the virtual service provider forcing the classic service providers into essential reduction of prices. 
He will not be for a long time in this manner already possibly. 
Mobil.cz we wrote that the Czech service providers are the most expensive ones in Europe many times already on a website between it owe. 
ČTÚ fixed this anyway, that called attention to the fact that it is the price of a sms in Czech Republic more expensive at the rest of the union's countries. 
After European Commission's latest step the roaming onto the regulation of prizes a controversial situation may arise possibly hereby - the Czech mobile service providers some clients of his from the foreign countries küdött sms-ek they will be cheaper at the domestic ones. 
How possible, that the Czech Republic prices compared with Europe so tall? 
The answer plain, is missing in the truth into a fight to fly wanting rivalry. 
This sounds controversially possibly, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration high 100%. 
The mobile service providers complain that the Czech market is rival extremely with pleasure on the contrary. 
Pavel Dvořák, the president of Cseh Telekommunikációs Hivatal Tanács, who declared it several times early, agree with this many times, that a newer service provider is not eligible in Czech Republic. 
Possibly true, that the classic service provider does not have too many chances presumably already with an own network (would find a frequency difficultly presumably already however). 
But there is an opportunity however yet - the virtual service provider. 
The virtual service providers stepping onto a mobile phone market brought considerable drop in prices, to which the classic service providers had to respond then, just. 
Meanwhile even before the so big fish stepping onto a market, than Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile are similar to ours in Great Britain for example sounds were heard. 
It proved true however that the service providers like this are eligible and they may be successful in truth. 
We do not have to go far for an example however. 
We informed you in February this year Mobilking from a virtual service provider's Poland departure. 
E is not afraid entirely for a service provider managed to obtain more clients under a year at 100 thousand and the of that place one fifth largest service provider to divorce. 
Meanwhile behind Mobilking Penta a financial group is at a standstill, that in Czech Republic apart from anything else U:weaves his proprietor. 
The virtual service providers' benefit onto the much narrower target group the opportunity of concentration. 
To the efficient function he needs much fewer clients at the traditional service provider. 
Relatively tall building one does not work-, mobile network operation and with maintenance costs. 
The virtual service providers appear in the world as an one with a low expense generally in this manner - cheap calls and sms-t offer, that but often with fewer services counterbalance. 
In this manner for example British Tesco Mobile his competitors with at least fifty percentages cheaper sms-ket offers. 
But good pull may be whole as Poland Mobilking example shows it an to bet on a target group in that manner. 
This it a service provider concentrates on the men specially. 
The real men Mobilking service provider it is elected - who they may trust says who they like David Seibert, this virtual service provider operator Mobil Entertainment Company general manager. 
Heavy to tell he, whether to the Poland one a similar plan may work out at us. 
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman doubts a dog: The Czech market relatively small to the segment approach, on which the virtual service providers' majority is based,. 
Apart from this in terms of the supply of the services relatively satisfied. 
In Czech Republic having no chance, the mobile service providers claim it 
Appears almost safe however, that it will not be Mobilking if a virtual service provider will be some kind in Czech Republic. 
E we talk about the successful expansion of a project, but the negotiations are not disappearing in Czech Republic too for one holding out hope. 
A row gets in our region's other countries rather to Mobilking starting, said it the Mobil.cz-in the given telephonic interview of nek Jana Studničková, Penta a financial group's spokesman. 
He justified that the Czech Republic existing mobile service providers do not sympathize with this thought extremely indirectly with this. 
Contradicts just, they are struggling along on all of them from them can be passed to cover in order that an any kind of potential rivalry should be allowed to come into existence. 
GTS Novera group already a time of his the virtual service provider does not conceal his interest his starting, that wishes to take a newer step in the interest of it hereby, that Telefonica O2 let him turn into a real competitor on the company clients' field. 
It interests us very much, that our clients not only cable, but let us be allowed to provide mobile telecommunication services. 
Namely at what first, it right. 
We negotiated with some Czech mobile service providers about this opportunity repeatedly. 
From among them he managed to make progress with some already in the negotiations, Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman say it. 
May be, that right times come now. 
From unofficial informations it seems that we may have the pleasure to meet the first virtual service provider until the end of the year even already. 
The wall of impenetrable hush surrounds his birth temporarily however. 
We do not reckon that a virtual service provider with a full value would be eligible on the Czech market in this moment. 
The Czech market is very special as opposed to the rest of the markets. 
Society flax, a subject offering a complex and serious project on this area did not address us until all this, mentioned it the Mobil.cz-nek from 02 of Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica press departments. 
The rest of the service providers refer to the Czech market's special situation. 
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile spokesman it O2-vel adds it to it agreeing exceptionally: Till now did not record one single viable one and two-sided beneficial business project, on which it would be possible to base it long,. 
And added it to it: T-Mobile in a network until the end of the year not probable , that an any kind of virtual service provider appears. 
There should be an actual agreement on our table in order for it to be possible to think about a short distance like this already in this moment. 
Vodafone's attention rather own 3G the fulfilment of his licence requirements turns it towards it. 
Miroslav Čepický adds it to this: We are open onto negotiating with the possible virtual service providers, primarily on the area of the sharing of the expenses and an infrastructure. 
We consider this the most rewarding one just from the viewpoint of the clients. 
Vodafone's capital strategy on this area partneragreeing to the fast WAP onto divided networks' development. 
Responsible offices - on a string with the service providers 
The mobile service providers' procedure easily understandable, a newer service provider's entry would mean the rivalry's increase, to drop in prices and would lead to the decrease of their profits with this. 
So why we shall facilitate the entry of a rivalry like this? 
They are able to collaborate when something is important for the service providers, U bears witness:weaves his birth protraction. 
The ČTÚ-ra the largest pressure presumably T-Mobile firm U:got harder around the birth of fonjának. 
From this direction the informations which can be reached publicly are evidence of ČTÚ website. 
But now just U:weaves comes well as an argument, how we shall not allow the virtual service provider's entry why. 
Martina Kemrová added it to this: The environment of the mobile phone market's rivalry recently heightened the fourth mobile service provider managing to get onto a market. 
In consideration of the Czech Republic mobile phone market's character obvious, that a newer playful entry of his onto the market and his services would make tall demands. 
In consideration of the mobile service providers' attitude like this but directly astonishing the Czech regulator organs' full unconcern. 
Meanwhile not only from ČTÚ attitude there is a word, for which in Czech Republic unfortunately - from Great Britain and because of other developed countries differently - he does not have the right to intervene in the economic competition. 
Gazdasági Versenyhivatal was eligible for this exclusively. 
But the office relates to all of the problem typically however. 
The virtual service provider stepping onto a mobile phone market would be possible after the mobile service provider would get to a binding only and contract between a virtual service provider from the letting of the necessary infrastructure. 
An any kind of contract like this was bound till now, Kristián Chlapua mentioned it answering our question since the supply of the possible interested ones was not interesting for the traditional service providers adequately presumably, from Gazdasági Versenyhivatal foreign relation class. 
From the service providers' representatives a declaration formulated in this manner would surprise nobody presumably. 
From that office however, which should represent the consumers' interests, and apart from anything else in that direction to watch, that let nobody be allowed to abuse his market situation, this more than strange. 
Kiváltképp, if Kristián Chalupa adds it to it: Abroad, we may observe that them stepping onto a market contributed to the decrease of the price of the cell phone services where the virtual service providers work generally. 
ÚOHS does not belong to the circle of his interests however presumably onto the fair function of the market environment and the decrease of the prices aiming at the pressure. 
In the case really shocking from the reaction of the three mobile service providers turning out entirely moving harmony. 
The question, whether really only from chance there is a word, is obvious quasi. 
As the chance and the hard rivalry's works are the totally identical petrol prices only certainly at the filling stations. 
The office did not discover the signs of the anti-competitive procedure in this case, so he does not have a reason for intervening on an any kind of manner. 
One of the service providers do not have a driving position, that is his market activities with this proportionally his bigger responsibility. 
Necessary devices are missing for the opening of the telecommunication regulator presumably for the virtual service providers' mobile phone market, Chalupa mentioned it. 
The presentation of the market driving situation one from among the number controversial dot. 
The analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by ČTÚ, based on which the telecommunication is the sole market, exists naturally from the visual angle of the economic competition. 
There is not one single Czech service provider in a driving situation naturally then on the market like this. 
Some legal experts but somebody else offer a view - the approval of the network's operator is necessary to the virtual service provider's formation always. 
And for the mobile service provider - relatively logically - his own network he has a monopoly. 
So in a certain segment inevitably dominant. 
But should be one waving minimum for ÚOHS if we would not accept this argumentation yet, that three mobile service providers intervene similarly markedly. 
Meanwhile the complaints of the row of interested ones (included GTS Novera mentioned already company) it is showed, that during negotiating with some service providers into very similar obstacles they clash. 
The responsibility ČTÚ-ra the parry of truth though in the telecommunication relatively usual trick, with which ÚOHS takes his hand off the whole case,. 
We faced this already in some similar situations. 
He did not manage to carry enlarging ČTÚ jurisdiction through the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication in the text of the telecommunication law passed recently unfortunately, although from this a number expert was hoping for the improvement of the situation. 
ÚOHS representatives have to know this well, but presumably others their interests. 
This works when nobody is listening 
Some kind of álvirtuális passes unnoticed meanwhile service providers' function, from which several work already in the Czech mobile networks. 
These are own mobile phone service firms publishing price lists, which are public partially only however,. 
Since multilevel is dealing with with a marketing from firms there is a word. 
In this manner for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many people others offer own mobile phone services. 
The price lists of these firms get to the selected ones only generally. 
The magic is hidden in the fact that the firm makes an appearance as a classic company client, which a big amount SIM is, in an eye with the service provider orders a card. 
Emphasized special offers as a client then (and other discounts) gets. 
It is the trouble that the mobile service provider commercial conditions of some Czech prohibit from the similar preemption. 
If cases about which he talks would arise, conditions of contract from violation there could be a word, with which we would deal,, and that collaborating with the given company could lead to his conclusion, responded with this problem our related question Martina Kemrová. 
But quite unlikely, that the news being about the such activity not they would have got to the mobile service providers' responsible peoples. 
More thousand may be words in the case of the three mentioned firms primarily from a client. 
One single service provider does not defend itself against the procedure like this meanwhile. 
These firms his activity they do not have a negligible profit and meanwhile these - from the real virtual service providers differently - it is not threatened with their own official marketing more especially. 
Miroslav Čepický warns about the possible problems: The law makes the similar speculations possible, however these firms the clients' negligible percentage uses his services only. 
They have to accept that SIM is a card in their telephone besides does not figure on their name, so this may not be at their disposal overall, than the mobile service providers' general clients. 
But the ČTÚ-nak should find this odd at least just. 
An other question arises for ÚOHS apart from this. 
Why should the virtual service provider's birth be hindered if the mobile service providers turn a blind eye to a similar procedure? 
It is necessary to add it to him, that it ÚOHS-nak to the exposure of the such activity he has a relatively strong jurisdiction, and does not have to be satisfied if he does not want it it with service providers' explanation, that no things like this was suspected, and that their commercial conditions prohibit from this. 
When we will not be the most expensive ones 
The virtual service providers' entry brought the perceptible drop in prices of the services onto the mobile phone market as it was over several times in the text already. 
Meanwhile practically in some countries, the classic service providers tried to prevent their formation much or little where the virtual service providers came into existence. 
The arguments used by them were identical practically - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of the services stb. 
They intervened in these moments just however in the developed countries the regulator organs, which the mobile service providers are in no way,, but their clients safegard his interests. 
It was attained by the first virtual service provider, which others observed, having come into existence with formal measures or an informal pressure even next. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulator organs hand over the whole case to each other. 
We cannot get rid of that impression based on our experiences, that the not unambiguous competences come well in these cases for them. 
But let us not give up the fight. 
If the background informations are good and the virtual service provider appears in truth soon at us, the Czech mobile phone market swings into moving again possibly. 
ÚOHS may be left difficultly only if one of the service providers would allow a some kind of virtual mobile service provider's formation indifferent to the rejection of the additional interested ones (his discrimination). 
And we do not stain possibly long more expensively compared to the rest of Europe's parts to make a phonecall. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Let him select the best one 
Let the Czech state anthem lend an ear to four of the processings of his new version. 
On Sunday Mirek Topolánek prime minister Hol presented it solemnly on Cseh Államiság day I have a homeland? the new uptakes of a state anthem. 
Nemzeti Színház orchestra fixed the anthem with Jiří Bělohlávek leadership. 
Four versions stand for a provision - you are a man with a female solo song, with a choir or instrumentally. 
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing. 
Author's Otakar is Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček for the modification of the anthem. 
It iHNed.cz may lend an ear to all four versions on a website. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems. 
Told it to Cseh Rádió early already, that the sounding variations singing selected singers with a young representative sound, which are expressive, deliberately and popular. 
Already his front caught mindkettejüknél, and I was heading at the orchestra onto the clear diction later, the text well his intelligibility and to keep an eye on the harmony, mentioned it. 
The Czech state anthem celebrates his 175. anniversary next year. 
Hol is my homeland? title song Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka struck up in Rendi Színház first in 1834 first title his piece, complemented with František Škroup music. 
Popular Latvian, and the peoples spontánul sajátjuknak considered. 
The first stanza of the song turned into the natural part of the state anthem after Csehszlovákia 1918 forming though. 
After independent Cseh Köztársaság forming the seven state symbols one were left over. 
How the new anthem 
The Prague transport company carries a load first with a chip card on a Wednesday 
2008. October 1 Wednesday writes himself in a Prague transport company's history as that date, when into the undergrounds, trams and the first passenger, whose electronic coupon paper will be in his pocket instead of a ticket, gets in coaches.

The szudéták a referendum was wanted from USA 
The szudéta Germans attaching Šumava to United States was asked in 1945. 
This emerges from the letter that there is in of the Southern Czeck Republic Tudományos Könyvtár collection. 
We want to live under United States' of America patronate at least if we may not be Germany or Austria's parts. 
They turned with this wish in 1945 supposedly szudéta some groups of Germans to USA's president. 
This turns out an magánarchívumból remained from a letter, which is preserved in of the Southern Czeck Republic Tudományos Könyvtár collection in our days,. 
Česky krumlov-i Germans the American president is asked for it in the letter, how the šumavai should not allow a county's re-rendering happening for Czech Republic, that Hitler occupied based on Müncheni Szerződés yet. 
We interpreted the situation correctly and we want to be sure of those words really, according to which the American teams onto the German areas in no way as an oppressor and an enemy, but they arrive as a liberator, is in the letter, peoples, who have it at heart signing Šumava fate with words,. 
With what to Csehszlovákia coupling the szudéta for Germans supposedly - beside the knowledge of the Czech national character - only onto brutality, mercilessness, may not pay attention to understanding, oppression and slavery hope, the authors of the letter ask the American president for it, that let him take over the protectorate above Šumava now and eternally. 
We cannot believe that four million residents would sentence this area to a strange country's opinion for us without a look, that oppresses and upsets the minority, and would contribute nothing to the allies' victory quasi with nothing, consists in the letter. 
The reason, because the authors may not have written under it, supposedly because of the Czech oppressors' vengefulness truth fear. 
If so USA's president the šumavai would doubt Germans' opinion supposedly, there would be enough, that let the šumavai think a referendum of it in a county, his residents wish to turn into USA részévé and they wish to live under the patronage of United States. 
Although the text of the letter may appear slightly naive beside the present knowledge of the history after the war, the szudéta depicts Germans' then expectations adequately according to some historians. 
Yet if the Czech Germans had to suspect it minimally, that from resettling them from the country there will be a word, the opportunity of this from among them only few people acknowledged it. 
Some people waited for it, that it states and Great Britain merged the szudétáknak they reach an agreement about uniform autonomy. 
Others hoped that they are left in Csehszlovákia simply again. 
Gustav Chalupa, České justify this in Budějovice an Austrian journalist was born. 
Chalupa was in service as Budějovice German at the navy on Baltic Sea under the war. 
When the British captured it on the end of the war and the holštynskói it was sowed into a prison camp, more dozens other Czech German jütt to it, how he should teach them in Czech. 
They trusted it, Chalupa said that the Czech language comes in handy for them if they return home then. 
From among the German prisoners living in Csehszlovákia before the war nobody reckoned with it according to it, that the Beneš decrees resettle it from the country on his basis. 
You are not thinking - you pay! 
The emotional campaign attacks the leaders 
It is a most expensive action being aimed at the safety of roads in the Czech history. 
The media campaign affecting emotions that Közlekedési Minisztérium wishes to start on a Wednesday would be qualifiable in this manner. 
Aleš Řebíček a minister's office expects this campaign to frighten off the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government. 
The 150 campaigns costing a million will be game for the television, the radio, the cinema, on the internet, but appears on leaflets. 
He should frighten off the leaders from the speeding and alcohol. 
And should remind them of it, that their safety belts kpcsolják in before they start. 
Primarily the young leaders, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not finally to the professional leaders' conscience wants to sound. 
And what appears in the advertisements? 
The emotions aggressor, primarily human stories. 
The bloody slogan of all of the campaign is evidence of this: 
You are not thinking - you pay! 
The you are not thinking an expression is announced with large letters on the registration number. 
And in the pool of blood though the pay for word acts. 
This has to symbolize that the man may pay by his life for a momentary inattention. 
The advertisement spots terrify the spectators until 2010 entirely. 
The Anglo-Saxon countries' similar campaigns inspired the ministry, where his victims' drastic pictures are accidents can be looked at regularly. 
It is hoped that the number of the accidents and dead persons decreases hereby on the Czech roads. 
The advertisement spots Euro RSCG an agency prepared it. 
Cut it, loosen it for the drivers 
Onto the drivers the cut it, loosen it his system valid. 
It loosen it for them it, when they cross the red light for example, hereby time they save. 
The cut it the danger of the punishment or an accident. 
It is necessary to remind the driver of the risk, Martin Kořán says it, the Na Homolce Kórház traffic psychologist. 
And there is need because of this onto the informational campaign in the press, primarily onto the negative campaign, the psychologist has an opinion. 
Boards calling the driver's attention to the danger according to it are effective less. 
Merges with the environment soon presumably if the board warning about the danger is installed and the leaders do not deal with him, reminded Kořán. 
Olmert would give back all of the possessed areas almost into an exchange for the peace 
Ehud Olmer, the temporary Israeli government's president it lodged in 1967 some areas talked about his rendering practically, that is from Jordánia western coast, east Jerusalem and the Golan plateau, into an exchange for the peace with the Palestinian ones and with Syria. 
He said this in an interview, which Jediot Achronot published daywise on a Monday,. 
We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinian ones, what means it, that almost some, if not all (lodged) we have to give back an area, Olmert told it to the daily. 
We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to hand over the similar percentage of the Israeli areas to the Palestinian ones, he added it to it because he will not be peace without this. 
He admitted that the potential rendering includes east Jerusalem. 
The person who wants safety in Jerusalem and it wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his foot primarily, has to give up a part of Jerusalem as he occurred with one of my best friends, Olmert noticed it sending two July cities onto an attack which worth was been, that some men were killed on his row and a couple of tucatnyian they were wounded. 
Will be necessary in the old town according to the prime minister can be found onto the church mountain, holy and historical places to find a special solution. 
The person who wants to preserve the Israeli sovereignty above the whole city, has to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
This will be out of order, emphasized it. 
Exodus from the Golan plateau 
Olmert gave an opinion on the Israelis marching out from a Golan plateau, which is the condition of the peace treaty to be knit with Syria which cannot be missed according to it,. 
This but from Damaszkusz részéről would claim a certain effort. 
I do not suggest the conclusion of peace with Syria exclusively Golanról truth based on exodus, reminded. 
The szírek it is known well what they have to renounce in order for it to be allowed to be got Golant. 
They have to give up with Iran truth their present contact; they have to give up with Hezbollah (Shiite movement) truth their contact; the regular support has to be given up, that Hamász (Shiite movement), al-Kaida and Jihad (holy war) his terrorism provide in Iraq, the prime minister corrected it. 
Questions after an accident: Are the conductors illegal in the coaches? 
The law does not know, long-distance one in a coach it is not allowed to stroll 
Student Agency came up near Italian Padova in connection with a company's tragic coach accident that question, the conductors and passengers may be traveling during procession in the coach. 
The conductor's activity is in a contradiction with the law being about the traffic activity if we would want to obey the law strictly and formally, Karel Hanzelka, Közlekedési Minisztérium spokesman say it. 
The driver of a lorry crossing the road of the coach presumably ending with the death of twenty-two year conductors caused it on the last week. 
The girl sat beside the driver in that moment onto his misfortune, the bus little his safe place, although even another two places were occupied for him. 
The coach may clash, you are sudden may brake you are in the moment when the conductor serves up coffee offers newspaper. 
Szerepe van annak, a standing place is at disposal of the coach according to the traffic permit. 
The passengers have to ride it if there is not homologizálva in the coach. 
Student Agency coaches do not have standing places; that it Aktuálně.cz-nek Radim Jančura, the firm's headmaster reinforced. 
We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and the passengers did not allow his motion initially. 
This was annulled however, and we managed to get in that direction, that the passengers they may go onto a toilet during the road, in as much they have own seat, announced his point of view. 
The law does not know the conductor 
The unambiguous legal szbályozás concerning the conductor's role does not exist - an any kind of measure regulates this position. 
An any kind of measure prohibits the freighter from the stretching of the services however. 
The law being about the public traffic knows the vehicle attendant's concept only; does not define his rights and his obligations, Hanzelka adds it to it less unambiguously spokesman. 
The headmaster of Josef Pokorný, the traffic ministry's road vehicle operation class thinks that the law handles the problem adequately on the contrary. 
Depends on it, a standing place figures in the traffic permit of the coach. 
And with this his end, says it. 
The coaches may be urban according to their differentiation where there are standing places and limited the maximum velocity, and onto ones between a city with standing places and authorised bigger velocity, and long-distance with seats supplied without standing places and with authorised largest velocity, with safety belts. 
Than on the aeroplane, the expert says it 
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP traffic safety expert does not see a fundamental problem on the deck of the coach in the conductors' motion. 
Much danger, the situation is not threatening in the course of the continuous progress on the aeroplane truth we may compare it to a service. 
Here sure, when there are turbulence and the passenger attendant may hit his head. 
His physical laws are valid naturally if the coach would brake suddenly however. 
Likewise, than in the urban coaches or trams. 
The freighter has to solve the conductors' safety by inner rules, says it and likewise some believes, that in terms of the law the problem not solved. 
Jančura is inclined to the stopping of the services 
Student Agency offers conductor services as a sole freighter by bus. 
Two hundred employ a conductor. 
The headmaster does not consider their occupation risky one after the accident. 
I bring it to an end as soon as it will be my impression like that however that the conductors' occupation is risky. 
The coffee and the passengers may get to the newspapers at the time of boarding. 
This would be a saving, says it. 
Alexej Litvin, Asiana headmaster, who operates it comparing the fraction of services with Student Agency, justified the conductors' deficiency by safety interests in his vehicles. 
Our conductors, this are not caught because of the beginnings we oppose it. 
This ends with some kind of deathly injury first or afterwards, said it hardly with a year before the Týden.cz-nek. 
An incredible tragedy happened 
Two years of working Plzeň young conductor died in the course of a Naples scheduled transport service for the company. 
The Slovene lorry turned without the usage of an indicator lamp from the hard shoulder presumably and it blocked the road of a coach. 
The driver of the bus tried to get out with a sudden manoeuvre, but the better front part of a bus bumped into it. 
It, that the conductors' relaxation maid two reserved seats it would have been sold, Jančura rejects it. 
It is not possible to reserve these places at the long-distance services, blocked. 
The firm wants to sue the leader of the lorry. 
The agency does not wait for the court's judgement with the compensation of the girl's family, but the financial amends from the transgessor part expects it. 
Amendment? 
In the distant future 
The amendment could mean correcting him to the conductors' motion on the deck of the coach, on which more than an the traffic ministry's expert group of thirty works eaten. 
The group but any kind of actual one did not manage to get onto a result. 
The coaches not too onto so much, the point system deals with the maximum speed limit on the motorway rather and with the mobile phone usage during the leadership, Hořín says it expert. 
Közlekedési Minisztérium does not consider the conductors' activity things like that, which would threaten the passengers' safety fundamentally,, Hanzelka finishes it spokesman it, that the check of the safety of the coaches the police and belongs to the employment offices' competence. 
The düsseldorfi hopes depend on Frankfurt 
For WestLB directorate to the bank's colleagues his written letter is not in need of the big words. 
The düsseldorfi for a financial institution's units and the savings bank financial group's central of the capital market organization could come onto existence from the Frankfurt decagramme bank's union - writes it on the Monday published letter. 
WestLB would take a competence block bringing in money permanently into a business like this. 
A contact like this province additional one happening in a bank sector could give becoming interwoven the deciding boost. 
Ez az olvasata annak, amikor egy igazgatóság a nehéz időkben a cselekvőképességét kívánja bizonyítani. 
Since WestLB with a vague situation a huge pressure weighs heavily on a bank in the future. 
Not only his EU Commission, but from Szövetségi Pénzügyi Szolgáltatási Felügyelet részéről, which informed the North Rhein-Westphalian province government about it recently,, how the deadline of the finding of the lasting solution hurries. 
The savings bank one is famous for his investment funds between a decagramme bank and WestLB for clients but already his good time topic the uniform contact - from a Frankfurt part. 
Franz Waas, the decagramme bank's leader already on the end of August, announced it at the time of the review of the biannual data, that Mainzer Landstraßén bank which can be found and a province bank, does not see his sense as Helaba or WestLB fusion for example. 
Despite this the board of directors of the decagramme, which one are, his half the province banks, his other half the savings bank associations' representatives constitute it though, entrusted the directorate, how he should enter into negotiations the WestLB-vel from the common business activities. 
The of the capital market business or its certain parts may be mentioned on the row of this. 
The negotiations but - financial circles claim it - they began now only yet. 
His 3000 colleagues between the more important employers of the Frankfurt financial section owing a decagramme bank's name does not arise first in connection with consolidating the savings bank sector. 
It seemed that the decagramme bank merges for a moment in 2003 Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalzcal and Helabával. 
From this Triple Alliance there was nothing after all however. 
The plans, the Hessen province government were exposed hardly Helaba spoke his interest. 
Following this the other one two banks did not find each other out. 
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz Stuttgart Landesbank found his way to Baden-Württemberg instead of this. 
The decagramme bank and the thought of the province banks' contact were brought up again and again however. 
Günther Merl, Helaba directorate president spoke against the plans of the unions happening to his bank however recently. 
From this the recognition that there is need for the different banks of the communal sector ripens independently his approach. 
BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg contact is expected firstly now, following the Bavaria province assembly choices. 
This is not good news inevitably for Helaba. 
In as much the pressure for the additional fusions intensifies, the possible partners may run out for him gently. 
A partner could be more youthful only in noon Germany, survived the monetary crisis significantly better till now although, than the Munich one and the Stuttgart banks. 
The WestLB-vel happening fusion though Helabában 85%-os Giroverband at who a business share is Hessen-Thüringen the year excluded it on his front. 
NordLB is left lacking right. 
The one like this geostratégiai considerations mean one of the sides of the medal only however. 
The question as what the single banks' different business models suit each other is brought up on the other side. 
Merl declared that the German savings bank one and Zsírószövetség did not give an answer yet in a June onto the deciding question, how it is necessary to insure the province banks' future with a how business model. 
Finally conceivable yet WestLB dismemberment, that but there automatically értetődően do not wish. 
The of that place directorate's letter discusses it in this manner, that they aim for a full solution anyway. 
That this as what can be reconciled with the union of the single units happening to a decagramme bank, it yet his coming music. 
Oktoberfest second weekend Italian weekend on a name known 
For Elena this first one, you are the third already for Luca fourth occasion. 
Elena is as his girlfriend here however now, and in this manner on all of them entirely somebody else, Luca says it. 
Behind them, Kaiser trademark a bearded man with a strong build stands beside a five litre barrel, and Oktoberfestre asserts it for some 200 traveling persons, how deep sounds can entice out from his throat how. 
Elena first waves he hand Luca's face, kisses it afterwards. 
They arrived from a Bologna into Verona. 
On Inn, beside Puorta Nuova pályaudvar coach four buses leave at the time of 23.45 clocks from a car park destinazione Monaco, festa della birra with a travel aim, arrival foreseeably at the time of 6.30 clocks. 
Three buses are considered the Italians above, in the fourth exclusively primarily Brazilian they travel. 
The South-American ones burst into song beside their flag already in one of the poles of the car park, the celebration was started in the course of the night already. 
And so aloud, that it not for the Italians truth - Marco Guarda says it. 
The buses are in the property of long, Marco wearing a coat and wide, glasses with a silvery stem with an artificial fur lining. 
Five of his years travels Oktoberfestre, it organized three roads this year only. 
Night there, daytime Oktoberfesten, at the time of 22.30 clocks home. 
The accomodation would mean a unnecessary expense only, Marco says it. 
The road costs 75 euros, this includes it welcoming Kaiser brewed beer according to the Bavarian beer cleanness law, the accident insurance and the guiding with a German language - a German language course done in Marco Frankfurt. 
And already into him the buses throw themselves into the night on the motorway into Brennero direction. 
There is not beer, is not yet. 
The bus becomes quiet soon, the passengers they sleep. 
This is well they will need their strength in this manner, yet. 
Brixenben and Holzkirchenben rest where several Italian coaches keep a short pause on the 8 motorway before Munich yet. 
When Marco group is afraid according to the plan arrives into the car park near Theresienwiese at the time of seven, nearly 50 other buses stand already, that apart you arrive from Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco keeps a last guide yet, outlines the war plan. 
First: Let everybody put on the yellow cap. 
The German type wrote to this with letters on his left side Oktoberfest inscription legible, beside it the URL of Marco travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: When the gates of the beer tent, running open - Marco intestine shouts it into the morning. 
Run! The occupation of places which can be found in the rear of running and the tent. 
Not ahead, because we come to halt, and let all yellow capped one not sit to the same benches, but let us be dispersed in the tent! 
The one-litre jar costs 8,25 euros, Marco yells it. 
And not to forget the tip. 
Teach the safety guards, that you behave well! 
Let them be occupied as you leave your place. 
Thirdly: Your fly is afraid in a dot at the time of eleven again in the evening today here! Is that understood? 
And immediately direction Wiesn. 
On the way one of the men as road sign yellow caps ties onto the trees, the boards, indeed onto the election poster of one of the big Bavarian people's parties. 
It is necessary to prepare himself for the withdrawal. 
This Oktoberfest second weekend, which is an Italian weekend on a name, known. 
There are not accurate figures; who get across talk about 50 thousand men they burst in in the beer tents on Alpok, ten of the percentages of all of the visitors of the weekend arrive from Italy supposedly. 
Seven South Tyrolean policemen strengthen the Munich police, Italian volunteers help Bajor Vöröskereszt, that the Italians occupy the first place in his national statistics with some 200 medical supplies, preceding the Austrian ones (cca. 80) and throbbing underwear required his degree British (cca. 60). 
Among the Italians especially popular Hofbräu beer tent. 
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors 
The German banking system relatively stable, Peer Steinbrück emphasized it federal Minister of Finance yet only on the last week. 
Yet fortune, that the politician the relatively word used it, and his message even it weaved, that the crisis-like developments do not spare the German bank sector. 
Because this ensued on the weekend. 
Daxon signed Munich Hypo Real Estate (HRE) ingatlanfinancing a firm received a billion credit from the German banks' consortium, how he should protect himself opposite the market turbulences. 
A person knowing the situation informed Reuters that the credit supports run to 35 billion euros on a Monday. 
Hypo Real Estate-nek has to pay an interest after the part of which advantage was taken only. 
The money partly on himself-, comes from alley banks partly. 
In the background Depfa a subsidiary company's losses are at a standstill. 
Depfa making state financings added money to long-term projects according to a news item rental, and to these onto exceptionally short expiration refinanced himself - what is not possible already now because of the distrust reigning on the markets. 
2008 of his first half-years the bank's cash reserve 2, 37 million decreased by 95 percentages to an Euro, and the proportion of the own capital moderately, from 1,6 1, 45 sank onto a percentage. 
The incomes going on and the net incomes originating from the money market regressed to zero with the identical period of the previous year in an eye, to the claims truth from crediting and particular stocks, and the incomes originating from the liquidation of the credit business's provisions more, than they plunged back onto 5 million euros with 70 percentile decreases. 
Only former Depfa for taller incomes originating from the reimbursement of his subsequent settlement expenses for a group's transformation, and for the reimbursement of the interests according to the dues order and was duly directly for the businesses brought for companies belonging to the syndicate 16%-os income deficiency relatively moderate. 
The former one államfinancing speculated with corporate real estate loans, which got to a separation in Aeral Bank later, first following the privatisation happening in 1990. 
Depfa threw himself into the infrastructure projects more powerfully since it was possible to do from the classic state financing little, and the magáninvesting and into the state's common projects (private-public-partnership, PPP), and broadened his activity out internationally. 
Onto the subsidiary companies' value Hypo Real Estate-nek has to do descriptions like that now, that an essential effect is has on the group's result statement - it was announced quite universally. 
Fact, that his dividend payment did not happen. 
The dividend already onto 2007 the harmadára it was reduced. 
Hypo Real Estate since Depfa receipt considerable state and infrastruktúrafinancing was divorcing. 
He depends on the interbank market refinancing better since client deposits are not at his disposal compared to other financial institutions. 
American Lehman Brothers investment bank the banks' granting of credit between each other dried up since the banks preserve their liquidity with his collapse before this with a fortnight. 
Hypo Real Estate-nek Depfa credit portfolio a part of his - for some 50 billion euros - his refinancing he needs short term devices annually. 
According to Hypo Real Estate communication the group's financing claim onto the time which can be recognized with the credit down he is covered, and the company saved the currently in a big measure because of out of order international money markets' influence. 
He is provided for the monies until the 2009 ends of the refinancing duly according to other sources. 
Georg Funke, HRE directorate president declared it opposite this, that Hypo Real Estate does not have to take advantage of the money markets until time which can be recognized for a group. 
Német Szövetségi Bank and the federal one financial service supervision (BaFin) it is seen in that manner, that Hypo Real Estate a group's marketability is insured already now. 
This provides a hope to the bank's shareholders and his creditors. 
But they may not be certain in him because of the dynamics of the crisis and his immeasurable. 
It is not unimaginable that it is not necessary to take advantage of the financing in a full measure. 
But the contrast of this can be excluded. 
After the bank was doing on the edge of the bankruptcy yet according to the Saturday's late-night news, yet onto the equal one his transitional rescue was not able to calm it down the tempers. 
The share price plummeted to 3,30 euros with 75 percentile decreases. 
The bond prices carry themselves well opposite this. 
It ordered backwards while the top-rated debts change hardly the exchange rates of bonds went back significantly. 
The crisis particularly the previous subsidiary company's, Württemberg Hypo bonds and on a manner which worth can be been on the 2009 year stretching durations affects it. 
While Hypo is Real Estate bonds looked like a speculative investment alternative early, it is necessary to consider their of stable value one depending on the stability of the international financial system now the intensification of the bank crisis and on its trace, that the financial institution took the crisis to house quasi with Depfa receipt. 
Until all that, while the central banks, the governments and the less endangered business banks are inclined to the support of the system yet, till then the allowances it is possible to leave from his happening instalment onto a deadline. 
You are though ensues in what nobody dares to hope that he manages to overcome the monetary crisis in the following 15 months quasi currently. 
The partial one is bordering on nationalisation upon seeing coherent meanings but with the certainty probability by now merely legitimate hope tattered. 
The decision whether they should part with their investment may cause sleepless nights for the long-term creditors. 
The short-range investors may make use of the selling for it however, that the it to be come due course let a reserve be trained for taxes to be paid after the capital gains of years. 
Sylvana and the bentós the secrets of a box 
When 16 year Sylvana Hiltropnak are Tachibana Highschoolban has to introduce himself on his first school-day, the girls start giggling: The German chick is kavaí totally! 
What does this mean how? 
Sylvana the mangákból knows the word already - it tells a story about Japan in a new exchange student blog. 
The first is a school-day in Japan. 
I was anxious very much. 
Already in a road towards the school in I was catching fire. 
On Tokió szélén towards my lodge, Kavaszaki, and 40 minutes I travel with a train Tachibana Highschoolig. 
I had to find the way alone, I did not get lost fortunately. 
Is disappearing in that manner, that the beginning of the teaching Tachibanában it is not taken seriously, than at home, in Alsó-Szászország. 
The students from eight clocks they start leaking in while 8 clocks are short talks at the time of 40 begins with the teacher, the home room. 
But the row was on me before the teaching began, that introduce itself. 
I am not that type though, who speaks with pleasure, peoples, mainly before a class consisting of 40 students. 
Since he was not yet I put on an old skirt of my school uniform, my hostess, to it blouse, blue knee-high stockings and black leather shoes. 
I stood in this clothes so in front of the professorship, and I tried to drop everything correctly: Szajonara, vo Sylvana ... - Sylvanának call in, I came from Germany, and I will have the birthday after a week. 
I was very happy about two being good already in this moment I started learning the language eating. 
All 31 girls been whispering, was giggling and waved, and constantly the kavaí I heard a word. 
I knew this already the mangáimból. 
This belongs to the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary, and reports it, that sweet, sweet. 
I flitted onto my place quickly next. 
The girl sitting beside me smiled broadly, felt that the exchange student was seated beside it for honour. 
The remaining part of the clock was rather cool, but they attacked regularly when the bell began to sound. 
Everybody spoken at random and was chuckling, and a hole was bored into my stomach with their questions - though quite heavy to understand the Japaneses' English. 
Everybody undid it afterwards in the pause the bentóját. 
My host prepared a lunch like this for me - this totally other, than the the boring German snack sandwiches. 
I got spicy rice, little kolbászkákat, was made of a cucumber and an alga bundled up a lettuce, fruit and uniform one into tofu meat. 
The many times pale I do not have an idea of what I eat here in Japan. 
The foods look oddly, and they have a totally modern flavour. 
Fact, that everything very delicate. 
Back yes, possibly with the exception of the salty plum canned fruit, brrrr! 
The bentó is not only lunch simply in the Japanese schools. 
It occurs that a girl is own for a boy kezűleg prepared bentót gives presents, what he compiles especially artistically - in the hope that it may get acquainted with the boy in detail in a lunch break. 
From this direction the manga I read in my comic strips. 
I am curious about whether I may observe this here. 
Why just Japanese? - my girlfriends asked it when I told it to them that I would like to go to a school in Tokyo until a year. 
Always it I answered: 
Dared simply bewitches. 
Finally already since years the with pleasure mangákat I read. 
And I started studying sometime in Japanese in order to understand the comic strips and a culture written down in them better. 
Totally clear it was a back for me that I have to travel here sometime. 
With what feel drawn for the tradition and the customs. 
These consist in a big value here though. 
Japanese on the one hand the country of the newest techniques and trends - on the other hand though severe, disciplined and traditional. 
And myself even never found it lost since everything organized so well, yet if Tokyo is the largest city, which I saw in my life,. 
The rats have emotions. 
A rat or a moth escape in case of danger. Does this mean that he feels a fear? 
Joseph LeDoux neurologist scholar is keeping up with from him: The animals have emotions. 
But as what it would be possible to examine whether the same one is felt when they behave similarly to us? 
Edge famous scholars publish their articles since years in an Internet journal. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE one of his series Mi lasts for real one, without him being able to prove it? arrived from answers onto a question ogles. 
I believe in the fact that emotions and other consciousness states are at disposal of the animals, without you being me anybody else would have been able to prove this till now. Truth true, that we cannot prove that other peoples have consciousness. 
We may hope that the basis configuration of all human brains is identical at least however in this case. 
But as soon as we examine other races, and you are the perception we dissect the questions of the consciousness in generality, we come to ground which can be roamed difficultly, since the hardware does not tally. 
Makes the same one when a rat is in danger, than many other animals: Pretends to be dead, escapes or arises. 
The peoples behave on a similar manner, from which single researchers deduce comparable subjective experiences,. 
I do not believe in a dog however. 
The two aspects of the cerebral structure make it difficult in order for us to transmit our own subjective experiences to that of the animals. 
The electronic circuits being linked to the human consciousness contain it almost always on the one hand the side prefrontális cerebral cortex (in the short-range recollection and the execution one / his role played in management functions). 
This wide area in the man's case high more-developed, than at the rest of the primates, and it seems that somebody else is missing in the case of living beings in a full measure. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, that the prefrontális they depend on a cerebral cortex, for example the consciousness of who we are, you are probable in case of the planning and decision ability righteously, that the man differs even from the rest of the primates. 
An additional dramatic peculiarity resides in the man's lingual nature: It is claimed often since the considerable part of the human experience is connected with the language that the consciousness depends on this. 
In this case the animals can be excluded. 
But yet the language would influence it certainly if the consciousness would not depend on the language, so that let it be the animal consciousness, an one with an any kind of character, differs strongly presumably our consciousness states from most. 
Because of this difficultly verifiable, what the consciousness may be like in the case of the rest of the animals how. 
If the consciousness is not measurable as an inner and subjective thing, because of the special hardware though the basis of our own experiences cannot be analysed what do, him searching then poses serious troubles to us. 
Most of my explications concern the content of the conscious making ends meet, but an other aspect of the consciousness exists beside this, that for the science presumably more easily accessible. 
The consciousness processes of the animals their content truth without a look can be examined would be, and this happens in case of the experiments concerning the short-range recollection of the primates, especially in the example of visualizing punctually. 
They lean on the neural contexts of the consciousness rather in the course of assumption examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick for this however, than onto the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical, or neither. 
On an interesting manner this hypothesis the prefrontális emphasizes the significance of a cerebral cortex in the formation of visualizing. 
What follows from this regarding the emotions? 
I trace this back to it, that an emotional system, than that of the fear, his own activity in a brain in clear one activates. 
What we call a fear, it so the mental state in which we are then, when it is the activity of a defensive system localized in a brain (you are for it his consequences, for example the bodily reactions) occupies a work memory. 
The emotions are attached to those areas of the cerebral cortex tightly examined in this manner, that onto the primates and particularly onto the man typical. 
The perception divides up into delicate grades being supplemented with the lingual character, because we are able to distinguish states with the help of the words and the grammar and to categorise, that we write these down for others beside ourselves. 
Antonio Damasio is on that opinion for example opposite this, that the emotions the cerebral cortex and they derive from the plainer activities of the body perception areas of the brainstem, just as well than Jaak Pankseep, who it concentrates on a brainstem rather however. 
He may play a role in the emotions spanning the races easily since this network did not change very much during the human evolution. 
I cannot refute this theoretically purely, but I consider it one which cannot be proven. 
Pankseep some believes, that what seems a fear at the rats and the peoples, it is felt in both cases for it presumably: As what would it be possible to check whether the rats and the peoples feel the same one when they behave similarly? 
A cockroach escapes in case of the danger, he feels a fear? 
My opinion merely the similar behaviour yet not evidence onto the identical experience. 
Bar the neural one being similar helps long: for the rats and the peoples similar their brainstem, the cockroaches do not have a brain on the other hand. 
But the brainstem is responsible for the emotions? 
And yet if this would be provable in the peoples' concern: as what we could prove this in the case of the rats? 
I believe it, that for the rats and other mammals, but possibly even for the cockroaches (who knows it?) they have emotions. 
I do not know it however, how I shall prove this as what. 
And since their emotions differ fundamentally presumably the miénkéktől (since the human consciousness is special on electronic circuits and is based on the language), rather the emotional behaviour of the rats, than I research his emotional emotions. 
Whatever moving on this area promises on the neural level, in as much we measure the same one at the rats and the peoples. 
As I do not research the language and the consciousness in the case of the rats, some the emotions, since I do not know whether they exist. 
This may appear other to a myopic attitude, but I make progress rather, than that let me crash against a wall continuously. 
Since I am practical emocionalista. 
Platini, UEFA president: Of mercy time for Poland and Ukraine 
Ivan Vaszjunik a Ukrainian deputy prime minister announced that the preparations get under the president and the prime minister's direct responsibility shortly. 
The government UEFA bordeaux-i sowed confidence and its testimony into Ukraine in his decision sees that they believe in it, that it is capable of the organizing of an European championship together with Ukrajna Lengyelország - Vaszjunik said it. 
This does not mean amnesty to our country however. 
The work began only hardly, and in both countries a lot yet the agenda. 
The stadia, both hospitable countries are in lag regarding the building of roads, hotels and airports. 
Possible, that the dog stadia's number from eight it is reduced to six. 
We may not waste more time. 
We have to work with top speed now - Grigorij Szurkisz, Ukrán Labdarúgó Szövetség president said it. 
UEFA will keep its eye on us continuously. 
They were determined for an even more radical step in Poland. 
Nemzeti Olimpiai Bizottság Polish PZPN suspended an association's leadership following several scandals, that Robert Zawlocki independent commissioner keeping watch changed. 
Bizottság Miroslaw Drzewiecki assembled for a sports minister's initiation. 
There is his serious danger, that PZPN is able to be out of order according to the rules - made a statement to Drzewiecki Polish PAP for a news agency. 
We assured Michel Platinit, UEFA president that this will not affect the preparations of the 2012 dog negatively in a letter.

Indignant Dennis Quaid retorts 
The actress would have liked to advertise a new film, it talked about his privacy in an interview - and his trouble gathered now the was with his husband. Ryan hollywoodi a star classified his former husband, Dennis Quaidet as an adulterer. 
Who fumes - and retorts 
The war of overdue roses meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex at a couple: The two hollywoodi an actor fights a ugly fight with each other following their divorce with seven years - before the publicity. 
Ryan American InStyle made a statement about the reasons of the divorce to a journal first on the last week in a given interview: Dennis with what a lot caused pain was untrue to me for a long time. 
Found out how many women Dennis cheated on it with after the divorce only. 
Onto the spiritual striptease Ryan new, the women title row avoided because of his related press work with his film, which tells the story of an adultery,. 
Dennis Quaid responded to his proclamation happening for a unfaithful husband resolutely: Terrible - made a statement to the 54 year actors New York Daily News for a daily, - that Meg repeats it unceasingly and rewrites the story of our contact. 
Besides it unfortunate, that 16 year common boys, Jack is reminded of the many pains publicly repeatedly and onto the change, which the divorce causes for a child,. 
Quaid got married again while Ryan lives alone since the divorce, and a twin was his father recently.

The air-tickets and the prices of the hotel rooms decrease 
The European flights and the accomodations were cheaper in 2008 of his first half-years, than in the previous year. 
According to a current study in Germany the flights not less, than they were cheaper with 50 percentages. 
The prices of the flights and the hotel rooms were more favourable again - in this manner can be summed up American Express the result of one of a traveling and financial service provider's studies. 
The company the 2008. analysed his first biannual reservation data, and the second established a considerable crash in a quarter after the first quarterly price advance. 
After the prices rose to years on the hotel market, the accomodations a lot helyütt they became cheaper already. 
Between a January and a March the prices rose with 6,9 percentages compared to 2007 averagely in 41 from among the 48 examined European cities. 
3, 6 were lower prices with a percentage already however in the period reaching as far as a June because of the April can be experienced, than in the previous year. 
This trend appeared in Paris and Rome the most unambiguously, where the guests had to pay by 30-37 percentages less, than with a year early. 
American Express sees a reason for this in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which leaded to the American tourists' languorous traveling mood,. 
The decrease of the hotel room prices affects the financial centres, an example better Frankfurt or London, than the industrial towns, for example Hannover, Cologne you are Stavangert. 
The 26,3 percentile elevations of the hotel prices count as an European record in the Norwegian city. 
The change with the direction growing regarding the prices of the air-tickets appeared in the first quarter. 
Because of the rise in prices of the kerosene for the passengers the tourist an average was needed with 7,1 percentage more on a class to produce, than in 2007, the big fuel claim long-term flights increased in price by 29,2 percentages though. 
Between April and a June the tourist class the prices of air-tickets decreased compared to the previous quarter with 12,5 percentages averagely, the business and the prices showed a much more moderate change only however on the first class. 
The prices plummeted in an even bigger measure in Germany, than in other European countries. 
The prices rose by 11,9 percentages between a January and a March, you decrease by 23,6 percentages in the second quarter. 
The price of the Germany inland flights decreased to his half according to the study. 
The reason of the drop in prices resides in the lessening economic increase on the one hand - the company claims it. 
The demand weakened in several of the flight market's segments. 
Open Skies liberalize the air travels between USA and Europe on the other hand gets stronger as a result of an agreement by way of the competition practised pressure. 
The fact that the airlines delete their loss-yielding services justifies the tense situation, and a number airline was declared bankrupt in 2008 of his first half-years - this affects 24 airlines in Europe only. 
HSV 1:onto 0 Gladbachot beats it 
Hamburger SV got to the edge of the league table with a goal and plain methods. 
Borussiánál Luhukaynak does not manage to find the operational team in the future. 
Kristoffer Klein magnification contour flying the national one was fastidious on Marko Mari for him. 
The gladbachi got into a game on playful one being late only, and his increase rebounded from the goalpost. 
His message formulated punctually lost his lip convincingly. 
He knew that he has truth simply. 
We need the second goal - hissed Hermann Rieger on the corridor of the Hamburg arena driving to cabins. 
Not a lot happened on all of them in the catacombs, the pause understands an end, and most retained their place again. 
HSV was Rieger until nearly three decades fizikoterapeutája, bigger one rejoices at authority, than some former players. 
Asking him in this manner found hearing on the competent place. 
Cornelius Jol an assistant trainer nodded, and showed his thumb affirmatively. 
Cornelius is the Hamburg head coach, Martin Jol brother. 
His command may have sounded similarly: Here with the second goal! 
The execution of the command was canceled. 
The sight was not beautiful today always - later Marcell Jansen confessed it. 
Bastian Reinhardt imagined the thing more loosely. 
It 1: 0 (1: 0) goal result the Hamburg ones may say thank you for it to Mladen Petric bigwig (11.); and for the circumstance that the very weak one is gladbachiak the weak Hamburg ones were not able to be caused pain. 
A victory was dirty - Martin Jol summarized it. 
Hamburger SV will be 121 year one on a Monday now. 
The spectators already Saturday themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table appearing projectively were celebrated afternoon, that their team the championship osztályelsőjeként displayed it. 
This will be a birthday without a party. 
We know it, how we shall put the thing where - made a statement to Marcell Jansen. 
Suspects that the league is the intermediary certificate of the league table rather his unpredictability, than HSV signals his dominance. 
Although the team is committed on the one being late for his acquisitions - for the Brazilian renowned one and Silva:silva, the goalkeeper Petricnek and it FC Bayerntől got Jansennek - is himself slowly duly, but does not shine yet. 
We need more senses and dribbling - Jol demanded it.

A dark substance influences the flying of the space probes 
A mysterious phenomenon causes perplexity among the researchers since years. The dark substance influences the velocity of the space probes the so-called swing-by during a manoeuvre. 
The experts are afraid that Albert Einstein general relativity theory may not be sound in a full measure. 
Ulysses a space probe was flying until 18 years in the space close. 
The frost killing threatens it because of the fuel cables freezing up soon. 
A mysterious phenomenon, the swing cause chaos since years among the scholars-by anomaly. 
The swing-by means the gravitational swing manoeuvre of the space probes, in the course of which an implement is put onto additional impetus, a celestial body, for example in the gravitational space of the Earth. 
The probes may save a big amount of fuel in this manner. 
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe Ulysses used this physical trick for a day probe likewise similarly. 
What amazes the researchers since years already however: The flying objects they do not behave in a full measure the way his basis can be expected he would be. 
Abnormalities ensue in the velocity instead of this. 
The probes speed up unexpectedly or they slow down. 
The physicists did not find an explanation until all this onto this effect. 
The phenomenon swing-by it was named an anomaly. 
Some experts are afraid that even Albert Einstein general relativity theory may not be totally sound possibly, that the space perceives the gravity of the substance as his curvature. 
Stephen Adler American physicist, Princeton Institute for Advanced Study colleague believes in him habitually in the future, that Einstein was not out, and the swing-by anomaly tries to explain it by means of the so-called dark substance, that the spacemen in the universe discovered. 
The dark substance, which the Earth is entirely in his neighbourhood even possibly, may be responsible for the anomaly can be found, Adler writes it. 
From the existence of the dark substance only ten of the space researchers' years knowledge was obtained. 
He expounds gravity the effect of which has on the other celestial bodies is observable apparently. 
The substance himself emits any kind of electromagnetic radiation which cannot be seen totally however, light which can be seen chiefly or repulses. 
According to the scholars' calculations the universe is good for his full mass one fifth the darkness consists of a substance. 
The tourists stolen in Egypt broke out 
After ten days were spent stealing tourists carried off in his captivity, Egypt again free - the Italian foreign secretary confirmed it its views. 
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded more million Euro ransoms. 
Six hostage-takers lost his life supposedly in the gunfight preceding the hostages' release. 
Five German citizens were stolen in noon Egypt. 
The negotiations being about the ransom are going on already. 
Again and again Germans they turn into the kidnappers' target. 
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases. 
The European tourists carried off in Szahara are free. 
They reported on this unanimously the Egyptian state television, it Al-Arabija Arab TV channel and the Italian media. 
Italian Sky TG according to the reports of 24 television channels Franco Frattini an Italian foreign secretary confirmed the fact of the release: Our compatriots and the rest of the hostages were set free. 
We examine their health conditions currently - Frattini said it. 
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen, and eight of their Egyptian attendants they are in soundness and safety - informed the Egyptian state television. 
The desert expedition's 19 participants are on a road already supposedly into Cairo. 
The reasons of the gunfight before setting the hostages free are shrouded in mystery in the future: The hostage-takers showed some inclination to the hostages' release when the Sudanese army destroyed it unexpectedly already according to an Egyptian safety clerk's account hatukat. 
The problem was resolved. 
The ransom was accepted - the clerk said it. 
The negotiation was about the hostages' receipt when the surprise ensued suddenly only already. 
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on the borderland between Sudan, Csád and Egypt on Sunday, two were arrested though. 
The hostage-takers demanded ransom with a sum of six million euros of Germany; the German wife of one of the hostages should have handed over the money. 
It "al-Maszri al-Jom" daily reported from that direction referring to a German mediator, that the hostages' release drags on because the kidnappers are worried about their own soundness. 
The hostage-takers set the female hostages free following the payment of the ransom according to the meaning. 
The kidnappers detain the men while a safe escape route is not found. 
The Cairo German embassy was not willing to take a stand on the meaning. 
The stepfather violence leaded to a suicide 
It was reported on the court that a woman is a Latvian suicide because his stepfather was agressive with him through years. 
Cornwall a living person, 57 year Michael Trerise spent 6 years in a prison in county Stithians parish, after nyolcrendbeli made confession violent genital one from the experiment of publishing. 
The truroi a criminal court discovered that he bound his stepdaughter, Stephanie regularly Randle-t it five- and his seven-year age. 
Trerise wrote this in one of his statements: I feel a responsible for his death. 
It was reported on the negotiation that Randle is 34 on year one, Plymouth city in Mutley quarter being a suicide, the 2007. were Aprils in his home on 1. 
When Coventry-ben lived as a child, Trerise bound it and tied up his eye before the coitus while his mother worked in a pub. 
Trerise separated from his wife in the 1980 years, and Cornwallt elected it as his residence again. 
His stepdaughter Plymouth-ba moved. 
It lightened up in the course of the judicial process however, that Randle miss, who National Trust spent much time as a volunteer at an of protection of historic buildings organization, the phantoms of the violence being repeated two times weekly pursued it. 
In 2006 Ramsey Quaife a prosecutor told it to the court that Randle is a miss, who liked to windsurf passionately early, and to bike, his friends emotional dead person and renounced the life. 
His father, Terrance Randle found it in his 2007. April dead the plymouth-i his flat. 
He strangled himself with a bag presumably. 
Randle a lord was in conflict with his daughter's stepfather, who finished his statement in this manner in a letter,: I bound it always and I tied up his eye. 
I did not harass it sexually. 
Myself find it responsible for his death. 
Christopher Elwen a judge related it Trerise-nek: You exceptionally strange fetisist, and sure, that this was terrible for his victim, particularly, if only seven were year. 
This unpleasant saga ended with it, that the victim was suicidal. 
Yet elgondolkodtatóbb but the fact that the case would never have got in front of a court possibly if he does not do so. 
The judge added it to it: I call attention to a what kind of effect the crime committed by Ön had on their girl in the course of the years according to Stephanie's parents. 
A hopeful, successful and happy young person would have been a woman presumably if this does not occur. 
The official losing the important data was indicted 
The government officer who left secret documents on a train in a June strictly is accused of the violation of an official secret according to BBC's informations. 
The man was the of national defence one in an expert mission from a ministry, when two left a secret document strictly single Waterlooba on a lasting train. 
The documents were sent to BBC before they were conveyed to the police. 
This law is connected to his contravention mildest charge, and there is not the suspicion of the deliberate commission. 
Franc the step surprised many people according to Gardner, BBC's correspondent ordered to an of national defence ministry Whitehallban. 
It was thought that the of national defence ministry and the government will handle the case as an inner case - said it. 
The employee, who cannot be designated, it was indicted based on the 8.1. dot of the law. This paragraph is about the conservation of the information. 
The state public prosecutor's department suggested it, that let Metropolitan Police represent the charge brought up against the official the man the unified intelligence one is related to a commission, his quite sensitive natured work. 
The documents lost by it implied related, secret surveys with al-Kaida and the Iraqi army's abilities. 
It was informed about the decision on a Monday, it was moved onto unknown place from his home then. 
The home building cooperatives pay it B&#x26;B account 
Great Britain's home building cooperatives may count on 80 accounts with a sum being over a million English pounds Bradford &#x26; Bingley after a bank's rescue. 
The government 2, 6 million account holders spent 14 billion pounds Bradford &#x26; Bingley-onto the protection of the seated deposits of nél. 
All of the firms that make use of the deposit proprietors' money will pay the interests of the loan to this, between them 59 home building cooperatives. 
The home building cooperatives his association (BSA) his president, Adrian Coles annoying, that the companies and their members have to pay. 
Onto the refund of the 14 billion important loans finally Bradford &#x26; a row is found following the repayment of Bingley mortgages then. 
Interest accumulating in the interval however annually burden onto the 700 financial companies that make use of the loans. 
BBC's Pénzügyi Szolgáltatások Kártalanítási Rendszer confirmed that it is 59 home building cooperative between them owes. 
Annoying, that for the institutions intervening cautiously till now ... it is necessary to pay the accounts of those institutions now, that they were cautious less with good one. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
We discovered that all companies have to pay in a proportion like that, the size he is in possession of a deposit sum. The companies between each other the expenses 18%-án share. 
The sum of the credit attains the 450 million pounds in 2009 according to ministry's of Finance estimates. 
This means that the companies have to save up 81 million pounds for the payment of the first yearly interests. 
Adrian Coles, BBC's director-general told it to the home building companies' trade union that he considers the measure unfair one. 
Outrageous, that less cautious institutions' accounts have to be paid to the institutions that intervened cautiously with the good one the home-building market's upswing his time. 
One single company got not ruined since their function was started in 1945 according to BSA. 
We have to consider this case from every angle in the following few weeks it, that let us decide it, how we may protect the home building companies and their members from the account with a considerable sum, - Cole added it to him. 
The a due interest covers 7 months in 2009 this year because of the end of a September until the end of a March. 
It is necessary to pay a full yearly interest, which may be his current double even, then in 2010. 
Since the home building cooperatives are mutual aid organisations, shareholders, the account has to be paid to the members then finally, even through the taller prizes, lower interests received after their deposits even. 
The price of the milk litre five rise by a penny 
Jersey-ben the peoples have to pay more for the milk. 
The Jersey-i a milk industry company announced that he raises the wholesale price of the milk with another five pence because of a Monday litre.

The application of the earlier parliamentarian representative of Bangladesh was rejected in order to be allowed to defend himself at large 
The Bangladeshi court rejected the previous parliamentarian representative's, Sheikh stomach sinew's application for defence happening at large, what means that it may be arrested when he returns into the country. 
His lawyer related that the court denied him the defence happening on the release in connection with that charge, that on his parliamentarian agency's time from a businessman 50 million extorted takát (729,700 dollars). 
This case only an from among the numberless, corruption charges brought up against it. 
Sheikh the old political adversary of his stomach sinew, Khaleda Zia was set free in this month in return for bail. 
Sheikh stomach sinew has to return in the following few weeks into Bangladesh, his party, Awami League demands it however, that let the country's temporary government favoured by an army provide a full freedom to him first. 
According to the reports, although it was placed on conditional release in order to be allowed to go abroad onto a cure, the free foot does not emerge from place conditions unambiguously, that may keep his freedom when he returns into the country. 
His lawyers say that the Court of Appeal will appeal against his decision on the Supreme Court now. 
The Court of Appeal Sheikh rejected the application of his stomach sinew for bail on the grounds that he is not onto him need, since it was placed on free foot temporarily already, and attends a foreign country cure, - we found it out Rafique-ul Huq from a lawyer. 
We will appeal against the Court's of Appeal decision. 
He has need because of that on the release according to his lawyers' argumentations truth onto defence, that let him be allowed to return into the country, and let him be allowed to get ready for the December choices. 
Awami League one of a party's leaders related that Sheikh stomach sinew is October expectedly after 17 on Sunday returns home. 
It was seized after the temporary government favoured by the army took over the power last year, but it was let out from the prison in order to be allowed to go abroad in a June onto a cure. 
Sheikh stomach sinew and Khaleda Zia both of them deny all charges brought up against them. 
Concerns in connection with the vaccination program against the Afghanistani polio

BSkyB bought his share in 2006, and it prevented it efficiently with this NTL-t - that since then rename for Virgin Media - in #ITV'S purchasing. 
Versenyhivatal reported it in 2007 of his Aprils, that by way of BSkyB it ITV-ből a bought share jeopardizes #ITV'S independence, motivating Versenyjogi Bizottság to initiate an investigation. 
Virgin headmaster, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom supervision all of them opposed the acquisition. 
BSkyB argued with it, that the forced reduction of that of a #ITV share meaningless and disproportionate redress - with a strange look in that direction, that BSkyB it made a statement to, would be willing to give up his vote. 
The newer examination of the American public prosecutors' case 
USA's attorney general nine USAs appointed a special prosecutor public prosecutor 2006 onto the examination of firing him. 
The step followed it, that by way of the inspector general of the forensic wallet from the case a prepared report criticized the governmental clerks' decisions. 
The report criticized the White House's clerks, the lawmakers and the previous attorney general, Alberto Gonzalest. 
The examination was ordered because it was fearing that the public prosecutors were fired from a political consideration. 
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor will investigate whether the clerks listened to in the course of the investigation tried to obstruct the course of justice with a lie now. 
The serious charges concerning the possible crime were not investigated yet, and it was not cleared up - Glenn Fine, an inspector general claimed it. 
It was the proposal of one of the heads in order for a special prosecutor, in whose power obliging the witnesses to a statement is, to be appointed. 
The series began with USA's forensic wallet having removed nine public prosecutors from his arrangement in 2006 of his Decembers. 
It was said in those days that the public prosecutors were dismissed because of their weak performance. 
It turned out later however that the fired public prosecutors received worse assessment with nothing, than many of their other colleagues. The fact that a political consideration lay behind the dismissals brought many people to that inference because of this. 
Some public prosecutors took a part in high-ranking Republican congressmen's criminal action, while others were not willing to take a part in the examination of related charges with the electoral fraud brought up against the democrats. 
The American public prosecutors from the government's commission investigation is made and court cases are conducted. 
Any time can be fired, but from a political reason cannot be removed their position. 
The then leader of the forensic wallet, Alberto Gonzales an attorney general became the target of attacks the firing, and resigned finally. 
The number other officer of the forensic wallet handed in his resignation likewise. 
The inspector general criticized Gonzales role played in the case largely in his report. The attorney general bears a primary responsibility for the dismissals according to it, from the role of a canceled leader, and backed out of the process markedly. 
Other officers - including Karl Rove-ot, elder Bush's previous helper - it criticizes, how cooperation was not attested in the course of the examination. 
Meat Loaf epic receives an acknowledgement 
The rock star Meat Loaf Q Awards will receive an acknowledgement on a prize-giving gala Bat Out Of Hell title his epic anthem. 
The singer, who receives his special prize with a gold grade on a coming week on the London feast, said it, considers the acknowledgement honour. 
The nine minutes, a song with a longitude of fifty-five seconds were the title songs of Meat Loaf 1977, album being a hit. 
Coldplay got most nominations for the this year's prizes, they got to the list of candidates in four categories. 
Paul Rees, Q a magazine's general editor related it: There are some songs that cross the borders of the time or the genres, and Bat Out Of Hell so. 
The song obtained by Jim Steinman demanded a very big sound, and this sound was Meat Loafé. 
The song an almost two began with a minute instrumental section. 
Appeared in 1979 as a single, and the 15. managed to reach place on the hit lists. 
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell title his album was present through nine years on the hit lists almost, and afterwards more than 40 million copies were sold from him. 
Meat Loaf - his real name Marvin Lee Aday - fights hygienic problems recently. He went through operation after he collapsed on the stage because of his heart arrythmia between many people, in 2003. 
He had to cancel some concerts because of an acute laryngitis in 2007. 
It lightened up later, that cyst can be found his vocal cord. 
Unknown metropolitan street, which they forget often,, and it is sold soon possibly 
New York City-more thousand of the avenues of nek, the by-road of his boulevard and somebody else are. Some from among them famous, others fulfill a practical function merely. 
Many skilled cab drivers and a local resident living here for a long time would be able to tell it difficultly however, where can be found Extra Place, mostly because they never heard about him yet. 
The small street East Village-there is ben, and the first is heading towards north from a street - anélkül, that would reach up to the second street - between Bowery and the second avenue. 
Cca. 9 m wide and 36 m long, and resembles a dusty alley rather with a shock, than onto a capital traffic route. 
There are not street signs. 
It is not possible to find it practically on a standard map. 
The street has admirers however. 
Is there, for example, Avalon Bay, the first street one was being built recently luxury buildings having built. 
Wants it again to wrap the extra Place-t, and would like to assure it that it is new into the businesses of buildings and let it be possible to get on a clearer road into his boutiques. 
Between the street's admirers owe the neighbours living here for a long time, on who it had influence in the mangled street,, that this was the only residue from the past of the neighbourhood preceding renovations. 
But for the street's proprietor, the city building conservation and -fejlesztési insisting on him is not in his interest for his class. 
In this month, on a seat of the district local government's area treatment commission the city and Avalon Bay representatives introduced a proposal like that, according to which it having built would bribe the street. 
The commission would like it better however, if the street would stay in the city's treatment, and asked the submission of a new plan onto a coming month, Susan Stetzer gave an account, the district leader of the 3. No. municipal body. 
The city is in possession of very few areas already, and we would love if Extra Place is the city's in the future would be left over, - said it. 
Proposals concerning his renovation and his treatment that Avalon may make may come up, but we would like to guarantee it, that available let him be left for the publicity. 
Avalon Bay announced that he wants it again before with some months to wrap the little street, and would like to supply it with seats. These a cafe would use a part of his, for which it having built leases an area then expectedly. 
The idea, that Avalon Bay would bribe the street, it was made public on the this month's seat first. 
Michele but Milly, Avalon Bay spokesman related that he does not insist on his possession although the company would like to use the street. 
Avalon Bay principal viewpoint it, that let him resume this the got worn out alley, and let him turn it into a pleasant public place - made a statement to, adding to it that the city suggested his purchasing. 
Seth Donlin, the building conservation office's spokesman related that the city would have liked to sell the street really, and observed that the office's task is the development of the buildings, and not his treatment. 
His more coloured neighbour, the Bowery-hez Extra Place does not have much historical significance. 
Néhányak received it in 1802 the nobody's land name, when Philip Minthorne big possession was divided up among his numberless child, and nobody laid claim to the narrow stripof land. 
The punk rock closed in 2006 an ancient monument's, CBGB rear exit the Extra Place re opened, and the street possibly from that direction the most remarkable one, that Ramones Rocket prepared there to Russia title on the cover of his album character photograph. 
A site was superb - Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photograph in 1976 of his November, said it. 
He had a winter with garbage, dress shreds, barrel and with poster pieces, and with a leaf and ropes. 
Between some inhabitants, many people bloggers, how bought who write about it his possession the middle class East Village-et, Extra Place selling is opposed. They argue with it, that for this piece of the collective property, any kind of modest one, the community are needed in his possession to leave over. 
Others the extra Place-t than curio it is mentioned, that the city an his scrap was left invariably practically, and that it is necessary to leave it in peace. 
Jeremiah Mos, Jeremiás vanishing New York title (the book of lamentations: the bitter nostalgia contemplating the process of the city's extinction subtitle) blog írója feltette blogjára annak the extra Place-ről a part of a sounding story, which The New Yorker is, title weekly paper urban rumour title appeared in his heading in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill wrote this: Extra Place a narrow, small dead end, which is dark even daytime,, that rusty, depository doors and window-shutter windows were made of iron border, and where the edge carries one-week's newspapers in the channels. 
The street, disregarding some exceptions, some looked in the same manner with an evening before. 
A rat ran across on the street's end, beside the back door, that once the CBGB-in drove, belongs to a upmarket clothing shop developed on his place though now. 
There was a graffiti on the walls, and an empty one, 0,75 litre ones söröspalack lay beside a fresh newsprint heap thrown away. 
Some passers-by related that they remember Extra Place rarely, but it is believed in that manner, it would need the renovation. 
Fields related that some people underestimate his attractiveness practised in the street's present state according to it. 
I spent the most beautiful years of my life on dark, damp and disgusting places - said it. 
Debate from the bilingual education: Continuous kitettség for the English lingual environment 
The education watcher this part of his Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the candidates from bilingual education his represented opinion is discussed. 
Lance T. Izumi, who is the experienced researcher of the California studies in the Pacific alley politics research institute, and the driving headmaster of the education research, Nem good one how Ön believes it: Why the middle class needs a school choice opportunity title the co-author of a book. 
Not to curry favour with easy voters coming from the areas with a Spanish language. 
Peach Obama is related to education his proposals here owe. 
The students with an Afro-Amerikan and Spanish lip obtain a diploma with a significantly smaller probability according to Obama campaign, than the white students, and this true. 
Obama educational plan positively supports it in the interest of overcoming the so performance differences - between many people - the transitional bilingual education the English for students. 
At the same time, for Obama the question that the bilingual one is his commitment for education, that lays the emphasis on the school education not happening on an English language, overcomes the interest of truth in overcoming the high performance differences. 
Let us buy it for example Sixth Street Prep contractual primary school on Los Angeles county eastern part. 
The big part of the school's students with low income with a Spanish lip. 
The students more than one third - from among who many people arrived recently - learns the English language. 
Despite this the fourth class 100%-a understands a distinguished result on the 2008 state mathematics exam. 
Similarly fascinating, that the fourth class 93%-a the English language and literature performed excellently on an exam. 
This incredible performance was not achieved with the device that Obama would prefer. 
Sixth Street onto the repetition, lays the emphasis on the practice, the continuous assessment of the skills and the rejection of the objections. 
Besides, and this it, that Obamának should take it into consideration, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street headmaster, the school's educational principle the immersion of the students studying in English with a full measure into the lingual environment. 
The essence of the immersion method the English language quasi his sole usage in the course of the teaching of the rest of the objects. 
Mikels, who opposes the bilingual education, related it: we had an overwhelming success in it, that would not notice it if somebody would walk into a classroom, who the student who arrived newly from Mexico before it with 12 months was. 
Works - established it -, works for us. 
Whether Obama the others, a considerable No. one with a Spanish lip would claim it as example to follow and in front of a school teaching a student studying in English the schools like that, than Sixth Street Prep? 
The results attained by the school should make the answer unambiguous, but because of his own party's educational policy (the national educational one associations favour the bilingual education for a long time), and we may not be sure of Obama reaction since himself stands by the bilingual education consistently. 
A bar agrees in it, that they have to train to be the immigrants in English, Obama recently lebecsülően made a statement about the question, when he said that the peoples should not be worried so much the legislation exclusively his English nature. 
Instead of this, said it, their children should be got to speak in Spanish. 
How the differences should decrease between the results if Obama would really like to reach it, should study the models that work instead of him disdaining it sincerely and would ignore them. 
With the economy related, broke out anew the price of the oil fell steeply because of concerns 
The oil prices fell steeply because of concerns like that on a Monday, that the rescue operation plan of America concerning financial markets will be unable to refreshen it the economy. 
The stocks of the crude oil regressed to 99,80 dollars with seven percentages in the morning on New York-i Kereskedelmi Tőzsde. 
The prices more than you decrease by 20 dollars barrel went by since a Monday. 
Wall made the commodity exchanges sway in the past fortnight Street-i financial chaos, and some vigourous hurricanes in Gulf of Mexico. 
After the prices attained the 145,29 dollars in a July barrel, this one wearing on the front of a month they regressed to almost 90 dollars, before the financial markets would have got under the effect of his immeasurable insecurity again. 
The concern seized the investors after the congress's leaders announced it again on a Monday: they managed to tally on the weekend regarding the economic rescue operation, which counts as the largest one until now in the history,. 
The concerns sowed a shade onto the news, that the monetary crisis will not be over for a long time yet. 
Citigroup will buy up Wachovia Corporation bank branch as the recent event of the developing crisis, the government announced it on a Monday. 
The Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate partly meanwhile, the Fortis-t. 
Barclays are disappearing in that manner as the consequence of the desperate weekend negotiations according to Capital analysts, he did not manage to refreshen it with the rescue operation the stock exchange trading mood. 
As the economic situation, expected one is deteriorating, that the commodities - for example the oil - demand will decrease likewise. 
The future of the market of the ordinary shares, the interest rates and the foreign exchange rates became vague worldwide - an analyst of Deutsche Bank wrote it to the investors. 
We reckon that he does not avoid the market of the commodities then away the epidemic. 
It is the largest question from the viewpoint of the commodity exchange in a what kind of measure USA's illness infects all of the world, strange one in consideration of China. 
The banks' analysts cut their waitings concerning the coming year down as the oil consumption decreased because of the deceleration of the economic increase, 20%-kal reduced the oil and their forecasts admonishing 2009 concerning gas prices. 
The team set his record with the feat of the second quarter 
After more are the past one than eight spent more time in Jets shirt in a season, than anybody else, the defensive end Shaun playing in a position Ellis believed it, saw everything already. 
But a Sunday looked at the development of the second quarter when Jets transformed a game without a dot into a sensational match next. 
I never saw one like this yet, - said it Ellis. 
The second quarter was beginning after Jets and Arizona Cardinals half-hearted game got into full harmony on the sky with towering, dark clouds. 
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yard touchdown-passzt given Laveranues Colesnak. This was the perfect forerunner of an afternoon in the course of which their developing cooperation improved significantly. 
Favre yet two touchdowns-passzt given Colesnak in this quarter, between many people then, when two cornerback fell with 10 seconds before the end of the half-time after each other. 
I was not sorry for the effort - Favre said it about the given pass of all Colesnak. 
Infernal good player. 
We were able to communicate with each other, independently well till now it, what the peoples believe. 
While Favre and Coles they played with a ball, the protection stopped Cardinals leader, Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis playing in a position caught a bad throw, and 32 rejected it with a yard, which is touchdownt, understands. 
Eric Smith, safety a player reached into an other pass, and stole the ball. 
David Bowens, linebackernek succeeded to knock out from Warner's hand the ball. 
This last turn could have been the most astonishing moment on the match. 
But when Cardinals lost the ball before his end with 10 seconds, and Jets got it, Jay Feely 20-yard field shot a goal, portrayed with this the 34:0-digs a result. 
This was the best result, which Jets understands inside a quarter till now,. 
Sounded in this manner when they asked Jets trainer, Eric Manginit to characterize the fascinating character of the game: You are the second the third quarter? 
When it was called him, that both - Cardinals obtained 21 dots in that manner in the third quarter, that Jets did not obtain one - Mangini related it: I have to relate that I enjoyed the second quarter much better, than the third. 
We obtained very many dots under short time. 
The recovered Gebrselassie disproves his own world record 
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie showed it again, how many people keep it why the best middle lived once and for a long-distance runner, when a Sunday disproved his own world record in Berlin. He was the first one with this, who 2 clocks ran the 42,2 kilometres under 4 minutes. 
The comfortably plane on an orbit, 2:03:Gebrselassie repaired 27 seconds with a victory attained under 59 time 2:04:his 26 earlier result, which a last year attained in Berlin,. 
Gebrselassie put the 26. world record of his career on a diverse area like that onto 35 of his year ages, that everything gained a world championship at a distance quasi until the marathon because of the 1500 metres, or attained a world record. 
Gebrselassie omitted the Pekinese Olimpic marathon being afraid of it in a past month - that in this manner looking back proved to be carefulness exaggerated possibly - that the air pollution would aggravate his asthmatic problems long. 
He entered for the Berlin marathon instead of this. 
Almost between perfect circumstances - in sunny time, beginning in 9 °C, on his end though in 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes with 56 second kilometre velocities. 
Since the runners not entering the marathon early, Than pl. Gebrselassie, and Kenyan Paul Tergat the longer distances turned towards it, the marathon record more than decreased by two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo is the Brazilian one da Costa in 1998 2:06:05-es in Berlin won by a result. 
Gebrselassie told it to the reporters after the Sunday victory that his two calves were seized with a cramp before with a fortnight, and was not able to train until a fortnight. 
Obvious, that was refreshed under the compulsory halt, and not got rusty. 
I am glad so much - Gebrselassie called it the reporters. 
Everything developed perfectly. 
I started training for new one before with a week, and I had doubts today, but there was everything properly finally. 
Received some criticisms - from particularly Kenya, from the East-African rival of Ethiopia - that uses too many appliances in the course of his competitions, keeps clear of a marathon runner with much worldwide fame generally, relies on his pace runners in that manner, as if would run on an orbit, and the competitive spirit prefers the world records to it. 
This criticism reduces Gebrselassie greatness hardly in the long-distance running however. 
Gebrselassie on Sunday with the collaboration of four Kenyan pace runners 1:02:attained the midpoint under 04. 
Two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi granted the rhythm Gebrselassie-nak, after the pace runners got tired. 
Not much more, than Gebrselassie outruned it with a last sprint before the aim with 4,8 kilometres Kwambai-t, who reached the goal as the second 2:05:repaired with 36,5 minutes individual legjobbján. 
Kamathi arrived as the third 2:07:under 48. 
In the female competition Irina Mikitenko with a Kazakhstani birth, who is a German citizen now,, the seventh fastest one, 2 ended a notable year:19:his 19 victory. 
The world record the British Paula Radcliffe keeps it 2:15:with 25 time. 
36 year Mikitenko had enough a past spring for a surprise harvested on the London marathon 2:24:with a 14 result. 
May not have attended the Pekinese Olympic Games because of his alleged back injury, healed quickly however, and won the Berlin marathon where he repaired on his individual peak with five minutes. This was the third marathon long-distance running, which he attended,. 
Won the competition with a clever calculation: allowed it first, that Ethiopian and Kenyans an let four of his head groups forge ahead, and let him put an implement onto considerable leadership, then cca. 30 km of his running down after them arisen. 
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa 2 reached the goal as the second:with 21.31 time, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop was the third 2:25:with a 01 result. 
A separating city's, the coffees' pride and his trials 
In the experience park extending in Greater Orlandó - onto some miles what glitters is noisy with everything and huge - a quiet small town hides where the Afro-American is the pride of a life experience and his complication you are born. 
Eatonville, the first one like that purely black city, that integrated into the country, and that Zora Neale Hurston was his childhood home, today already not plain one like the one for which he wrote it down in 1935: the five lakes, three croquet grounds, 300 brown leathers, 300 good swimmers, many guavas and without the city of two schools, a prison. 
Now already place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, on Toni Morris and Ruby Dee had been already on the Zora festival organized annually. The eatonville-i series of festivities the Harlem-reneszánsz for his most famous women's author, Hurstonnek his respect it is kept. 
After all, from many viewpoints the city made a tourist site written down by it - that by way of the Szövetségi Íróinak Projekt of the crisis era published floridai figures in a guidebook - separates from his environment. 
Just as independent, majestic and locking himself up, than it was 1930 in years when Hurston is a writing of his the floridai, urban coffees were not willing to share their real thoughts with the white peoples, who know so little about us, often, how it is not known, what they miss. 
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama overlooked talks promises the racial question in a contact, many people are suspicious of the outsiders' glances here. 
We keep an eye on it very much, how our story is related - 59 year Hortense Jones gave an account, who lived here in his whole life, and the member of the city's oldest church. 
It is necessary to relate it correctly. 
Eatonville-t the victory and the fight characterize it with his paradox for a long time. 
Simultaneously the model of the coffees' projection with historical significance, at the same time an one like that almost 2400 head communities, where the poverty indicators attain it the national average dupláját. 
Partly literary junction, an example came into existence as the result of the American slave-holding though partly, looked down sometimes, sometimes praised, noon, onto a urban, black culture, which blooms in the shade of the oak trees,. 
Not surprising so, that the local inhabitants are proud of one and defensive. 
It Eatonville-ről picture worked up though since Zora important, (everybody calls it in this manner here Hurstont). 
In the books written in the honest, strong dialect - than Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) - presented his hometown to the world. 
The floridai the five paragraphs of a guidebook changed the city, which lies beside the 17 road,. This road drives from Florida centre forgotten once onto one of the sites of the coffees' history and the human dramas. 
Hurston, who was brave equally in the life and the literature,, even the drumbeat, introduced his readers into Eatonville first mayor's, Joe Clarke business, looked in into the more confidential spheres then. 
Wrote in this manner: From the road right we hit the modern public school, brown one on a basis with white yards kept with an edge, carefully properly és játszóterekkel, that Howard Miller edits, although he can write hardly and to read. 
The widow mentioned Dash new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn sells an all kinds of beverage, and anything, onto which there may be need on the transitional accomodations. 
Hurston brought it into a context in some hundred words in this manner Eatonville-t with the autonomy, but at the same time with the illiteracy, the remarriage and the sex. 
Unambiguous, that Fodor's a guidebook introduced it as something else. 
Everybody did not like this description really. 
Zora related the things the way - 90 year Ella Dinkins, one Johnsons gave an account girl. Hurston made them immortal with it, how quoted from the obscene songs, which the men sang about their beauty,. 
Added it to it: Some men did not like this. 
Hurstonra they remember in that manner always yet here, than onto the living eccentric, who visited home often,, after his family the floridai Jacksonville-in moved. 
77 year Augustus Franklin recalled it, that when Hurston stormed into the city, arrived without an announcement in single rumbling Chevrolet generally, smoking, and in a trousers into a city like that, where the peoples are proud of their majestic dressing even today. 
Most men spellbound, Franklin said it, but many people belittled it. 
The peoples were glad always if it may have been seen Zorát, - Franklin told it. 
But Sabelia on a terrace looking out on a lake, where Hurstont is largest with a probability it was baptized, added it to it swinging in his chair: He was never left over too for a long time. 
Was poor when Hurston died in 1960, and his books were not spent on new one already. 
It seemed that Eatonville forgot about him together with the world's big part. 
Although an author was popular once, Langston Hughes contemporary, and the only coffee is growing in the 1920 years on Barnard Főiskola, it was buried into a nameless grave the floridai Fort Pierce-ben, where he lived before it. 
Eatonville-ben there were not considerable commemorations, or big, public readings. 
I do not believe in the fact that it was understood, how much enriched the world with, or what let us have our way about altogether how - Valerie Boyd, the Hurston biography given out in 2003 said it, wrapped in the rainbow title the author of a book. 
The turning point came in 1980. 
Orange county clerks five a lane road wanted to be built up through the city instead of the two-lane high street, Kennedy sugárút, for which he played an important role in the community's life. 
Expansive Orlandó Interstate joining the states crept in with 4 motorways on the city's western border in this manner already. 
The proposal came when Eatonville was recovering yet after a heavy historical period. 
The forced integration ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation between many people. 
Related fights made the community taste the hatred with the racial mixing in the 1950 years. 
A team came round in those days white boy, and it was pelted on the edge of the road sitters with an orange and other things - Franklin told it. 
There was a lady who died of this. 
A watermelon was thrown out from a car. 
An in 1955 The Orlando Sentinel title Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision prescribing violent integration in his letter written to a sheet. Brown made a statement in this manner v. Board of Education name from a decision: offends it rather, rather than has respect for my race. 
The residents say that the schools' desegregation was positive in some looks though today, the eatonville weakened it-the solidarity of iek, and ruined the young persons' self-confidence. 
The black children got used to the fact that they are hugged - I remember this - the man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening - N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins daughter gave an account, Őrizzük meg Eatonville Közösség name a non-profit organisation's Managing Director. 
This lasted while the students and the teachers came from common place - added it to it. 
We did not hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - there were cultural differences between us for me in that manner - Nathiri said it. 
The human rights helped with the rise of much other Zora Neale Hurston however - in so black authors', actors' and artists', who rose above the prejudices as he is his act, optimistic one like that with self-confidence and rows, than the successor: How anybody should be able to divest himself of my company's delight. 
This is incomprehensible for me. 
Alice Walker pilgrimized away to Hurston nameless grave in 1975, and started struggling for the fact that he should give back his fame. 
Acknowledged Hurston written by avoided a Robert E. Hemenway onto the bookshops' shelves later with five years biography, that again between the ideals of America raised it. 
The road-building project would have started when Eatonville most famous girl became the centre of attention again just. 
And this Hurston old neighbours considered him a rescuer with an occasion. 
The community started organizing a Hurston festival in order to show it in 1988, we what the county would ruin with his main road. 
More thousand fans came to a later opening event with the two years, and many people return onto the feast in all Januaries since then. 
The county forewent his road-building proposal later with quite a few years. 
The main road five the community revived because of his lane, civil one fastened onto full speed, which is real, reports pride - Nathiri said it. 
Boyd formulated it more simply: Zora saved it Eatonville-t. 
A victory was a hit above the road-building project the city helped from himself in the alteration of his developed picture. 
Living persons appeared in my increasingly bigger mouth apart from the city, Than pl. Rachelle Munson lawyer, who started going in 1993 here, into a church, and the local ones started reinterpreting the past. 
Eatonville got into the national historical register in 1998. 
The new one, one-storeyed one opened in 2006 (naturally Hurston-ről named) library, it wrapped and embellished on Kennedy sugárúton. 
Eatonville Florida odd one out was left in the future: not entirely ten km Orlando is only his centre, but the man has a feeling like that sometimes, as if there would be a suburban side street on his summer falling time; so small, when 27 black families founded it in the 1880 years. 
(Today the residents 90%-a coffee.) 
The outsiders, who arrive here looking for Eatonville story, his message, are received with carefulness always yet. 
To most interviews preliminary permit necessary, and some things - than for example Eatonville oldest fresco, that a white man depicts painted and coffees working on the lands - it is not allowed to take a photo of it. 
Eatonville-ben many people - between many people confident Jones woman teacher, who feels drawn towards the active red one especially - they are afraid that their separating community is misunderstood. 
And after all, as the Hurston festival is the pride of a Latvian with an increasingly wider circle, the hometown grown increased. 
The young persons look at one in that manner rather especially Eatonville re, as Hurston saw his own race: for wonderful one, with his problems and together with everything for right, neither for worse one, for proud one just like that, for creative one, for diligent one, for a fool and for disturbed one, than the rest of the racial one and ethnic group in America. 
Honest civil bond sounds who for Franklin nephew, 18 year Edwins Harvey-nek his words, who plans it in such a way that he recurs after the college's accomplishment, that at the local local government, you are at the police let him undertake work, that they are in dire need of the help according to it. 
And is disappearing in that manner, the younger ones learned to characterize it correctly Eatonville-t, than for example 11 year Winter Park-i twins: Alondra and Alexia Kenon. 
Most believe who travel here only in that manner, that this city nothing compared to the others - Alondra Kenon said it recently after the church service on a Sunday. 
But if somebody stops and this earmarks a little time for recognizing his history then a very beautiful city. 
We here in New York all of them we speak the language of the financial affairs 
Nothing changed on the surface. 
If the tourists would not get broken the newsagent with huts and the huge one televízióprojecting on Times Square, it would not be noticed, that they depend on the very centre of a storm. 
They would never realize that the bankers are the glass-fronted one, beehives with shaped offices above their head and kockázatialap-treating, who keep New York in their power live the heaviest days since 1929. 
The couriers yet always knock metal teáskocsijaikat on the pavements, loaded trays with a muffin transported onto the morning discussions. 
Men with a Spanish lip shuffle aling between the block houses always yet, lugged as a human mule ötvenvalahány ironed shirt, that they hang down from a loop being similar to a yoke flung over their shoulder. 
The office employees queue for their morning sweet bakery product on the pavement always yet standing ételeskocsiknál, and yet to hold an impossible cab on weekday afternoon between 4 and 7 always. 
I did not feel that there would be an any kind of crisis situation while I did not decide that I open a new bank account despite all sinister news afternoon on a Thursday. 
I planned it in such a way deliberately though that I arrange the thing on the time of the afternoon calmness JP Morgan Chase in my bank's local branch, you are already however 20 men faced me in the row. 
Not at the teller's window, you are where it is possible to put on money to pay, but at the customer service's counter, the tourists ask direction where the older clients order a cheque-book Macy's towards a department store, and where the new clients open a bank account. 
Many people before me - I found it out later Starrtól, from the banker ordered to me - they queued up with the same intention, than I. 
It was taken out differently, already from me however their money from the smaller banks which can be hit on their residence, than for example New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
Money was withdrawn it some from called savings banks (that like that, than the home building cooperatives), from credit unions, and from the so provincial savings banks, which affect only one single state,, and their clients are treated as a family member supposedly. 
15 banks like this went silently onto a trunk in the past year. 
Washington Mutual, a bank at which 327 billion dollar capitals are found his, its way under an assignee in bankruptcy in the past days, and when the New York ones left home onto a weekend in the evening on a Friday, an other bank, Wachovia, bank ambulance looked for with 440 savings with a sum of a billion dollars buying out. 
The office and shop employees facing me, a newer one transmitted their money into a bank like that being afraid of collapse, that seemed a safe refuge, into the bank that makes most capital injection buyouts on Wall Street. 
The plain New York peoples the past one they turned into an expert in the financial affairs under some weeks. 
A woman bankrupt Lehman Brothers talked about a bank and his general manager with a huge appearance in that manner on his telephone in the local Chinese department store, Dick Fuldról, as if would complain about a lazy colleague. 
Lyn though, the uniformed, fifty assignee of the block of my flat being in his years changed a topic, now not Bradről and from Angelina, or we talked about my food freight, got used. 
Joined the discussion about me in this manner after I had been to the bank: I invested all of my saved money in money-market devices. 
Alternate, you did not play dice.

I do not prepare the photographs, drawn personal one on the stage I would like to introduce the artist laterally Günther Bauer Fotóművész 
There is not scenery, neither frills, neither dancing shoes. 
The grand masters of the flamenco from body contact, without the excitements of the appearance: that let us be allowed to recognize the dancers' everyday face. 
On the one part the artist. 
On the other hand the everyday man. 
And this there may not be two laterally to distinguish, withdrawn the intimate one, far from an audience in moments, we may grasp the depth of a caught look when we may learn by watching a personal move, or we may get surprised by the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist not preparing for his scenic appearance just. 
German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people title his photo series the singers, dancers and guitarists' theatricals the masters melds it with this less known everyday side of his. 
Through the photos the specific iconography of the flamenco from different visual angles presents it. 
The part of the exhibition, which is the flamenco for his Fényképészet Hónap,, the flamenco from day to day reflects his growing international significance - believes the creator, added to it, that the Flamenco-anybody could be the character of people, since it hits upon the observer upon seeing the pictures, that these pictures depict the artists on an atypical manner. 
These peoples got for a lentil end on a street artists who are capable passion, sadness, to take happiness onto the stage... and to take the audience prisoner. 
The scenic one taking a photo is suitable for the grasp of their personality at the same time. 
Their personality and their character their being legmélyén dwells. 
I would have liked to create intimate atmosphere that makes it possible in order for me to be allowed to immortalize the personality of the leaders of the flamenco with the help of the camera. 
Cante but las Minas a festival got it Bauer ran in 1997 by means of long one dynamically, for which the flamenco prepared portraits with a plate camera on his row from singers, guitarists and dancers. 
These portraits quote the classic photography duly for the camera and the choice of subject. 
The application of the different stylistics devices breaks with the traditional pictorial depiction however, and suggests modernity. The next thought reflects Bauer idea faithfully from the flamenco: This a traditional music at which roots are, which changes from day to day however, and always fascinating. 
Not the dance, not too you are the song merely the music, the artist's personality, his character charm the audience with a shock rather. 
In the days El Fotómata the leitmotif of creations which can be inspected in a gallery the search of meeting the substantive one, the artistic magic, that the perception, the existence and the representation turn into visible one through his manner. 
Between the known shapes of the flamenco, many people Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo names hallmark this photograph collection introducing sixty artists then. 
The project turned into a flamenco anthology in one, from which they are sufficient for an album covering the portraits presented on the exhibition soon. 
Bauer his passion for the portraits two the veteran urged it to repeating the idea eating sportsmen's portraits with a series (SportARTproject). 
Bar the Flamenco-the concept of people differs from this slightly, the photo artist adds it to it: I like to take a photo of peoples very much, to step to recognize and a longer one or shorter one onto a moment their life. 
My opinion the heaviest genre of the photography the portrait. 
With peoples like that, meet, with personalities like that brings together the fate, who you do not know sometimes, or who devote only a couple of minutes to taking a photo. 
But I try to realize my ideas always as a photographer despite these circumstances. 
Chose from the portraits of the contemporary flamenco, Flamenco-people exhibition wearing a title Alameda but Hérculesszel parallel calle but la Mata October which can be inspected in 20 El Fotómata Galéria who can be found under my mouth until 16.

May blood's, Garci epic creation 
Benito Pérez Galdós Nemzeti Epizód title his work inspired José Luis Garcit, who the Spanishs recalls the insurrection of famous franciaellenes in the May blood, that, with 15 million of the Euro budgets of a neighbourhood, the large-scale creation of his filmography. 
The director attempted to illustrate analysing the milling crowd admired by it always in the known novelist's work and social one according to this. Garci told all this to the populous audience consisting of the actors in Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría company on the film premiere today. 
The more than two and a half clockmaker May vér-t it is presented on a Friday in the cinemas, later Telemadrid projects it as a mini series in an extent being over four clocks then though. 
His big admirer accomplished the childhood dream of José Luis Garci, Galdós literature with this turning. Esperanza Aguirrének may say thank you for all this, he entrusted it with three years before from Madrid Tartomány, how the May should prepare a memory film 2 onto the 200. anniversary of Madrid events. Garci accepted the invitation with that condition, if the basis of the story Nemzeti Epizód they may get it. 
Madridi Autonóm Tartomány financed the 15 million budget in full whole one's, and Garci meant a special opportunity to him: may have presented the perplexed Spanishs with period scenery and fancy dress, who from a mistake they supported a bad leader, Since the fight continued for the independence embroiled the country in huge underdevelopment VII. with Ferdinánd reign - said it. 
The director expressed his regret, for which the May blood may not have accounted, after all more than duplájára with the budget of kicking Alatriste or Goya phantoms. Omitting some scenes from the script was obliged because of this, that - than with many other occasions - Horacio Valcárcellel together sign. 
So the director of the resumption resorted to his usual working method, recorded the scenes with the actors with who he started the tests before the turning already. Casting was not because Garci considers it one humiliating it, and because, than said it, the part of the director's trade going to the theatre and a cinema, that we find it out, what is going on in the industry in which we work. 
More of the actors of the May blood, for example on Miguel Rella, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo did not step first in front of his camera. 
Garci - who four are with an Oscar nomination, and may be flaunting an Oscar - some believes, that the this year's candidates representing Spain before Hollywoodi Akadémia, that is the May blood, the seven French billiard tables and the end selected from among blind sunflowers one do not represent the Spanish cinema's young generation, it would be necessary to present it although - said it. 
Garci does not count on prizes with this film of his. 
You believe it initially, you work for the posterity, you realize that the weal counts only then, finally you are glad already though, if a film of yours is ready yet - Garci says it then with 30 year vocational careers behind his back.

The artist of the free dance and the eastern dances were his experts. 
Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt fought for the female emancipation, even as a pioneer in the course of his busy life.

For example from the dance of the butterfly the guajira, you are the snake his dance the tango. 
Danced sensuously and this characterize my style according to others - tells it. 
Two extraordinary participating ones raise the light of the lecture: Miguel Poveda sings again on Isabel's lecture now after the open door; and Matilde wanted to work with an earlier pupil of Coral, who this is in a case exceptionally, together.

The piece who lives in London presents the woman's life in a big part, but is traveling all over Europe, and it gets onto landscapes counting as distant one yet in those days, between many people into India, United States or Italy. 
I would have liked to raise a memorial him because of that, it is not known already nowadays at the same time because his personality had a big effect on his own age and his working class is valued less yet - says it Bayón.

Without Paul Newman not too attractive America like that 
God sometimes perfect peoples stature. 
Paul Newman was like this. 
The quotation Sally Field comes from an actress who, the victims of the sensation title Newmannel worked in a film, and that stunning and helplessness reflects it, that Newman death in the American cinema trade, and in all America caused. 
How difficultly he got to Oscar though. 
Withdrew in 2007, 
and was ill generally known, 
but his death upset everybody even in this manner. 
Sometimes absurdity to put our feelings into words, and I lost a good friend now - Robert Redford said it between tears, - his existence made my life and this country right. 
Nobody was afraid that he becomes ridiculous possibly or goes over the top. 
One of the cinema's and the homeland's heroes went away in an especially dark period, that the terrorism and the desperate search of the fear because of the market relations, the American self-esteem and the dignity shaded. 
When so heavy times change and many people lose their virtues and most little easily a man like that is left over, onto who up we can look up, Luis Cernudának is not needed then to be it, that Paul Newmant we admire it. 
The Platonic beauty and a truth ideal personified it practically in the peoples' eye. 
Richard Nixon formal enemy and lost and won cases shielding was, from an anti-drug foundation established for his departed first-born son's memory started in the drug overdose the one with a home-made character bioélelmiszer-márkájának his formation. 
A gift was real to exceed the suicidal nutritional culture of a country that was top notch difficultly. 
My overwhelming admiration carcass wandered over whole Hollywood onto nationalities and ancestry truth without a look. 
According to last James Bond, English Daniel Craig not a man, but an era died with him. 
An other English, Oscar-díjas Sam Mendes made a statement in such a way that Newmannel completed common work meant the apex of his career unambiguously. 
Russell Crowe, a badass arrived from Australia Newmant directly largest inspiring entered sporting event. 
Put the plank onto very tall one mindannyiunk for him - George Clooney established it, who possibly it few people one, who attempt to observe Paul Newman lifestyle today: the honesty and the serious one is requested and far from cameras privacy. 
This is not easy always if the today's one is possible altogether amidst a media jungle. 
Is after all, who tests it,, and Paul Newman his ideal. 
Once in a divorced but loyal marriage lived until fifty years then Joanne Woodwarddal, everything would have been his number occasion certainly though onto the infidelity. 
Why I shall eat hamburger somewhere else if the roast meat is waiting at home? - was joking. 
May be proud of him in the heaven, that on the land his daughters in one fan, what is not too frequent because of that in America. 
All of his shaping was not so much proud of one, than the loyal husband, onto the role of the loving father, the caring granddad and the devoted philanthropist - it is told. 
The rough road of the Madrid Olympic Games 
Really many of his dreams a Madrid Olympic Game, and may be after the 2012 one did not succeed, that there will be 2016 from him. 
But, I ask it, really up we are being ready for him? 
Because if we set out from the yesterday's running race, according to me altogether not. 
It was called a perfect competition, but this was the worst one according to my sight the from among a lot, on which I was once,. 
Senselessnesses tömkelege characterize it, and if it would be necessary to value it once, and I would be the examiner, diving unambiguously would be the results. 
Na but let us take one point at a time and we start it on his front. 
The senselessnesses began with the receipt of the number since it was necessary to arrive early because of this. 
This merely yet not problem, but if the man is going soon already, let him obtain everything at least simultaneously (including the chip, the later queuing to be avoided). 
Back this did not happen. 
The number was conveyed exclusively first (first senselessness, to go there soon because of this only) and (after the usual queuing), what kind of surprising one, only S-es there was a shirt (second senselessness, with what for me dot XL-es my size)! 
In a what kind of world do we live? 
You are because of the crisis in that manner they decided, they save on the substance and cheaper, small-sized shirts are bought only? 
But all the same, these things look small on the day of the running race compared to bygones always yet. 
Apart from the fact that it was necessary to go there to take over the chip on his terrible age, the queuing lasted counted from the arrival until 15 minutes, and it was necessary to hand in even the bagpack. 
The waiting was at 35 minutes long, which is incomprehensible, an more than with 11.000 men counter in the case of a running race. 
So, the competition began as he was expected, and we did not hand in the bagpack yet. When succeeded finally, it was even worse. 
That of the falling even pleasanter one made it apart from this the more than 40 minute waitings, which popular uprising and pitch attack experiments interspersed,. 
According to me onto tomorrow some 500 people we catch safe pneumonia, and some people, including myself, we do not get our place with our actual time. I presuppose that my chip fixed the departure wrongly. 
This would not occur to me accidentally naturally if they would ask me about the perfect running race. 
So that we may continue the reverie according to me an well from a baldy Olimpic city. 
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for a receptionist 
MI Microsoft presented the development of a new picture recogniser and a human interactional system on his Feltörekvő Technológia conference, uniform - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which is capable of the accomplishment of some fundamental tasks however,. Knows a cab for example (you are in Microsoft's case a vehicle being in service on the company's area) to call in was heard from the talk based on informations. 
This receptionist a camera and a form and face recogniser are able to recognize it with the help of a system, how many people there are in the room how, who they - indeed, notices it, that, what kind of dresses are worn -, furthermore hears and understands the keywords of their talks. 
He can group the person present based on the talks apart from this. 
The show on a video the receptionist a lady identifies a third party, but knows it, that does not belong to the company talking with him and not too the firm's employee. 
Asks it, came into a visitor to somebody and insures it afelől, that hurries to his assistance soon. 
All this is the blue one without a big screen. 
Impressive. 
But this naturally his coming music. 
The company has a more important thing currently, for example Windows carrying out product development for the new version of an operating system. 
Many people were whispering that Microsoft changes a strategy on the week. 
Windows will be 7 smaller ones and less imply an additional program. 
Steve Ballmer realized it, that if the necessary programs would run only instead of the much commercial garbage on the computers, the machines would be five times faster then - bravo, Steve, this already something. 
The sealing wax was invented, considering, that Microsoft attached plus functions and extras to Windows in all new versions till now. 
The reversal is repaid. 
Microsoft has truth, the operating system is sidelined rather continually, and himself the software. 
I joined the theory when Google Chrome appeared on the net, that Google took the first step with this it, that Windows rival let him be. 
Many people realized that a browser is not the part of the operating system correctly. 
Onto the operating system there will be need always, since indispensable element to the dialogue of the hardware and the software. 
Plays the same role, than your wife you are his husband when you want to say something to his mother-in-law. 
That is right. 
Will never disappear, but it is necessary to reckon with the death of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense. 
Ballmer this week's statement supports this thought. 
The peoples pay increasingly less attention to the operating system, and increasingly more onto the web browser. 
We switch the computer on because of that only, that let us open Firefox or the Explorer up - or the Chrome-ot - and increasingly more time devoted to the browsing, which we spend in the world of the windows,. 
Onto what truth the big part of applications going hand in hand with the system then? 
The less sometimes more. 
And Windows less, much less have to be 7 at Vista. 
Less difficult, less burdened, less complicated. 
Microsoft's aim, that rather on-line integrates his services, and that let him report an alternative opposite Google finally. 
Onto all this rather they have need, I say an example immediately, that why. 
I took this photo in a lounge worked up for Microsoft employees in Redmond on the front of the month. 
A placard calls upon them for it on the soft drink automaton up, the firm's browser is used. - Your browser. Our future. 
An independent examination established it in 2006, that the Microsoft employees 66%-a used Google for Internet browsing. 
Him being late was announced to Windows Mobile 7 new versions on the last week anyway. 
Not 2009 of his fronts, but arrives on his end, indeed, rather in 2010. 
Microsoft presumably Windows 7 and Windows Mobile try out putting 7 bands on the market then. 
The mobile phone serves as a computer rather continually after all. 
But the slipping, considering, that the android and the iPhone are on a market already, will spoil their business anyway. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso carried this Costa Azulon, Leonardo di in Caprio Edward Zwick bloody diamond, Al Pacino though Francis Ford Coppola Keresztapájában, furthermore this the kneaded gay one of customers' basis clothings. 
And we may recall the peacetime figure of the traveling circus's weightlifter with a rakish mustache even if we are at the enumeration of the specialities already. 
But what we talk about? Not from something else, than the - characteristically narrow and sleeveless - man from a cotton vest. 
That is the "tank-ról, as it is angolajkúak enter sporting event, but the down Fabuleux Marcel but Bruxelles-finds none of his rivals may rise to a competition. 
First his elegant name - bar between friends only Marcel sulphur they keep recalling it -, for what he may say thank you to the sport, according to the legend since Marcel is Cerdan from a boxer, Edith Piaf from a singer's lover the name of a last. 
Marcel the cut of his distinguished cotton substance, unisex, his specific emblem and the little one (hardly recognisable) is manifest because of a Belgian flag his competitors. This latter one the most characteristic models carry it hidden into the neck part of the shirt. 
Though the Belgian firm not a tank prepares tops only. 
The sport tops, retro boxerek, cashmere cardigans, wool trousers, sailor shirts, baby clothes, mini shorts - and we could enumerate it yet - all-all between the firm's products owe. 
And all of them belong to the category of the comfortable undergarment, 
bar unfortunate in one, that it is necessary to carry them as undergarment. 
It too good. 
I would like to be a young mommy; all the same, who will be the father 
Resembles his sibling very much, he managed to accomplish himself at the same time. 
Monica Cruz small and fragile, but he has a winter with energy. 
The Cruz sisters would like to undertake a more serious role in the fashion's world currently. 
The model means much more to Monica at it since some pretty and beautiful girls add his name to something. 
Mango was present on the promotion of a firm's new Parisian seat, and on the passing of the of rank fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company. 
Impressive warmth and tameness stream from him. 
What do you do in Paris actually? 
We present Mango new autumn-winter collection, that my sibling, Penélopével planned. We take a part in the opera on his annunciation and the gala dinner arranged onto Valentino respect apart from this. 
A thick day, the true one burn, but very exciting. 
This fourth season of yours is Mango at a firm. From where you drew the inspiration to the new collection? 
Both of them we adore the cinema of the 50 and 60 years; from there very much we took everything over. 
Next, I roam the city and attention only many times the women, how they get dressed, how they ring changes on it and they make a selection of their dresses - one of these one favourite pastimes of mine. 
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer. You are a multi-faceted woman, true? 
I believe this, but these three things are related finally, since very much in them the common dot. 
The dresses are interested in small soot already, I was waiting hardly in order to be allowed to go to my grandma, and let me be allowed to rummage in my big auntie's wardrobes. 
Na, it himself was Kánaán, with a funfair reached almost. 
I tried to pay attention to my dressing always as a dancer next. 
You know it, we dancers we like to guess our own style onto the clocks and the tests that we should feel well if we look into the mirror. 
You really identify with your role when you get the fancy dress though in the actress role. 
You see it, everything is linked to everything, and all of my respect the designers' and that of their expertise. 
You celebrated your 30. birthday recently. Did you not fall into lethargy? 
Á, by any means! 
Myself feel it better, than once, I like the 30 years. 
The women really ripen by this time according to me, burns already experienced and fewer mistakes are committed in the life. 
The biological clock though does not worry. 
I make for what I have desire since my childhood, and this with big inner happiness fills. 
And you would like to be a mother or not? 
Naturally, I know it that I will be a mother because I was born for this as a woman, indeed, I would like to be a young mommy, I want to omit this in no way. 
What the prospective father deserves though, all the same, who it will be. 
I would like to bring up my child in happiness and big-big affection. 
Drop some words from the cinema. You shot more films last year, what were not presented yet. 
Really, and I am waiting for them being calculated hardly already. 
I, who I started in a theatre, very impatient and I am restless, I want everything promptly, but I know that this is impossible of course. 
I am waiting for the last clock and the search of Christ's grave being presented hardly. 
I am curious, what you say to them... 
If I know it well, a couple of his days you debuted on the caddy Naomi Campbellel. 
Na, not, this because of that in this manner not true... 
I did not go up as a model onto the caddy. 
I know Naomi Campbell for a long time, and onto a charity fashion show called simply into London, that the own one, women for a better world name directed in favour of his organization. I selected two own Mango collections. The presented dresses were auctioned off, the flowed in sum though Naomi NGO-jának it was offered. 
The peoples do not know it, what kind of good-hearted Naomi. 
So much everything is collected from him, back I know it, and I may assure you of him, that his half true. 
I take his good side for his activity always on the other hand. 
For a noble case invited onto the fashion show, but I do it if he would have wanted me to depend on a head. 
I do not know impossibility if the stake is the fate of the women living in the third world. 
The relapsing intoxicated leaders will be obliged Alcolock installing 
The Ministry for Home Affairs after three minor offences because of drunk driving a construction like that installing would oblige the motorist, that would prevent the starting of the vehicle if the driver is in an intoxicated state or does not blow into the construction. 
The proposal was submitted in a June, and Államügyészi Hivatal deals with him, according to which the experimental project lasts until a year then, already currently. 
With what the aim of a project into the traffic truth restoration, the motorist has to attend a traffic repeating course being about upbringing then. 
Közlekedési Főigazgatóság takes a part in the experiment apart from Közlekedésbiztonsági Főügyészség (DGT) and car safety Technológiai Intézet Alapítvány (FITSA) too. 
The motorists arrested repeatedly because of the drunk driving according to the statistics 30-75%-a sits into a car again. 
Alcolock would prevent this since the system being in a connection with the vehicle establishes the alcohol level of the air blown into it. You are if it is bigger at the allowed one the system does not allow it to start the car if the driver did not blow into the apparatus altogether. 
The more than the expense of 1000 Euro instruments the violator would burden. 
A 2007 study made in USA concerning this proved it, that the vehicles equipped with the instruments like this the installing in first year even 65%-kal too the number of the minor offences may be reduced. 
This rule could save the life of 115 men annually according to the estimates though in Spain. 
The measure from two reasons concentrates on the minor offences: on the one hand in this manner easier to prevent from them degenerating into a crime, 
on the other hand plainer to introduce since the execution of the legal reform is going on in the usual bed while the necessary one is criminal case to a reform onto a fundamental law modification there would be need. 
The instrument is available in an any kind of commercial form although it was installed already into some industrial and civil service vehicles in an experimental mode of operation yet on the Spanish market. 
The chamber of deputies votes on that initiation of Spanyol Szocialista Munkáspárt tomorrow, that - onto a French sample - the system promotes installing him into school buses. 
In Mexico, a closed shoe 
With English accuracy, in the time announced in the program, 17 clocks Mexikóvárosi Benito Juárez landed on an airport's presidential hangar at the time of 40 minutes the Spanish airforce Asturiasi Hercegi Párt his machine carrying a load. 
The day was in one going down already, but royal party getting out from the airplane pinned onto so much yet that we may have seen it using our hand as blinkers only. 
The Spanish ambassador and other of rank personalities stood at the foot of the stair. 
I asked a cab driver before it on the street with a couple of clocks, knows about him, that Spanish duke Pár comes to an official visit into the city. 
- Na splendid, today will not be airport transfer until good time then... the woman local you are something like this... 
- Not, not my lord, the lady Spanish, until some years lived here just only. 
-Ja, you are in that manner... 
But the Mexican press, it knows everything about Asturiasi Hercegi Pár and the significance of their visit next. 
Many people, who supply the protection of the dignities, wait at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon formed by the 27 sailor soldiers. 
The prince appears, smiling, in sea-blue dresses, then the princess, his long hair gets the wind, in moderate clothes, but not the usual one, toes flashing in a shoe - it was warned possibly, that a storm threatens Mexikóváros. 
They stop for a moment and they smile for the cameras, they enter the hall where the official reception follows then. 
In their hotel's gate - that the city for four largest hotels' one - one of the Mexican television's garrulous newswomen wait for them. 
The most valuable fashion prize 
The world is most suitable for the passing of a fashion prize his place undoubtedly Paris, and from among the fashion designers living today the most subtle one and the coolest one undoubtedly Valentino. 
Mango invited applications for it recently El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards second application, the aim of which for the young talents of the fashion trade international acquainting. 
300.000 euros are the main awards. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first application the Parisian boulevard Haussmann saw again his dresses with own planning in the shop-window of Mango under 54, and shed a tear because of the touchedness almost. 
Incidentally this the firm's second largest European business and opened recently on 1335 square metres. 
The largest business in London can be found. 
The very many events, and Valentinonak ploughs - for the jury's presidency roaming - we hit ourselves on a luxury dinner finally amidst acknowledgements the Parisian in Garnier Opera. 
The presidential table of the gala dinner prepared by Mango looked even more spectacularly in most enjoyable Chagalok company. 
Nati, who is his sibling recently, ensued came with a heavy heart and sadly because of his death, one of the firm's pieces and ELAH bore some breathtaking ornaments of his. Nearly two metres tall Luis name Valentinot accompanied it hand in hand with his son to the head table of the dinner arranged onto his respect. 
Andi, Mango proprietor and his host amused the guests. Rotchil they were so gallant to a baron in a university that they were left without a suit since both of them presented a lady with it finally.

On the night opera visit into Gaya Toledo company became enthusiastic in that manner the balett-teremben, that fluttered to one of the poles recalling the old times and a grand plie-féleséget impromptu. 
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but showed some photos before it on his mobile phone his son.

Brought his own bedsheets and his towels, and good ahead told that he asks any kind of scenting into the room. 
Stars under Paris's starry sky. 
Oh là là, c'est la vie. 
1001, the stress relieving number 
Not 1000, but there are 1000 and a manner in that direction, that turn off from the chaotic and muddled weekdays. 
Additional good news, that we may find all of them in one single book, which is a September, arrives on 30 into the bookshops in order to bring the calmness. 
Quasi torturer the clock rattle in the morning at the time of 7, but even worse to reflect on it, onto a what kind of accelerated life forces day after day the today's world. 
The office's name tenseness, the computer's though backache. 
The stress the XXI. a century's endemic. 
But for overcoming the daily exhaustion and the bridging of the workplace problems not an and not too he has two manners. 
Not, this mouth of mine is equal to exactly 1001 entirely. 
You are the spa on the yoga positions, the classic massage beyond treatments Susannah Marriott offers the wide scale of opportunities in his book, that let everybody be allowed to find it the mostly his mood truth and solution which can be tailored to his free moments. 
The stress relieving work the 1001 relaxation methods title carries it and the calmness streaming from him Pearson Alhambra y DK arrives from a publisher into the bookshops. 
If you is from him keeping up with, that from the world of the workplace or the personal contacts hardly avoidable who the stress, this handbook makes it unstable then in his faith certainly on all of them. 
Indeed, offers other ideas, which all of them are, in addition to this-all of them help in the relaxation, for example hints in that direction, how we shall find our way near to the nature or how prepare 100%-ig natural foods. 
If the body of his adrenalin level is too low already his refreshing and the life of the stress turned into his central problem, here his time to lean back in the armchair, to relax and to concentrate on the reading only. 
Who speak in their dream 
Some children speak night. 
I do not give a thought to those who start up and it is told totally awake, what happened to them same day, but those who speak during sleep. 
The phenomenon may appear frightening possibly at the first try, but effectively totally harmless. 
This well-meaning sleep disorder somniloquismusnak it is called. 
Quite frequent, mainly among the children and adolescents. 
They were told that a night spoke already sure. 
May be totally rhapsodical regarding his frequency (occurs at an illness entailing a tall fever only one times for example), you are more regular (you are daily, weekly monthly once), and the child remembers nothing following day generally. 
His appearance onto one single efficient cause which cannot be leaded back. 
Often with other sleep disorders, for example with nightmares, night with starting up, night nocturnal enuresis (enuresis nocturna) you are with somnambulism is accompanied, but this legal. 
State entailing a tall fever as we mentioned it already, you are the concomitant phenomenon of a stress situation or a tense excitement state even may be. 
It was studied slightly this far whatever. 
The intensity of the speech is very changing likewise. 
May be quiet, calm, may consist of incoherent words, murmur, but it may occur to all these in a contrast, that shouting, crying or a length speech come forward in his form. 
In as much the phenomenon very intensive, advisable to track the child and to turn to a specialist. The examination may reveal it, a problem inducing some kind of big anxiety does not consist in the background and may offer a solution hereby. 
Than we mentioned it already, from a well-meaning phenomenon there is a word, succession is not onto him therapy, unless does not go hand in hand with one of the other, forms of the sleep disorder which can be handled (you are with insomnia with a stress situation for example). 
We may make some things after all on the other hand, íme a bunch of preventive measure: 
Let us pay attention to the child being calm before lying down let him be left over. 
Let us select comforting games and we avoid that the child should look at frightening or more aggressive TV programs or series. 
We teach the nervousness to some relaxation methods in order for the inner calmness to be found much more easily for inclined or children relaxing more difficultly. 
This procures the calmer sleep for the child. 
We try to stay calm if sleep starts speaking meanwhile after all. 
Let us not forget it, for this child harmless, and they will remember nothing following day. 
Useful councils 
Let the child not be wake up. 
Would be unnecessary because the child is not his consciousness, would be put off the sleep on the other hand. 
Sleeps long effectively in spite of the fact that he speaks and rests. 
Let it not be forgotten, if strong anxiety accompanies the phenomenon, advisable one to a specialist many times turning is you to reveal, what induces the intense anxiety in the child. 
If he speaks understandably (this rarer case), let it not start being asked questions in order for them to be found out about anything. 
Would be unnecessary anyway, since during sleep not so conscious, that let him gather up his thoughts. 
On the other hand, you hear the speech only, but the dreams joining him are not seen, let them be cautious because of this the they heard with his interpretation and the potential inferences. 
Let the child be never told that it can be questioned about his secrets at night. 
Even from a joke. 
This induces very big anxiety. 
So that most important one, how they should not be worried, since from only some minute harmless episodes there is a word. 
Finally in a straight Illhaeusern 
Illhaeusern team bought new impetus finally after long contour flying, and obtained a victory again on a domestic orbit. 
The yellow-black ones got into a situation many times although a match was not stormy, from which they were able to win taking advantage of one finally. 
The pace of the match was not too tight since the aggressors sensed the suitable rhythm difficultly. 
The visiting team's captain, Kauffmann tried shooting onto the first gate, the distant ball just affected the upper pole of the goalpost only however. Illhaeusern got into superiority then, and the shootings followed each other: Fonderflick tried out a distant shooting, then Hirn shooting above the gate flied. Romain with tipsiness, Diebold tried to make Dannemarie protection unstable with a distant experiment likewise though. 
The players defended themselves grouping himself into a block on the midfield on the other side, and only it örökmozgó Riahi got into a shot position. 
The beginning of the second half-time promised to be deciding of importance one: Riahi and Temporale got into a situation on Dannemarie side first. The first goal came into existence then immediately: ball bouncing out after Diebold first shooting the illhaeuserni Marais got it with an excellent positioning, brought it into the gate then (53. minute). 
Illhausern goal scorer may not have enjoyed the glory however for a long time: losing the orbit was later obliged one with twelve minutes, his teammates had to continue the fight in one man down in this manner. 
Dannemarie was not able to push his advantage on the other hand: the home team was not caused many problems, who just only a small one they lasted long backwards, that let their protection be increased. The last seconds held some excitement back when the ball got most near to the goalpost following big hot haste alone. 
Sarkozy meets the furious fishers 
Nicolas Sarkozy puts a bypass into Bretagne before he would be flying into United States. 
A demonstration kept by the fishers on a Monday disabled the traffic of more Bretons and Norman harbour. The president of the republic made the decision in that manner because of this, makes visiting in the morning on a Tuesday the Finistère-beli in Le Guilvinec harbour, how he should meet the demonstrators' representatives. 
Latter they promised for the president to be received in a constructive ghost, and it was expressed it their hope, that Sarkozy arrives with actual proposals.

On David Martin, the president will negotiate with the fishers about it according to the president's of the republic spokesman, with what kind of solutions the companies would be allowed to help with the repossession of their competitiveness, to make the working conditions and the waging safer for the sailors concerned. 
The fishers wait for Nicolas Sarkozy arrival resolvedly. 
Tuesday Morbihan and Calvados kept traffic slowing demonstrations, with which 10 are neighbourhoods, in a county in the morning km long congestions were brought about. 
The traffic of Quiberon yacht port was disabled, but the Belle-roads driving towards île it was not locked away.

The sailors gave evidence of their desperation already on a Monday. Tyres and pallets were set on fire at dusk then the bresti harbours üzemanyagraktárai, while demonstrations were going on Concerneau-ban and Saint-Brieucben too. 
Additional stirs followed this the Atlanti coast and La in Manche other harbours. Vendée county Sables d'Olonne-ban the fishers did not board a ship for example, while some twenty ships obstructed the traffic of the merchant ships in Le Havre. 
The Loire-in Atlantique county can be found La Turballe and Le Croisic fishers brought it to an end in the evening the Donges-ban working huge Total an oil refinery's blockade. 
Boulogne-sur-dares his fishers decided that the Wednesday seat to be held in the ministry is waited for with deciding about the additional steps on the other hand. 
Le Guilvinecben has to decide about his next step and his participation on a Tuesday on the Parisian agricultural and piscatorial meeting planned in a ministry. 
Some Bretons a fisher would not like the national piscatorial commission's leaders representing his interests since the commission did not favour their endeavours however. 
The strike continues long, because the fishers do not take off their claims and they are not willing to travel into Paris - Liliane Cariou announced it for example, the Lorient-i a piscatorial commission's president. 
The professional fishers, who do not pay a tax after the gas oil, pay approximately 50 cents for his litre currently, they reckon that the function of a ship would turn into profitable one in that manner only however, if the gas oil is his price litre 0,30 euros would fall below it.

The plan the republicans nearly two three voted it down. 
The market extracted bad signs from this, since it seems that the congress is unable to approve a plan - believes Lindsey Piegza, it FTN Financial his analyst. 
Is apparent from this, how much the market counted on this plan - added it to it, expressed his related concern with it then, that if some are daytimes a plan like this would be accepted later, it would be too late already. 
If the plan is sentenced to a death really (...), then the covers-en (American central bank - the szerk.) and the row will be on the rest of the central banks in order for the crisis to be handled, and the credit conditions will get stricter long - Brian Bethune, Global Insight driving economist warn.

Obama gained the first television duel 
A newer one, which had to decide it, observed the Friday, first debate of the two American presidential candidates, that John McCain or Barack Obama get out of the duel as a winner. 
Not surprising on a manner, the republican and the democrat the responsible of a campaign said the victory to their own in that television duel equally, that the American households one third with accompanied attention. 
David Gergen according to a political analyst did not prove to be rather fascinating after all although John McCain appearance was venerable it, that let him stop the decrease of his popularity: this is proven before the presidential election with five weeks prepared surveys. 
Gallup according to an institute the democrat a candidate is doing better in the fight: Obama is in a five-point benefit according to the results of the poll published on a Saturday McCainnel in an eye (44% concerned 49%). 
The mostly calculating, yet among indecisive electors the asked 39%-a Obama will win, while 25%-uk McCain counts on his victory an, prepared by way of CBS according to a survey. 
Obama increases his benefit by his fellow party's, Joseph Biden Thursday performance promising to be superb one long expectedly. Biden the first and one single public one prepare for his debate with his rival, Sarah Palinnel. 
Bill Clinton warned in this manner on the weekend however: There would be a mistake Palin to respect. 
He has good intuitions. 
Seventy McCain being years old never fails it into a forefront to put own, indisputably his enormous foreign affairs experience. His adversary emphasizes his naivety beside all this in these questions, which consisted in the centre of their first personal meeting,. 
Is disappearing in that manner, Obama a senator does not understand it, that... - the attack was over with more occasions. 
I do not believe in the fact that Obama is a senator takes action it is necessary to a presidential position with an experience and knowledge - McCain declared it. 
This capital attack surface, of which they take advantage, the yesterday running Republican TV advertisings. 
Obama laid the emphasis that he represents the future on it on the other hand. 
Did not allow it to embarrass himself: on one gathered up and composed punctually. 
Stressed that he is able to bring good decisions and to restore the picture formed about United States in the world. 
McCain does not take it always yet, Obama on the other hand already yes - retorted on the weekend a democrat radiated advertising, that the republican reproaches a leader with it, that it did not assess the American effect of the crisis has on a street's folk always yet. 
John McCainnek was the message of a forest under ninety of the minutes of the debate from me, but nothing - Obama declared it yesterday before twenty thousand men, who gathered in rain pouring in north Carolina onto the electoral meeting. 
The middle class or the employees did not drop it only on his mouth yet words. A chaotic situation took shape undoubtedly in the financial world Obamának favours, who the Americans the they are heading for suitable one in that direction mostly, that let him save the economy being at a standstill on the edge of collapse. 
The coming week may prove to be a turning point - believed yesterday Charles Schumer, the influential democrat senator. 
Rahm Emanuel democrat so distinguished instincts are at Obama disposal on the area of the economy according to one of a representative's, the Clinton government's veterans, than Bill Clinton on the time of the 1998 monetary crisis. 
The democrat in a presidential candidate's eye the current crisis the final judgement above the bad economic policy being through the eight years, that George Bush created McCain with a senator's support. 
The Illinois senator confirmed that it will be able to reduce it despite the stock exchange fluctuations again Americans 95%-ának his tax burdens. Added to it that his creation is included in the primary aims of the country's potential energetics independence by way of the application of the renewable energy sources, and the forming of a health insurance system. 
McCain plans the foundation of 45 atomic plants until 2030 on the other hand. 
Both presidential candidates avoided those questions carefully however, that the 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) sum bank ambulance they concerned a plan: the congress accepted the exceptionally unpopular plan in the evening yesterday. 
Minsk: Did you notice that making a choice here was going on? 
Young persons and oppositionist ones demonstrated on Sunday in the evening on the White Russian capital's main square in order for the expected result of the general election to be rejected. 
More hundred White Russians gathered on the main square of Minsk in order for them to protest against falsifying the electoral results following the closing of the polls in the evening on Sunday. 
Although results were not made an alley, several young persons yet Alexandr Lukasenko made a protest with the next words against a president: Dictator lord, let him resign!. 
Some people admit that you do not go away only yet szavazni:"Minek I would have been going? Anyway it make my vote, which is wanted,! - a young person says it. 
The demonstrators do not believe it, that the regime, that tried to indicate himself with European Union in a good colour before the foreign country observers truth from the aim of relationship buliding, would be inclined to a democratic political transformation. 
The country could be resolved if the observers would judge the choices to be clear afflicting sanctions, that 40 White Russian leaders were denied the visa in his framework, and some bank accounts were frozen. 
The choices were not going on purely however according to the opposition. 
We were kept at a distance from the election committees, and our observers may not have attended the poll - been sorry Jurij Potyemkin, from the twelve parties got organized, in this manner most heterogeneous Egyesült Demokratikus Erő a coalition's spokesman. 
The changes were nominal merely - Alekszandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election and the Pro European emphasize it a movement's leader. The essence it, who counts the votes how, and our case this executive power. 
It means that it was appointed if the opposition's envoys get into the parliament, not they were elected though. 
But them getting into the parliament makes it possible in order for place to be received in the television, let them be allowed to hold a meeting in the country's regions and let bills be allowed to be introduced. 
For the opposition so has to enter the scene in the political life because it is necessary to initiate the dialogue with European Union. 
Since, if our seriously indebted economy gets into a crisis opposite Russia and we are not able to be renewed, we risk it with this, that we find our way under Russia's authority. 
We would like to be independent on the other hand. 
The opposition is afraid that the European safety one following the process of the choice with close attention and Együttműködési Szervezet accept the result of the vote as valid one. 
It is stressed that the participative proportion appears too tall, and the organizing of the preliminary vote with a wide circle (on which in Minsk the constituents 26%-a bought part) provided an opportunity for an any kind of manipulation. 
You noticed that making a choice here was going on? - Alekszandr Kozulin asks the question social democrat leader, who this year in August you take off the prison as last one freely where it was detained as a political prisoner with himself. 
Nobody stayed in the polls. 
At most five oppositionist representatives will get into the parliament though, namely those who are equal to the leadership mostly. 
The silence of the night falls again onto Október térre. 
In the television though Lukasenko a president's and the central election committee's members rejoice they succeed. 
Again safe the blood 
It Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his foundation yesterday. Dr. Francine Décary a woman's good reason was a president onto the celebration, it dared Héma-Québec the world turned into the company of one of the safest and most efficient blood donors by today. 
What is the most important one though: managed to recover the peoples' confidence, that the 1980 one and 1990 years came to doubt with infected blood due to his related scandal seriously. 
Than known, the Canadian Red Cross national blood reserve treated by blood's service the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and the hepatitis C became infected with viruses in the 1980 years. 
Following the drama and the general outcry Canada Horace Krever initiated an official investigation with a judge's leadership in his government's 1994 Februaries. It was the aim of this in order for light to be clarified in that direction, what kind of circumstances leaded to the tragedy, and let the future similar cases formulate proposals his avoidance. 
While Krever is a judge was late with the submission of his meaning, some provinces created an own commission, for which the planning of a new blood treatment system was his aim for Canada. 
In Québec Gélineau a commission fulfilled this task. 
The Gélineau- and after Krever meanings two bloods a service came into existence in Canada:one Québec waiter Héma-Québec, the other one though all the other provinces and the two territories are responsible for supply Kanadai Vérellátó Társaság. 
When it Héma-Québec started his activity in 1998, for the peoples already hardly 38%-a Québec was blood with confidence for his system - remember Décary woman doctor. 
The situation was desperate. 
We managed to recover the peoples' confidence as the result of his correction and our work made on the area for the safety of the blood products on the other hand in the subsequent years. Décary declares that 2008 are the ones of Québec on a population's front already near proudly 94%-a it considered it one which can be entrusted Héma-Québecet. 
Décary a woman doctor does not forget that the confidence is an exceptionally fragile thing however. 
It Héma-Québec the carefulness applies his principle since founding 1998 Septembers on 28. 
Several cases like that were revealed in this period in Europe, when the mad cow disease, that is the Creutzfeldt-Jakob the new variant of an illness infected peoples - the woman doctor tells it, who directs the company since his 1998 foundation. 
We did not have an idea of him, that this illness expands on the road of blood. 
Because of this the Krever- and we leant on one of the most important recommendations of Gélineau meanings. Accordingly, if we are uncertain about a dog, and the risk of the development of a serious illness exists, we have to apply exclusive measures then. In a present case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob from an illness was a word, which causes the change of the brain, leads to a death inevitably in this manner. 
We did not accept blood from persons like that in 1999 of his Aprils because of this, who since 1980 more than a month was spent in United Kingdom. 
Some it was established eating though beyond any doubt that the illness expands on the road of blood. 
This case convinced us that he made sense to apply the principle of the carefulness. 
A technique, which the HIV virus is with a lot, appeared in 1999 on the market more sensitive makes diagnosing him possible. This nucleic acid test (NAT), that is able to manifest the virus himself directly in the blood donors' blood, not antibodies forming against the virus though, on which the previously-used tests were founded,. 
NAT we may have shortened the window period, which lasts from becoming infected to it, with the help of a test, while we can manifest the virus in the blood with the help of our technical devices - the specialist explains it. 
This period a week it was able to be reduced to a shorter time span. 
The risk of the fact that the blood donors should infect the blood substance apart from their knowledge was moderated significantly in this manner, and, that let it not be possible to manifest this. 
The risk of the aids expanding on the road of blood transfusion was reduced on a large scale with these developments. 
Our days the risk of the fact that somebody infected with a HIV virus gets blood, 12 million it to one. 
This means that we should hand out 12 million blood products while somebody becomes infected with the HIV virus composing some other way. 
With what it Héma-Québec 400-500 thousand hand out a blood product in all years, more than 24 years should pass it, that let a case like this take place, and let somebody become infected with a HIV virus through a blood product. 
I think that anybody is today already calmly may accept, or may write down vértranszfúziót in the interest of the restoration of the health - it claims it Héma-Québec his first No. leader. 
It to be come due course it will be the challenge of a decade in order for us to maintain the reliability of our products. 
We may never know it, a what kind of new pathogen gets into the system. 
Since the past happened in a year only, that the chikungunya appeared on Réunion szigetén-vírus, that gets into the blood with an insect-bite similarly to the West Nile virus. 
We have to be on a gap steadily because of this - Décary continued woman doctor, emphasized it then, that apart from the contingency funds it Héma-Québecnek has to ensure enough constant reserves. 
The claims increase by the population's ageing. 
The patients need the replacement of red blood cells or platelets often since the anti-cancer treatments turned into more aggressive ones. 
The population's ageing has an effect on the blood donors' substance, since the one in the network, persons' number is suitable for blood giving the population of Québec merely 3%-át amounts to it. 
Everything healthy, at least 18 year, persons fulfilling the suitability conditions may give blood on all of them in 56 days however, that is exerts an influence by an occasion annually. 
The candidates averagely 14%-ától blood is not accepted, dared for example AIDS-takes a slice you are with malaria infected. They though, who had been to a country like that, they were not eligible for blood giving until a year where malaria ravages. 
We have so many reserves with these 3 percentages that we can fulfill the hospitals' claims. 
Very rare, that we run out of the supplies. 
We have to increase the blood donors' number in a measure how the existing ones grow old because they may not give blood already after a time on the other hand. 
Though the peoples very heavy to convince, how blood should be given, but even heavier to keep them and to put on, that let them turn into regular blood donors. 
The man has one single clock hardly in this today's rushing world onto him, that let him go away to give blood - is sorry Francine Décary. 
From the 297 million dollar year budgets smallholder Héma-Québec not merely blood products, but insures human fabrics, for example the fabrics of bone transplants, cardiac valves, eyeballs and epidermis, that burned in persons' case seriously exclusively quasi use. 
These fabrics are analysed, it is changed and it is frozen, then it Héma-Québecnél it is placed, that handles one single of Québec public stem cell bank at the same time. 
From the umbilical cord treated as medical waste merely once blood like that can be obtained, that in stem cells rich, in this manner serious illnesses (for example leukaemia) makes that of shaking hands possible. 
Some weeks of his we celebrated that the thousandth umbilical cord blood sample got into our bank, and annually more than we plan the taking off of a thousand new samples. 
We start offering these for organ transplants already presumably on the front of the coming year - redefined Décary woman doctor, according to who the umbilical cord blood taking off program is most popular nowadays. 
Many mommies sad because he does not have an opportunity for this - this is in this manner really, with what it Héma-Québecnek he does not have the means to make this complex and costly program one which can be attained in all of Québec hospitals. 
Football - in a semifinal Impact 
Montreal Impact team yesterday 3:onto 1 Seattle Sounderst overcame it it USL-1 qualifying round of his, and it aggregated 4:qualified for the semi-finals with a 3 result. This was the match of the quarter-final with importance deciding in terms of the second and the totals, to which a row got in Saputo stadionban,. 
The deciding goal Antonio Ribeiro a midfielder obtained it in the 90. minute of the match. 
While the first half-time passed without a goal, in the second the montreali two of a team's midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino into the adversary's net found. 
From Sounders team alone Roger Levesque-nek succeeded to cheat Matt Jordan goalkeeper. 
Let us recall that Impact is 2 on his Friday first match:suffered 1 defeat in Starfire Complextől Tukwilában, Seattle's suburb. 
Impact Vancouver Whitecapsszel is playing in the semifinal. 
Saturday in the evening in Minnesota Thunder team, which it is on first match, 3:Whitecapstől, 4 reached out onto 1:onto 3 won, Whitecaps qualified for the semi-finals after all however 5:with a 4 aggregated result. 
Impact presumably on a Friday and on Sunday meets Whitecapsszel, but the matches correct his details on the today's day yet. 
In a nutshell - Kovalev victorious goal 
Canadiens favourite triad waits for the newer season getting ready. 
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn leaded triple superb attacks made by, and Canadiens triumphed over Florida Panthers finally 3:in 2 proportions from punisher shootings yesterday in the evening in Centre Bell. 
Kostitsyn, the meeting's star with a first number obtained a goal. Plekanec two, Kovalev locked the match, which the team is, with a goal pass though six of his preparation matches the fourth was a victory. 
Kovalev decided the match, who the shooting piece obtained one single of his goal. 
I am not yet getting ready - the Russian player warns. 
A match is needed for it yet in order for myself really to feel it in a form. 
The first tried to bring too much out from himself harmadban" - Guy Carbonneau noticed it. 
But I believe it, the match was glad about his final result because of that. 
He received a huge ovation. 
Charest northern endeavours 
The premier does not exclude it, that the choice begins this year yet 
Takes an end scarcely Liberális Párt assembly, Jean Charest traveled into the Jean talon of Québec immediately yesterday, where it is a new health minister, Yves Bolduc (on the left side) the today aims at the victory on a by-election to be kept. 
To force back our last big northern border: Jean Charest formulated this ambitious long-term aim Liberális Párt of Québec Lévis-ben lasted yesterday's his assembly. The speech was enriched with visual elements, the president tried to concentrate on the essence at the same time. 
His lecture in an alley, behind his back Moulin à images"-brings similar picture sequences projected. 
The three enormous ones fascinating uptakes followed each other projectively: the dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Québec Google Maps"-en, maps... 
So spectacular devices are sowed in electoral periods. 
The premier was not willing to guarantee that the choice will not begin already this year in autumn on the press conference anyway, although he added to it that his schedule is most tight. 
The northern plan onto the fourth butterfly the premier is related to Québec future for his vision, which is a new economic one, térség-ben incarnates. This includes a workforce convention to be signed with France, an agreement between single Canada and Europe and more conventions planned with Ontario. 
Lately the north (that is the northern area beginning with the 49. latitude) opening up towards it figured in the premier's speeches often, but never gave a lecture in this topic yet. 
The head of state was reduced to having explained it merely however, why keeps it north an enormous one with opportunities for a full goldmine. It did not talk about a time factor, investment sums on the other hand, neither from actual order of importance in the concern of the future projects. 
Only some emphasized a developmental opportunity: primarily the hydroelectric power plants, the forestry and particularly the mining, which the increase of the countries in the one catching up enlivens long, and the reconstruction of the state infrastructures. 
Nickel which can be hit on north, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond - Charest enumerated it. 
This area, which is that big two times,, than France's, our area's, Québec area. 
Not only at us, but in us can be found - the head of state repeated it, wishes to create a myth stressing that a national one is a founder with this. 
Emphasized that truth defined Québec development with the north on a large scale contact: the gold fever Abitibiben, the planning work of Québec, the James bay... 
This ours, our future! - added it to it after he examined the enormous map which can be found behind his back keeping a stagy pause. 
For Québec area 70%-án extending north includes a part of a Labrador, that Québec always for himself demanded - the premier announced it on the press conference. 
This, which all governments fixed, is our historical opinion. 
A borderline, in connection with which he does not have long time already, exists agreement, and if an occasion presents itself onto him, I confirm the same opinion again in the government's name - declared it. 
On the other hand, we have to think through our related viewpoint with the north again in the mirror of the climate change - the premier made a statement about it it he opens talking about northwest passage, which is the polar ice as a result of his melting in all years,. 
According to the premier's opinion, in this new geopolitical environment the occupation of the area important task. 
And what will be the area with his aborigines, the Indian ones and the Eskimos? 
The premier made a statement in such a way that Québec government spends emphasized attention on them, and much of their profit will originate from the plan, particularly for the young persons. 
The two ministers belonging to the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (latter Parti Québécois was the envoy of ungavai) the negotiation was started with approximately thirty local communities already. 
That Benoît Pelletier started his function a minister alley commission, in which Julie is Boulet, guided it (for traffic and for natural resources responsible minister) too plays an important role. 
The premier does not exclude it a large-scale meeting, not inevitably the opportunity of a summit meeting, where a common vision is created. 
A row would get to the development of north in accordance with the principles of the sustainable development anyway. 
Északi Terv tuned up, into a system occupied and will be environmentally friendly in one - the premier promised it. 
Jean Charest wrote this vision, which there is in harmony with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers preceding him, down for one like that. 
Just as well, than the earlier one liberálisok, we are thinking some other way: our aim it, that let us create new increase and developmental opportunities out of the challenges. 
This was one of the recurrent topic of that weekend anyway, that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50. anniversary of electing Jean Lesage as a party chairman on a Friday. 
The accepted decisions one suggest it, that Beauharnois power station Adélard-let it be declared Godbout gáttá. 
Between our party's politicians, many people it Hydro-Québecet founder Godbout, the quiet revolution and Lesage accomplishing the national dissemination of hydroelectric power plants, you are all Bourassa known as the father of the James bay-all of them knew it, how it is necessary to forge the future - Jean Charest declared it. 
The single other one quoted on the press conference - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, 1957 and prime minister between 1963 Roads to the North title his program. 
It Eastmain1a-Ruper in connection with the plan of the dam of a hydroelectric power plant Charest a president emphasized it, that into the firm place onto 2012 it is planned. 
Let this stay between us, but I plan it in such a way that I will be there - betrayed it híveinek, and loud burst of applause received his statement. 
The prime minister , who said that he will not be choice in 2008 yet in April, and presumably in 2009, did not exclude the opportunity of a vote to be kept with an autumn this year, which the law makes possible for him,. 
Stressed that his calendar is his winter now already however is, since undertook tasks on the federal council's Chinese meeting and the Québec-New York on a peak. 
The party meeting kept on the end of the week proved to be a distinguished platform for the liberal president onto the decompression of the nationalistic decisions, that without thinking quasi approved. It is related to a constitution mainly here from endeavours there is a word: the liberal party requires the acknowledgement of particularly Québec specific character in the constitution. 
It would be liked, if Québec could appoint the Canadian radioman's and a telecommunication council's members, and veto would be at these members' disposal in connection with the decisions brought in Québec. 
The opposition received Északi Terv capital dots skeptically on the other hand. 
Parti Québécois leader, Paulina Marois brought it up again it észak-québeci development politics, which the Landry government introduced in 2001,. 
According to Marois the got to power in 2003 a liberal government rejected the application of this politics. 
We would be heading ahead with a shock already today if they would not have done it - believed Marois woman Françoise Mercure-rel in an agreement, who the today to be kept Jean-Talon-i as a candidate nominated in vote. 
ADQ an oppositionist party stands up for the government accepting Északi Terv. 
We would like it however, if this would not be a sheer play - Sébastien Proulx noticed it party leader, who Mario returning from his freedom today is Dumont-t substituted it. 
Letters - a disgraced country 
Vic Toews, the Harper cabinet's minister (incidentally his forensic minister) took the liberty of it in summer last year, that let Louise Arbourt Kanada call it his shame. 
To revile a woman who fought for the truth incessantly in this manner and everything deserves our admiration - this reveals most much about the peoples surrounding the prime minister and Stephen Harper himself. 
This back our government, who did not transport the own citizen of a homeland all alone from among the concerned western countries, the guantánamói from concentration camp. 
This the government that does not take the fact into consideration perfectly, that Omar Khadr the commission of the crimes for which he was blamed was teenager yet on his time. 
This only government, which denied his word in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Geneva convention, and lets a child soldier to languish between inhuman circumstances. 
It is one single government, who makes a puppet theatre of the justice while a defendant examines his guilt,. 
Let us remember that it is UNICEF, Amnesty International only and the Canadian lawyers' association Omar Khadr home dekivery is required in order to be allowed to come in for a fair procedure in Canada. 
Our government turns a blind eye to the torture though: it does not count for him that a young adult was ruined totally now already psychically, and the many years of torture presumably onto a life sealed his fate. 
Although we are not aware of this yet now, but the insidious destruction of our rights, our freedom and our democracy is going on currently. Democracy: Harper expresses this word, which it is, incessantly he his mouth sounds as an empty phrase merely. 
A back came the time, when morals do not exist already long: arbitrarily may beat, may torment and may imprison any Canadian citizens for the leader of a government like that as it wish, that was in a minority this far (and we October may come yet after 14...?). 
Many electors believe that he may find the salvation at a party that praises the virtue, the law and the order. It is not seen that this government tramples on the values to which our country may have said thank you for his good news and his dignity with foot. 
Kind Toews lord, the shame rather this - let him not be looking for it somewhere else. 
Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwell oration 
Le Devoir appeared in the 17 number of a September a letter from Patrick J. Garvertől, Canadian Barrick Gold bánya substitute president and director general. 
Garver declares it after his Orwell explication, that the world a largest gold producer's company initiated six million dollar libel lawsuits three authors and against an impecunious publishing house an quasi in the interest of the initiation of a public debate. 
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision - particularly in the libel lawsuits - not the truth, but it is brought based on the law. 
Not surprising, that Garver kept silent about this fundamental difference. 
Would it be the best manner of the public debate really for Barrick Gold that he ruins anybody, with whose belt his point of view is conflicting,? 
Because of the outcome of the lawsuit independently Noir Canada title the authors of a book and his publisher have to spend considerable sums on the defence and onto fight in a unequal fight like that, where the army of the lawyers supported with the sources of the mining industry which cannot be used up quasi depends on the other side. 
The tactics that the defendant and a friendly agreement are ruined is used as anything else often in the so unequal fight they set, with which the contraries are not only silenced, but those who would try to deal with the question again are intimidated yet. 
He should have expounded his views before the public opinion rather if Barrick Gold wanted a public debate really. 
This happens some other way although somebody else is number in a country where Barrick Gold pursues an activity, each other are not struck by the disputing halves with stick generally in Canada, but their thoughts are related. 
There would have been enough because of this for the mine to open his books and his folders, and to get ready in a press, media, onto a real debate continued in publications, paying independent research teams that could have clarified light onto the question. 
But it seems that Barrick Gold is not confident about the public opinion, and brushes the applications written in the protection of Noir Canada authors and letters aside with a move. 
Garver a lord could explain it possibly, how may initiate a public debate if he ignores the opinion of this publicity at the same time? 
This word means the lawyers paid abundantly merely presumably in exchange of the deputy chair, not though the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept narrows down pretty much in this manner. 
The freedoms of speech are even their due in a democratic state. 
Barrick Gold does not understand it on the other hand - or does not want to understand it -, that Noir Canada authors and the publicity supports his publishers because he sentences the rough procedure of the mine chiefly. 
The public opinion ready to listen to Barrickot and to form a judgement, but this based on civilized argumentations, not though an for many people rather silencing would make it by way of a lawsuit aiming at. (The public debate Barrick Gold called upon Noir Canada authors recently in a writing anyway in connection with an expression, how they should abstain from the usage of this expression.) 
Barrick Gold procedure makes an open attack against the freedom of the university researches and the search of the truth beyond Garver surreal explications, that the building stones of all democratic societies. 
The procedure the authentic one denies it bought in whole one's to the quoting of sources, something to the debate being about the facts and their interpretation truth right, that the intellectual activities constitute grounds for him. 
If he may be similar to a Canada beside the burden of legal proceedings only in a country to study and to discuss topics like that, that the today's world's rich companies do not like them, who will add the courage to this then? 
Could do this according to those scientific norms if Barrick Gold would like an open and clear debate really, that Noir Canada authors apply. 
He has the right to answer to it. 
In our university circle already his long time we are able to handle the debates, divergences of opinions and conflicts. 
Barrick Gold thoughtless procedure shows it well, that his statement in a contrast nothing his mood to hold a debate. 
This the universities' world, all of them all mean loss to the institution of the Canadian public debates though. It is his time in order for the governments to introduce measures that limit the legal procedures initiated with the abuse aim like this finally here. 
Wall Street-i rescue operation - the democrats and the republicans agreed 
The Bush government and the congress a republican's and a democrat's leaders came to an agreement regarding the economic rescue operation finally yesterday, that the 1930 one évekbeli since big Great Depression the plan like this with largest cut. 
The plan with a value of 700 billion American dollar, the aim of which getting the monetary crisis raging since months on Wall Street under control is,, two of the congress's houses have to approve it yet. 
The essential points of the plan: the more efficient check of the realisation by way of the representatives; the new mechanisms insuring the repayment of the earmarked state monies; new provisions onto keeping the number of the houses reserved because of the lag of the payments on a level; an insight right came in for the help for companies' leaders his payment. 
Henry Paulson an American Minister's of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, the American chamber's of deputies president and Judd Gregg, in the negotiation participant Republican representative yesterday, the good news was announced before midnight with some minutes, after the two-day marathon negotiation ended. 
We put a big improvement towards a solution that will work efficiently on the markets - Henry Paulson declared it, the Bush government's representative. 
We made everything with the aim that we should save the real economy and the American citizens the present one hitting Wall Street because of a crisis - the democrat explained it representative. 
The most important viewpoint it, that the shock, the chaos will be enormous if we do not do this and the chaos in the Americans' everyday life - Judd Gregg said it Republican representative. 
The negotiation the last one it was sped up being afraid that a newer failure would have deleterious effect on the investors' mood in some clocks. 
Onto the agreement the stock exchange a deadline was provided to themselves until the morning opening of today. 
Two presidential candidates joined the negotiations being late for ready one appeared onto the agreement, it was expressed however, they are not glad that the situation intensified until the final ones. 
Peach Obama democrat a senator ascribed enlarging the agreement with elements like that to himself, than you are related to the conservation of the property with him paying to the leaders of the companies helped by the state for example rendelkezések. 
It is not a too happy thing when we ask the taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other peoples' irresponsibility. 
These steps on the other hand necessary - noticed it in an American television program. 
Would vote for the proposed plan when an other channel asked his adversary, John McCaint about it though, he in this manner válaszolt:"Szeretném to know the details, but my hopes yes. 
What I read in big lines, it already visible, that from a thing like that there is a word, that mindannyiunknak we have to digest it, and by way of which we can proceed. 
The opportunity that we should make nothing, simply unacceptable - said it. 
According to the 700 billion plan from the taxpayers' money the American financial institutions would buy his bad debts, something the unmarketable devices of a risk put out. 
A crisis extending through 14 months, which the real estate balloon bursting out started, preceded the plan. This first the risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage credits) leaded to his collapse, anything else spread then, hitelviszonyt embodier (commercial) onto stocks, and finally the liquid sources freezing up and the banks and caused financial institutions' stir. 
Republican representatives' single group defeated the first agreement draft on the last week. 
Is disappearing in that manner, we managed to extricate ourselves from this dead end, since the democrats consented for the government to provide the certain poisonous means of the companies in the heavy situation only rather, than buys it up. 
A provision, which prescribes it, got into the plan in the interest of the fact that all of the congress's members should be satisfied, that if the government has to carry the losses through five years in the framework of the program, the repossession of his sources may levy new taxes then his aim. 
As the part of the new plan first an 250 billion dollar details would be paid; another 100 billion may observe this, in as much the president finds it necessary. 
He should approve 350 billion dollars of the congress's remaining payment with newer vote. 
For the help into an exchange Washington obtains having a share in the favoured companies, on the ferry of which he receives a dividend of the profit,, and that after the crisis being over may market. 
The federal government will have an opportunity to delay the seizure of the real estates serving as the coverage of the mortgage credits affected in the plan. He may define the maximum value of the wage which can be paid out for companies' leaders affected by the crisis and severance pay besides. 
The plan elaborating I would love if the chamber of deputies would vote for the plan on the today's day already, on a Wednesday though the senate. 
Their efforts but yet always not sure, that the plan is approved. 
Since the statements opposing the plan were all over on one repeated yesterday the republicans, all among the democrats. 
Totally clear, that Washington does not hear Ön sound - Republican Scott Garrett declared it for his electors, who is the member of the house's financial commission. 
There are a yes, our serious financial problems. 
Yes, solutions exist. 
But like that is not, that it would favour taxpayers. 
Brad Sherman, the sceptic called a little congressional grouping a faction driving democrat a representative presents the things some other way, but manages to get onto the same conclusion. 
Four hundred distinguished economic specialists, between them three Nobel laureates a scholar wrote to us in order to demand the congress: let him not hurry, and examines it closely, which road selects - Sherman declared it yesterday. 
It was understood in the same moment again in Europe, that here from a worldwide crisis there is a word. 
The three Benelux states announced that 11, 2 are a billion euros following a crisis meeting (16,3 billion USA-dollár) Fortis nationalizes a consortium's of banks single part in a value. 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg turned into necessary one after French BNP Paribas announced it, does not buy up his competitor standing on the edge of the bankruptcy, after it is 2 million Euro (2,9 billion USA-dollár) lost as a result of the crisis of the united secondary mortgage credits in the State. 
With 85 thousand of Fortis employees the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies one. 
This not wasted money - made a statement to yesterday Wouter Bos Dutch Minister of Finance. 
Into an exchange we obtain vote and influence in the bank.

Paul Newman (1925-2008) - farewell from the actor idol 
His principal weakness was his beautiful azure eye according to his principal trump, others according to some people. 
Did the American actor with a charm smile get rid of his daffodil mirror once? 
Most, not too. 
Distance depended on that of a level through his bashfulness, his sensitivity and his natural talent from him the flashy style that is the element of the world's of artists real big monsters. 
But what grew over a huge orbit! 
Paul Newman died on 83 year ones, in pulmonary cancer on a Friday on his Connecticut possession. He was one of the last icon of the American cinema's heyday. 
There was monumental individuality less, than Brando, who he resembled,, and who counted as his rival on the screen through long time. His roles more moderate and was more vulnerable undoubtedly, he advertised the freedom and the demolition of the dramatic conventions though. 
Extraordinary children derive from the mixing of the bloods often. 
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a German Jewish father's and a mother's with Hungarian ancestry child. 
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic shapes of the American dream. 
He did not believe too much about himself, which increased his merits only,. 
Since was incarnated in him an, the "self-made MAN'S ideal and the Pacific one were broken for a fighter's ideal in war fan country. On the front of the 1950 years Yale on a university's drama academic specialisation, then the New York one Actor's Studióban studied, before the theatre, the television would have burst in and not much later into the cinema's world. 
The second attained a place in 1979 as a racing driver besides him having been the front-line fighter of the civil rights Le Mans-i on a daylong round. It was kept in mind as a sex symbol although Joanne Woodward lived with an actress in a happy marriage since 1958 beside all this. 
We may never find it out already now, he had what kind of drawbacks this mysterious one, reserved, his work called for an actor's life, who hated it the show-business his twinkling. This a riddle is left for ever already. 
A man was honest, in the most noble sense of the word. 
His death happened on seven of Paul Newman ends shocked the film fans: we may see it on the black screen of the memories only already in his big roles. 
Reviewing his oeuvre spins round before us the seventh American art, the cinema with continuous changes coloured more than fifty of his years. 
Gets mixed in our recollection Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid's charm cowboy (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) young man becoming estranged, in the role of who the cat is the boiling one on a tin roof title we may have seen it in Tennessee Williams processing in 1958. 
From the latter times (1990) we may remember him, who is aged, in sensitive Mr. Bridge picture his age confronts it, that his marriage did not fulfill his hopes. 
Paul Newmannek we may have seen many of his other faces in his films besides. 
Robert Wise Valaki up there title unforgettable shaping given in his film in the criminal boxer's with a stormy life, Rocky Graziano role. This it ploughs for James Dean originally - and after its death taken over - a role started Newman theatrical carreer in 1956. 
The big fuss played a nice criminal title in a brilliant creation, which won Oscar being owed for the best film in 1973,. 
Robert Rossen A swindler title his film brilliant (1961) was embittered, played a vengeful snooker player, and Martin Scorsese A returned in a similar role the colour of money title his film. This got to one single of his Oscar for his latter shaping in 1987 from nine nominations. 
Changing times, but always the same face: he was this. 
He was like this always. 
The change of eras hallmarked the period of his career. 
The younger ones mainly George Roy Hill Jégtörő title it is known by his cult film (1977), where Reggie is Dunlopot, an ice hockey team does not play his too customary trainer working with methods. 
Fan A signed by the Coen brothers big ugrás-ban it may have been seen again in 1994. 
The shorts Sam Mendes A the road of damnation title his film locked it in 2003: an ointment appeared in this last in a capo #Di mafia's role. 
As opposed to many cinema legends like that, who left the screen, Newman through long time in floodlight relatively soon was left over, although he sentenced Hollywood together with his twinkling, his luxury and his hypocrisy. 
Bertrand Tavernier French director not without all humour some considered, than it playing his living refutation: his game was too vigourous according to it. 
The trade was not gracious however always handsome Paul Newmannel, into whose lap the film roles fell in that manner only through long time,. 
Young and successful characters performed in rarer one after all: rather on the society's edge living person - you are a neurotic, an alcoholic, malicious one hopeless - played figures, the drift of who and was able to give back his rebellion with perfect authenticity. 
Newman showed a less known face of his as a director: his soul on deep one's his really decorous and sensitive man. 
It Rachel, Rachel directed in 1968 title in a film (that Margaret Laurence the adaption of a Canadian authoress's novel) his wife, Joanne Woodwarddal sketched a melancholic woman's delicate portrait in the leading role. 
It Harry and his son prepared in 1984 title, claims restrainment and sadness for his departed son, Scott in a drug overdose though with a radiant film memory. 
Innumerable of Newman admirers commemorated the actor yesterday. His neighbourhood friend and his old comrade-in-arms, Robert Redford (with who A is big balhé-ban and Butch Cassidy and Sundance kölyök-ben they were playing together) struck down in this manner because of a grief nyilatkozott:"Jelenléte made my life right and the world. 
The joy of generosity and the existence: this this superb actor was his vibrant individuality's, who we lost now, secret. 
His fight continued for the civil rights, the environment, the independent film production and his comments criticizing Hollywood debaucheries blur beside his legendary carreer. 
We may have seen his picture many times sauces, to smile at the packaging of sauces, biscuit and other foods. His act burns with a bad taste in the mouth although it kept it on the front of funny one yet. 
It was transferred to his foundation created for children suffering income in the illness always however deriving from the sellings like this. 
Newman never rested on his laurels: all the time committed was left for the trade. 
It left undermentioned sentences for five of his daughters in his letter írta:"Apátok was grateful for his lucky star unthinkably always and all the time. 
It was a privilege for me that I may have been here. 
For us privilege, that we may have accompanied a so brilliant and generous American artist's career all the way along. 
There was a sample citizen, above all. 
What you produce Zuschlag &#x26; in Tsai account factory? 
Soon, October on 8, the negotiation of the criminal procedure is underway against Zuschlag János and his companions begins. 
The politician and his companions with an especially considerable fraud committed continuously and businesslike in a criminal organization causing damage and other crimes - between many people with a forgery - it is accused. 
They made use of the won competition monies for their own aims according to the public prosecutor's department, the tasks justified his fulfilment with untrue accounts many times though. 
The state and municipal monies - his totality some 65 million forints - partly into Fiatal Baloldal cash register, single persons were wandering into his pocket partly. 
It was the method outlined by the detective authority that expense accounts like that withdrew the won competition monies on his basis, behind which there was not real fulfilment, and the associations never satisfied the undertaken obligation. 
The big part of accounts was false according to the indictment. 
To these the account blocks, the circular stamps were obtained on the Józsefváros market though on Kiskunhalas it was manufactured. 
And that onto the name of which firms let the account production happen, fell down on the Balaton highlands boulevard onto which Zuschlag János sent Lados István between many people. 
He had to pick guesthouses and restaurants out according to his latter statement. 
His of that place consumptions asked an account, onto the sample of which it was prepared next the between many people the youth one and Ministry of Sports, the social one and labour wallet, concerning the accounts to be submitted to Fővárosi Önkormányzat applications. 
Lados István signed these with his companion, Őri András, who is necessary to the gaining of the supports mostly according to our informations, in his majority reports wrote it. 
Lados his field trip one selected there was an ale house. 
By way of Zuschlagék issued, the catering establishment swelled up in 2003 according to two accounts for ninety of Biztos Pont Egyesület head groups it provided his dining. 
This many people but - according to the firm manager's statement - they would not have fitted simultaneously onto the catering establishment. 
In the same manner for Jobb Jövő - later Együtt for Harmadik Évezred name - an account made out on 2002 of a foundation's summers swarmed with formal and content mistakes. 
A Badacsonytomaj guesthouse more people were not top notch at ten men since only three were room an evening to sleep dream in him, the account was about one hundred and thirty guests after all. 
But you go over the top the imaginative one nyomtatvány-filling when Pigal Kft. dealing with hospitality likewise was marked, in the book-keeping of which - according to the information granted to the District attorney Office - they did not act for Jobb Jövő and onto Hoppá name sounding documents. 
The firm's leader, Farkas Győző the hvg.hu-nak related it, that when it was called in onto the public prosecutor's department and accounts were showed to him, knew it immediately, that from false documents there is a word. 
Our undertaking's name and our tax number figured on bad place on the rubber stamp. 
Added it to it: it was not correct beyond the formal reasons that a hundred men were accomodated according to the account, they have altogether eleven rooms, in which there are not this many rooms. 
Moreover the account onto catering sounded while their restaurant is out of order once already. 
The eager account makers did not look after it, that the Budapest travel agency picked out by them organizes foreign country roads only, in this manner foolishly Hungary traveling marked what do as a service on the cash account, what did not tally with the firm's account emission practice likewise. 
Moreover - than it lightened up in the course of that investigation - they made the VAT figure on the document, a traveling activity being directed into countries apart from European Union although was VAT-free. 
Between many people the measure of the VAT Hotel Révfülöp made a mistake on four documents exhibited by a Ltd. for him for Jobb Jövő, since the firm's service not the marked what do 25, but 15 percentile VATS burdens, the hotel's employees made out a mechanical account only beside this, the manufactured account was manual on the other hand. 
The exhibitors ruined an account with it beyond this, that road transport of goods was marked as a done activity in a firm's case - it lightened up through the public prosecutor's procedure -, that it was based on investment counsel originally firm not continued. 
Beside this likewise formal differences - inapposite account format, not real rubber stamp - dived out, That Együtt for Harmadik Évezred for a foundation, the XXI. for century Kulturális Egyesület and the accounts sounding for Biztos Pont false. 
Just like Ravenna Bt. you are the Kunfehértó one in a sport camp's case, that his representatives denied that they would have issued the accounts. 
The forgers did not pay attention to it for example, that birch church HIB a Ltd. consisted in that time under liquidation (2001), when an association's group dined there for Fiatal Város, just because of this the firm's liquidator - our knowledge - denied it, that he would have exhibited it the paper. 
Consciously exhibited 
Those who were aware of it form the account emitters' other group, that a fictitious account has to be made out. 
For Esély Budapest foundation Fiatal Baloldal - Együtt put out an account onto Ifjú Szocialista request for Harmadik Évezred foundation for him, for some four million forints. 
Collab a Ltd. leader - according to the indictment - one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic got it to the expense of the fictitious account. 
Zuschlagékkal collaborated likewise the currently Biogate Kft. under liquidation., that in 2003 for Jobb Jövő foundation, it supplied Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with accounts put out onto five million forints of value rudely, behind which commerce was not real. 
Flow of money, because it was ready accounts then lesztornózták, the organisations forgot to put this on stage in their documents already though. 
They belong to the next group of the firms emitting the account, that can be bound to the defendants. 
In this manner the fuel and with a Budapest seat dealing with motor vehicle trade, although Delta Trió who can be found is not the delivery delegate of a Ltd. Ukrainian manager there Kubatov Iván was. 
The firm made out more accounts for the selling of information technology devices in 2005 of his Octobers, his November and his December, in approximately 18 million forints of value. 
According to the data of the investigation these accounts the 2005. September Kiskunhalas Cash Investment standing under liquidation since the 14. a Ltd. bribed it. 
The manager of this firm was a Romanian man, to who Kubatov Iván would have sent it on with the firm likewise, related documents between 2002 and 2005. 
We know it in that manner, Kubatov admitted that the Ltd. issued an account in the name of the atlas in the course of the investigation, for Hoppá and Együtt for Harmadik Évezred for a foundation, and he recorded their offset. 
Romanian masons founded it for Kubatov Iván request definitely the tree bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt--. 
One of the firms, the reason of which it was according to the defendant that work was not received, were out of order however actually. 
Considered his profit as the undertakings after all, because his co-defendant, Szente Zsolt preparing the papers of the company foundations Zuschlaghoz put out accounts for solidifying associations in the firms' name onto a lawyer's request: for the atlas and it for a Y generation. 
Cash Investment, Delta Trió, the tree bani Jos, Jos Investment and Kubatov gave altogether 15 accounts to the organisations in Linaxtrade name, 14,2 in a million forints of value. 
The public prosecutor's department some believed, the 10 percentages of the sums indicated on the accounts and the VAT struck Kubatov hand. 
The man yet the Szi-Beri Bt-- too made use of it for the exhibition of fictitious accounts, these were manufactured for Biztos Pont application down. 
It a Y generation and the association handed in an application to the socialist party's non-profit organization in 2006 of his Januaries for Modern Magyarország, to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). 
They won 500-500 thousand forints, the sums were not devoted to the aims marked in the application though. 
The five fictitious accounts got from Works Team Kft. were submitted in order for this not to turn out the TMA-nak. 
These accounts were found anyway for Kemecsei Árpád the educational wallet being was in his office in the course of a house search. 
On the negotiation the defendants' single part, than did it on the public prosecutor's department, reports on the procession of the account production presumably. 
It may be interesting if the principal defendant, Zuschlag János himself decide that he reveals everything mostly. 
His statement until now since not too detailed, and did not do this yet although he promised that he speaks thorough repeatedly. 
Question, that this stands in the interest of him, netán for the big part of the harm, fifty the socialists struck a deal with him in exchange of the reimbursement of a million forints, and Zusi takes the rap. 
Who may have taken offence even by today anyway, since the applications of detaining him being aimed at his alleviation, that is putting him under house arrest fell on deaf ears continuously. 
While the perpetrators of the economic crimes not repaying it causing the much bigger damage may be walking freely, you are at least the end of the procedure is underway against them may be waited for in their own home, he does not have an opportunity for this. 
The psychology of the overbidding: why we publish more money? 
On the auctions the customers inclined to publish more money, to overestimate the merchandise. 
For this the known one - and apparently irrational - for a behaviour neurológiai-ökonómiai his bases managed to be revealed the New York one university for a neurologist's and an economist's researchers. 
Science title appeared in a journal the peoples do not want to be beaten in a competition with a type like that according to their study, than for example eBay's auction, a too tall price is paid rather because of this. 
The research this game tried to map his of the nervous system scheme with the help of experimental auctions. 
One of the volunteers' groups played the lottery, the other group attended a playful auction, while the functional one is magnetic resonance (fMRI) the experimental persons' active brain areas were examined with his method. 
The participants may have gained money in both games, but in the course of the auction game - in which essential element the overbidding of the other half - the striatum name, a complex under a cerebral cortex was activated intensively at the time of the loss of the game. 
This brain area plays a role beside more other functions the nervous system "önjutalmazó" his mechanism. 
The whipping of the price is explicable with the avoidance of the intense reaction of the striatum according to the researchers because of this. 
Onto the support of their theory the research team an economist's members continued a financial following examination. 
Three groups bade against a partner between various circumstances in a dog. 
The control group was informed how much are the real value of the respective product simply, and they made their bets. 
An other group was promised that 15 dollars are jutalmul if they get out of the game on a winner yet moreover they secure money. 
The third group received precisely 15 dollars before the auction on the other hand, but the group's members lost this money in case of a losing auction. 
The difference between the two groups so there were altogether so much that it is one for him the winning, other the losing was emphasized for him. 
The members of the team playing the neurologists' hypothesis proving himself however against the loss the control and at the winning group onto taller stakes they were willing. 
These results any kind of economy existing early from a theory cannot be deduced. 
They since until all this only with the joy of the victory and the kockázatthe phenomena which can be experienced on the auction were explained by means of being found. 
The neurological imagery methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories in that manner only, that now an we secured third explanation - Andrew Schotter, the professor of New York-i Egyetem economic faculty established it. 
Hepatitis: when we shall consult a doctor? 
Some half a billion men suffer on the world chronic hepatitis B or C mention the chronic liver disease among the driving mortality reasons though in an infection, on Hungary. 
Onto one hundred thousand can be done the number of the home hepatitis morass ones, but only seven thousand are handled, the reason of which: the patients do not know about it many times, that infected. 
The hepatitis name the collective noun of infectious liver harms caused by different viruses. 
Their symptoms a lot the similarity, feature the hepatitis and the jaundice, but their pathogens and the caused illnesses differ from each other. 
The hepatitis viruses because of the pathogen függően they expand in two capital forms: the hepatitis A and E through the human gut (was infectious for example with a food, water), the hepatitis B, C, D and the rest of the viruses with blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva). 
For travellers anyway with a worthy vaccination to defend itself A and B are not against a virus, against C vaccine. 
The hepatitis his symptoms come forward after the consumption of the infected food with two-three weeks, universally bad general condition, weakness, in the accompaniment of an abdominal complaint, nausea. 
Takes shape after these on the leather and the szemfehérjén visible jaundice, the stool clear, the urine becomes with a dark colour, the recovery may last for two-three weeks. 
Yearly one million men die worldwide in the more serious kind of the disease, the hepatitis B caused it in liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The capital reason of this, that tenth infected one receives medicinal treatment on all of them only according to estimates. 
The hepatitis C may have very serious consequences: may lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer if they do not treat it. 
Most infected one does not know about his illness, because the pathogen ravages the cells of the liver deceitfully, the first symptoms come forward after only 20-30 years in many cases. 
The early prevention, the accomplishment of the regular screenings are very important afterwards in this manner. 
In three groups at the average one much more the sickness like this: it went through blood transfusion before 1991 peoples, the drug consuming and the tattooed. 
On the world currently onto 200 million can be done the chronic hepatitis C by way of a virus the number of infected ones. 
With what the illness already a routine a labouratory examination may manifest it, at the time of the cognition of any symptoms with a unknown origin worthy to turn to the family doctor. 
Recognized in time the illness curable, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the organization, the virulence and preventable one ceases in this manner the development of the cancer. 
September the 30. the international day of the hepatitis, which organisations representing the patients first organized in 2004, apart on the world. 
His aim, that calls it the attention the viruses onto chronic hepatitis caused by, the reasons of his development and the significance of the early recognition of the illness. 
Does who believes in a god hurt it less? 
The religious faith works as a uniform painkiller, which may have facilitated the Catholic martyrs' death already, according to the result of a fresh research. 
It Oxfordi a university's scholars executed an interesting experiment, it was examined, how the belief in God influences the peoples' pain perception on a what kind of manner, got it news the British Telegraph. 
12 Catholic believers and this many atheists were given a share in electroshock while all of them studied a painting depicting Virgin Mary in the framework of the quite bizarre examination. 
The Catholic believers were able to exclude the big part of the pain according to the results. 
The one for which thank you can be said to a technique scanning the human brain it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate that part of their brain, that the pain is responsible for his regulation. 
The examination in the first one so research series, in which it is scholars, a philosopher beside academicians, and theologians buy a part from the university's different part. 
The examination was going on in such a way punctually entirely that a sparkling device was fixed to the experimental subject's left hand, which supplied the electroshock,. 
The researchers demanded the ones taking a part in the experiment that two paintings should be looked at strongly, Virgin Mary depicted by Sassoferrato in the 17. century and Leonardo da Vinci a lady looked in the 15. century with an ermine title his picture. 
The makers of the examination hoped that Virgin Mary sight brings about a uniform religious state between the believers, while the da Vinci picture it was elected because he did not differ from the other one too much and it was considered as with a relaxing effect. 
The experimental subjects half a clock was spent single MRI scanner in a machine, this 20 electroshock were received under time in four consecutive parts, while you are the one with a religious topic or the general picture it was looked at. 
The Catholics reported that secure was felt during Virgin Mary sight, who they ensured and they calmed down, peace filled them. 
The look of the picture with a religious topic they reported on fewer pains when Leonardo's creation was seen before themselves with 12 percentages meanwhile. 
Miguel rump psychologist, who himself is, took a part in the examination, believes it in that manner, that it is possible to achieve a similar effect with a picture with an any kind of powerful effect, at the atheists, it is necessary to find the suitable photo only. 
A picture like that we should find for who they feel very positively, than you are a mother a father. - the psychologist said it. 
Tom Wright an Anglican bishop welcomed the result of the research. 
The faith practising would be needed and a lot modify our personality in a case. - Wright added it to him. 
After the superb results already only that question, that if Leonardo, you are with a similar calibre the picture of painting one Madonnas is showed to the believers, a what kind of effect it would have on their pain regulation? 
Would qualitative Virgin Mary sight mean even better results? 
You are what you share from yourself 
Google may relate it on the birthday of a tenth: in the peoples' pocket onto at least so much can be found, than their head on the sky; knows it, where they were on holiday, what kind of consultations they go regularly to and what interests them. 
This does not burn always according to one of Eric Schmidt, the firm's capital men yet though. 
What is the Orwell one on the other hand with a phantom parallel bow sceptics concerns it, they dot the 2.0 essences of the web are not seen. 
Eric Schmidt recently it made a statement to the Financial Timesnak, that Google principal aim it, that let even more personal data be collected their users, this is necessary to it though, how the Google founders can hold to his original objective, which sounded in that manner,: we levy it into a system all of the world's information!. 
The sounded according to a Google leader the firm ten years of world perturber is on his front only yet after work it, that all of the information can be handled. 
Onto that question, Schmidt responded what five years will be going by: would like it, if Google would be top notch would answer the questions like that, than the what I shall do tomorrow? or the what kind of work would suit me really? - the softwares cannot answer the questions seeming the plain one like this till then entirely however, because enough are not known about the users. 
All internet surfers are not aware of him, that the earner words are fixed punctually in the course of the Internet searches, that they from what kind of IP address it was being looked for and how to the side the interested ones left following the search. 
The users may store it for example through Personalized Search started before with two years own szörfölési their background story, it may be played back, what you are looking for, what they clicked on, through these though on a long distance much better generates personalised hits then for them - Recommendations is based on logic then on the same one, with which the system recommends products and services to us based on our fixed preferences related early. 
What there is if they make use of my data against me if it is looked at, what I deal with? - the users, who are worried seeing Google data monopoly, ask it. 
The measure of the potential power represented by the firm rather in most cases may be frightening, not the remorse, because of the punishment truth fear, the desire for freedom, netán the rebellion against the power takes it out in the internet surfers the ellenreakciókat. 
Reinforced fact but, that all of the requested expressions are not only fixed, but they may be conveyed for third half in a justified case, nothing defends the internet surfers' personality rights in so law cases. 
In this direction the loudest example of the past times was an action harmonised against the Brazilian pedophiles possibly, in the course of which Google Orkut supported by it handed it over to the Brazilian government name from a community side with the pedophiles related, the informations making the identification possible. 
The internet surfers being worried about the personality rights may have sighed in a May yet on the other hand, when EFF is the firm hand in hand with electronic legal-aid office it proved his truth with a success on the court in return for FBI: according to these Google in the later ones can be forced with none of the dots of the constitution in that direction, that it asked any kind of information secretly by way of FBI let him hand it over. 
(The federal government fought for some fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand earner expressions successfully with a success at the same time, that with referring to the affirmation of the child protection law passed early with the years won, but did not manage to get the unique users' search lists after all, full web page expanding on two months concerned and keyword list to obtain.) 
Quite controversial so Google judgement: those who are afraid of the yielding of their personal data whip it, their intimate sphere and their privacy are chipped with it because they feel it in that manner, that Google services start being used and they come forward with the rebellion being the multinational company firms' glittering in the conservative image due against them. 
During this the American geek culture and enthusiastic computerised fans appearing in several countries for it, activists, his wilding condensing users the big firms' next generation, the cool one korporáció-- sees it in them, a contrast with his rival, because of Windows világconquering with booked Microsoft, onto any amount let both struggle for an aim on the same one. 
This may happen because of that, does not ask money for his applications because Google does not ask identification code of his users on the manner differing from Microsoft, the open one, free, a source code and a software package lasted freshly for much more available one, for more youthful one continuously, coolabbnak affects the official software giant's practice. 
May happen however because the geeks understand the most problematic relation of the personality rights and the internet punctually, That dot it one of the keywords of years expressed the often, the web were over 2.0 pulled over after himself. 
The web 2.0 are not about something else, than from the collaboration, from that direction, that we leave traces deliberately and we take advantage of the communicational channels being at our disposal and while these his measure changes individually, the essence the same one: we show our face. 
An average young person may lead a profile on more community sides Facebooktól Xangáig, these may link it to other services, than for example Twitterrel, you are the musical one his customs listing last.fm-mel, all of them may bind these into follower systems like that then, than you are FriendFeed Blip.fm, a blog, on which their newest photograph galleries appear automatically, may be guided besides, that the Flickr-en you are Picasán store. 
While several are so exemplary from a case we may read, from which is evident: the girlfriend realizes it seeing the morning photograph deluge of the common friendly circle easily, who his fraudulent friend spent the evening with how or may fire a firm's employee only because of that, because the honest one writes down its opinion of the upper leadership in his blog: a commissioner's, the privacy's concept totally reinterpreted by now. 
It consists of the person who lives an on-line life, what he shows from himself, we may formulate it with this behind the today's young persons' behaviour nestling principle. 
You are who wants to conceal something though at least wants to go round the Google monopoly, it may do it (starting Google search engine for example using, but at the same time trace deliberately not letting Scroogle-lal). 
Not few examples the number of those peoples, who deliberately do not register onto community sides, how he should not be allowed to be to find them, Google on-line applications because of the word processor to the picture handler and a news reader it is possible to induce it through alternative versions, that enormous server parks are not attached to by them and that it is not compiled from us it existed till now best profile. 
The public opinion not too expects it so much secretly when Google shows himself in his true colours. 
The company present his dollar value is worth more to 156 billion, than #IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) you are Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the advertising agencies' incomes, the services introduced in the pace accelerating continually serious headache is not only caused for Microsoft though, but for a number other software developer. 
The critical observers find it however beside these the counterpoints seeming to be the alarming one: the upper leadership rejected the employees' protest with completeness for example, after duplájára raised the company kindergarten's prize, the company management found it too costly the employees daily optionally his repeated catering, it is all dwarfed by the fact that Google bowed down before the Chinese government in 2006 yet however and the firm filters all hits, which offend the good taste, out in the sense of their agreement, concerning the interests of my Chinese overhead. 
One of the firm's inner rules sound in that manner, that ahead a new service is not announced, only then, when it already into a usage purchasable, but it sure, the forthcoming months and the reasonable problems of years may agitate the world on a newer dot: while some people some believe, Google book and magazinszkennelési and -archiválási his project puts on sizes like that, that the firm has to face American Supreme Court soon, others dread Health system, in this we may build up a full hygienic profile from ourselves our previous diagnoses, our doctors and our problems. 
That fact though, that Google builds up a genetic database, that sci-fi may give good stock to authors' next generation, popular Cory Doctorow short story, Scroogled a dot writes that future down with Orwell overtones, in which a man only from Google data alarmingly well can be approached.

From the monetary crisis from European sheets' visual angle 
The European sheets driving in their Tuesday commentaries devoted to the international monetary crisis deepening continually already second September they keep recalling 11. 
We may say thank you for the global financial catastrophe to the American president - accuses the Roman one La Repubblica - the president even in that direction was able to marshal his own party that behind a bill knocked up hastily, the aim of which the redress of the desperate situation is,... 
Instead of newer Pearl Harbour, that Warren Buffett billion investor mentioned, more appropriate second September to talk about 11. 
The Madrid press's single part sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
The of that place political leadership's deficiency made the global economy be near the collapse according to El Mundo sight. 
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system grows to one, and the whole world will suffer from this afterwards. 
Bush's plan was not perfect though, that danger is threatening however after the congressional vote, that Washington does not offer political device for the treatment of the crisis. 
The global economy is in the air - just when one of the largest transformations of the story of the capitalism are going on. 
It is not possible to leave the threat out of consideration long - the Geneva one shows signs of him Tages-Anzeiger. 
Single states may throw a lifebelt to the staggering financial institutions yet today, and the taxpayers may save them from the bankruptcy situation with his money. 
Though if even more banks collapse similarly to domino cubes, then the finances, neither newer improvisations will not be sufficient. 
On a long distance in that direction there is need in order for European Union's member states to put themselves through their national selfishness, and let it be centralized the articulated check above money markets. 
Only on a Monday more than the ailing financial institutions received 100 billion euros - reminds Vienna Der Standard, according to which increasingly more real those scruples, that they have to reach into the European taxpayers' pocket in the interest of the redress of the crisis deeply similarly to the Americans. 
EU did not deal with the crisis till now sincerely, that cunamiként sweeps across the old continent. 
The ambulances do not need one hundred billion immediately euros to flutter, would be good if it would be fixed on the other hand: in which case reasonable to handle the taxpayers' money because of the prevention of the bigger harm. 
The buzzing the intelligent car imitates his flying 
We the best method would be suitable for the avoidance of the collision onto the development of technologies, if the nature is not the imitation of obstacle sensors appearing in his world? 
For example that of the bees. 
In Japan ongoing CEATEC-en the droning bees granted the strategic initial thought in a presented surprising project Nissan his engineers it, how the next generation of the systems avoiding the collision should be built how. 
Nissan built it in cooperation with the Tokyo university the BR23C type, bioutánzatú car robot leader system, an robotized mini car, which the bees invested with his characteristics,, with that final aim, that let a system that eliminates all of the collisions further his forming. 
All bees develop his own oval shaped personal space during flying, that is similar to our safety protecting cover very much effectively - Kazuhhiro Doi, technological PR explained it on the exhibition and research-developmental trademark headmaster. 
Important his role for the compound eye of the bee, which more are in all directions, than 300 spontoon are able to see in an optic angle. 
It to the copying of the function of a compound eye the engineers handled the idea of the laser distance metre. 
This the BR23C 180 spontoon identify the obstacles inside 2 metre distances in a field of vision, calculates their distance, and sends a sign to the deck microprocessor, which is transformed into an operation being aimed at the avoidance of the collision promptly,. 
The cognition of the obstacle occurs under the fraction of the second, then the car robot imitating the motions of the bee, the collision changes a direction for his wheels promptly his avoidance with a necessary measure with turning him away. 
On a manner differing from any present systems, this it avoiding a manoeuvre takes place on a totally instinctive manner. 
The car robot would not be able to react rather quickly if he would not be this in this manner it, that let him avoid the obstacles - Toshiyuki Andoh, Mobilitás Laboratórium and the car robot explain it the leader of a project. 
On an instinctive manner and has to respond promptly, since this technology is the safety protecting cover mostly for his vulnerable and innermost layer suits, for a layer like that, on which the collision is considered one of which clear cannot be kept currently within. 
The whole process has to reflect what a bee makes in order that he should avoid other bees. 
This process has to take place under a glance. 
Though, on the manner differing from the bees, the difference may not be directed upwards, downwards you are diagonally, may be two-dimensional only, and only the wheels elfordíthatóságának his direction. 
On a manner like this for the bees onto the evasion of the rest of the bees instead of an endless opportunity standing for a provision here only the rotating motion and accelerating, and the deceleration was applied the car robot as an opportunity being available. 
The BR23C lithium polymer applies batteries, which are easier, and bigger their energy density, what means that their lifetime is longer, than the lithium ion that of a variant. 
According to Andoh the instinctive intelligent reaction the important one, not onto the processing of the data, yet onto storing him less truth ability. 
For this construction second has to digest altogether some input signs and to react onto them. 
There is not need in that direction, that let him preserve them, and let him react with the intuitive logic being based on the data of the previous manoeuvres, only some dozens use a kilobyte of memory continuously in this manner. 
There is not need gigabyte, you are a megabyte just greatness onto memories. 
This first step the immediate evasion maid to the development of technology, which may march in inside ten years based on Nissan's estimate, the mass production into cars. 
The unit may mean an additional opportunity of application building with the GPS satellite navigation system, that let it lead the motorist to the granted final goal with the avoidance of underway obstacles. 
The terribly expensive child had a good reputation 
His written variant was ready in the more details applicable, for the 700 billion dollar economic rescue equipment laws taking aim at the purchasing of the banks' bad credits. 
First the half of the sum is spent round. 
According to the east coast time the Saturday the congressional leaders came to an understanding on all in the course of newer negotiations lasting after midnight in a debate lasting long since days around 700 billion dollar rescue equipments - Reuters reported it. 
We attained a serious improvement - Nancy Pelosi, the American chamber of deputies announced it a democrat's president, according to who there is putting down the agreement on paper only already back. 
From the packet both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain had compromise begot favoured it. 
Henry Paulson a Minister of Finance declared it being about the result of the compromise: the program to work there will be a tooth and efficient one, though onto additional agendas there is need. This is not about the rescue of Wall Street according to Pelosi, but from the inversion of the cart of the economy. 
The written variant of the packet the Asian markets according to Washington time on Sunday the 8 opening of an evening (that is according to Central European Time Monday dawn two clocks) it was made public, but did not cause spectacular running-in on the stock exchanges. 
From the program acting, 2008. yearly economic one vészstabilizálási law from the draft of a measure answering to a name the chamber of deputies votes on the law first on a Monday, the row will be on the senate then. 
George W. Bush president a Saturday spoke in the evening Pelosival, it was welcomed in the White House then arrived from the agreement news. 
We are satisfied we value the efforts of the two parties with the progress achieved with the night and large in order for our money markets to be stabilized and let our economy be protected - Tony Fratto, the White House's spokesman declared it. 
The program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which would have been about it, anyway, that the 700 billion dollars an it it would have been spent for the shopping of stocks with credit background with a bad quality in one. 
Now in first circle the 700 billion sums it is possible to spend his half in such a way at worst that they make use of 250 billion promptly after the congress expectedly on a Monday votes in the case, from this ministry of Finance credit background, buys stocks with bad classification, the fate of another 100 billion dollars depends on the president's decision though. 
A separate body checks the program then, in which Federal Reserve president takes a part,. 
The spending of his 700 billion other halves depends on the congress's newer decision. 
Ministry of Finance may apply combined tactics in the sense of the law: may buy bad credits, mortgages and stocks with mortgage background simultaneously, concerning poisonous credits with an other type. 
The shopping in the framework of auctions and may happen directly - the ministry's officers announced it. 
The measure makes it possible for the affected firms in order for a part to be taken in an insurance program, where the financial wallet guarantees the devices giving rise to the concern, for what the companies pay a suitable prize to the expected harms then. 
Henry Paulson related it: the law grants the necessary devices in that manner that let 700 billion dollars be left even the American financial system urgent his claims, even from the wide-ranging purchasing of the bad devices, insuring them even, from the avoidance of a system risk entailing a big financial institution's collapse even let there be a word. 
We take the necessary steps that we should be ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it is signed - added it to it. 
Into the trouble the chiefs of banks waiting for avoided and state help may count on it on the other hand, that their withdrawal money - that the overseas slang simply for a golden parachute faithful - the government limits it. 
A row, an extra gets to the limitation of the payments in certain cases only the bars depend on it, on a what kind of manner ministry of Finance provides help. 
Reports it in the essence of the limitation, that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, a surplus tax is imposed on the golden parachute, unless it is not pensioned off the levitézlett director of a bank. 
The government intercedes then aggressively at the time of the direct shopping of the bad credits, let the managerial monies not be exaggerated in order for him to insure it. 
To the picture it belongs to him that the existing golden parachute contracts do not change, the limitation concerns the new ones in order to be motivated in this manner in the program only truth participation. 
This first one makes it be raining in the American history, that a limitation will be law in validity regarding the general managers' salary - the chamber of deputies commented on the measure for financial services for his responsible commission his president, the democrat party Barney Frank. 
The state obtains a right in participant banks in the program beside this onto the share acquisition, the taxpayers' risk decreases in this manner, since they may win the transaction finally, as soon as the economy and the saved bank gets back on its feet together with him. 
The bill implies it, that the congress has to introduce a proposal like that for the president in the next five years, that takes action on it, as what it is possible to send the expected losses back for the taxpayers from the financial sector. 
They were like that on both sides of course. 
This not for what the American citizens asked us, that is it does not protect taxpayers' dollars - California Darrell Issa declared it Republican representative. 
An Ohio democrat's colleague, Mary Kaptur some believed: the same people who are responsible for the breakdown of Wall Street promoted the measures.

The press review of the German language area 
The right camp untouched, the electors became more conscious one inside the camp only - Der Spiegel analyses CSU weak performance in this manner in Bavaria. 
Haider ready Austria kormányonto him soaking, that the red-black coalition is prevented. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
Franz Walter, the revolution of Bavaria gobble up his fathers in the Internet expense of the left-wing German newsmagazine title CSU analyses his reasons in the article of his dramatic defeat. 
CSU erosion began before it with good one already according to the known political scientist, that the sad Beckstein-Huber a duo would have taken his office. 
The Christian Socialist ones renewed Bavaria through decades - and these modern citizens turn away from them just now. 
The new era at the same time all of the Christian democracy, in this manner Angela Merkel problem. 
The failure was not surprising for CSU entirely, but a process ended on Sunday, that quasi exactly ten of his years can be rendered probable was: a state party's indisputable hegemony ceased. 
Already ten of his years, CSU landed on 1998 on 47,7 percentages, first since the fifty years under the 50 percentile levels. 
This three of his years were repeated 2005 Bundestag on choices, so it kept recalling so much yet Stoiber in an era. 
The modernisation executed consistently in the province is the reason of this by way of CSU, which gobbles up his parents,. 
Sociologists already 40 of his years prophesy this, but you are mistaken by big one in the pace. May not have been one without consequences after all however the electors onto CSU faithfulness the secularisation, the educational results, the east and észak-németek his immigration into the developing regions of Bavaria. 
The modernisation entails the increase of the opportunities together, and the political consequences of this visible. 
The right camp untouched, the electors became more conscious one, more critical one, more headstrong ones inside the camp only. 
Prominent it, that the classic civil groups receded away mostly just in the last weeks the CSU-tól; with a free occupation, the craftsmen, it sat for the final examinations and the ones with a higher qualification. 
Here already under 40 percentages CSU support shrank.

It SPÖ it ÖVP-vel wishes to negotiate. 
ÖVP it prohibits SPÖ intervention his internal affairs. 
BZÖ appears for one opened into all directions onto the negotiations, the green ones do not want to reconcile about the coalition yet. 
The choice occurred, everything revolves around the coalition now; the party leaders let insight hardly into their cards in the debate organized in the public television. 
A Werner Faymann SPÖ president confirmed it its views, that it ÖVP-vel wishes to negotiate. 
It SPÖ it wants to be indicative of it that the cooperation of the two parties is possible still - this exists in single provinces and the social partnership. 
The question, that a coalition Wilhelm Moltererrel - present ÖVP with a president, than with a vice-chancellor away is top notch to imagine -, Faymann let it open. 
Than composed, the Schüssel-Molterer course it was voted down whatever. 
Repeating this direction does not come up. 
Molterer responded to the red offers carefully.

Playpen Lívia, it called Európai Néppár for educational segregation in his Fidesz woman member's of parliament message given to a plenum as one of the capital orators of the vocational discussion the attention, because this Romany is one of the most serious one hitting children infringement and this most serious obstacle of them making good moreover. 
The high-level conference - in the French presidency's name - Xavier Bertrand, French employment and social minister, and Vladimir Spidla, a responsible European commissioner opened it for the employment, the social cases and the equal opportunity. 
Onto the discussion called the governments, the European social partners and the equal opportunity a most considerable European defender of rights and civil organisations' representatives took up space on an area. 
Playpen - according to his Fidesz EP parliamentary panel's press office - reminded, that work uptake the Romanies are driven out owing to their low education from the labour market primarily beside differentiation which can be experienced. 
The Romany is not for young persons' great majority his secondary qualification, and their insignificant part may obtain a higher qualification only as a result of the beginner's education with a bad quality. 
A playpen emphasized it furthermore, that, than there are a fundamental human right, the crucial role of the education in the validation of the other human rights. 
The Romany into children's early education truth an investment may mean his affirmation to the European Union member states' economy. 
According to the woman member of parliament necessary, these contexts in the widest circle - Romanies and not between Romanies - to make realize. 
Since at what the Romany starts it early student the school, his chances increase in that manner in that direction, that let the labour market turn into his productive members; they contribute to the national budget through the taxes paid after the incomes and consumption. 
The Romanies have to provide it for the qualitative education on the right of their European union citizenship truth their right, and it is necessary to guarantee it it low standard and the liquidation of their separated education - Járóka Lívia emphasized it. 
According to the woman member of parliament necessary European Union aim and acting-oriented his champing to the immediate acceleration of the school desegregation processes, to this the existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives correct observing with fundamental importance. 
It is necessary to break the vicious circle of the poverty, segregation, unemployment, it is necessary to grant it the Romany children the democratic space got it opportunities, that let them be allowed to contribute to Europe's future as a citizen with a full right - a playpen required it. 
In the ticket of the Európai Év of the equal opportunity to be guaranteed for everybody since the last year's Berlin meeting annually organizing avoiding European equal opportunity one the aim of a peak, that let the equal opportunity set on the European and member state level insure a single forum and to the promotion of the aims of a differentiation exemption. 
CSU: mercy onto transitional time 
They decide on the end of October the was a wash-out Huber-Beckstein from a duo's fate 
Heads did not fall yet despite the shameful electoral fall, the disputation of the personal issues was adjourned temporarily on Bavarian CSU peaks. 
Erwin Huber party chairman and Günther Beckstein a province premier may remain seated yet, question, till when the mercy lasts. 
An extraordinary party congress will decide about the fate of the tandem enduring the 17 percentile catastrophic vote losses on the last weekend of October. 
The members of the couple criticized a lot demonstrated it whatever: they do not insist on their chair with all of their strength. 
The faction and the base tried to calm down his furious members with this, who with a day the Bavarian one cunami" personal consequences were required because of the absolute majority's loss. 
With five years before - true, yet on the peak of his orbit being with Edmund Stoiber command - the Christian social union 60,7 obtained a percentage, now on the other hand, with a year after the coup against Stoiber only 43,their strength was enough for 4 percentages. 
CSU was an autocrat through 46 years in German Bavaria giving 18 of the percentages of GDP. 
The conservatives count high for the Hungarian economy in a crucial noon province, the future in the future though they are forced to a coalition anyway. 
Horst Seehofer counting as Huber possible successor as one of the first signs of restructuring inside a party vice president and federal agrárminiszter too receives place in the narrow spotter team that is the liberal one FDP-vel, a potential Munich governmental one begins enquiring negotiations with Szabad Választó getting organized concerned along the right values from a coalition. 
The strange grimace of the fate, that that Gabriele Pauli gets into the legislation on Szabad Választó list, the appearance of who against Stoiber the Huber-Beckstein a couple took advantage of it as a coup opportunity, then they handled the municipal woman politician aiming at the big one relentlessly though. 
CSU leaders spend all of their energy on it being stabilized somehow now Becksteint. 
It will receive an active role till now in the transition the threads from the background weaving Stoiber, the there was a province premier and a former CSU president's political career called it his bitterest day September 28. 
Huber loosened some bilious comments on a Monday towards CDU, much more supports would have been deserved according to it from the sister party. 
Somebody else CSU-s politicians interpreted the defeat in such a way that it is a warning the CDU-nak and Angela Merkel. 
Merkel may not be a chancellor following due Bundestag choice in his 2009 Septembers, if the 2005 national one is considerable in a success role playing CSU-t it is not turned around somehow with common strength. 
CSU soil losing will not influence the Berlin big coalition negatively according to Merkel concealing his disappointment difficultly because of a fiasco. 
What is relative of course: the stricken one CSU-t shaking hands will not be easier, the social democrats' crisis though keeps. 
It SPD achieved his weakest result with 18,6 percentages in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukasenko opposition: 110-0 
One single oppositionist representative did not get into the White Russian parliament after the Sunday choices. 
This Alekszandr Lukasenko guided it with prosperity ensured in a country and stability according to the Russian observers, the European safety one and Együttműködési Szervezet (EBESZ) with illegitimacies committed at the time of the poll however explicable. 
From the 43 countries EBESZ sending 450 observers did not acknowledge the choices. 
Although the one hundred and ten head legislations of the 10 million countries are baggy his decade misses the opposition, it was united before the yesterday's choices Demokratikus Erő (ODSZ) an opposition rounded up on a name hoped for it sincerely, that after the constitutional amendment the 2006 one, on choices with debated cleanness his presidential assignment negyedszer too regenerative Lukasenko allows the appearance of some oppositionist representatives in the parliament this time. 
ODSZ forewent boycott considered on the trailer in this manner. 
It was stated in the background of the oppositionist waitings that it is Belarus depending on Russia increasingly more strongly economically - that the Russian natural gas import increasing in price continuously took out a loan for his reduction, and Beltranszgaz possessing the pipelines crossing the country contributed to it into a Russian hand his allocation - wished to repair his relation with EU, where Lukasenko and more high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry permit because of the White Russian political settlement classified as the undemocratic one. 
Onto easing off beforehand indicated that EBESZ is the positive one rather at the time of the assessment of the election campaign onto shifts, not though onto the deficiencies - for example the opposition candidates harmadának onto forbidding him from a departure - put the emphasis. 
EBESZ Monday express meaning disapproved of the campaign already however - that the opposition candidates may not have appeared in the press practically on his row - and particularly it, that the opposition may not have been present the counting of the votes. 
Improvement which can be perceived after all according to the opposition together with this in the political system: the political prisoners got to release, and Minsk onto smaller confrontation with willing Moscow, denied in the future from Grúzia secessionist Dél-Oszétia and Abházia acknowledgement, although Russia - with which Belarus forms federal state on paper - a month of his considers the two areas independent one already. 
- We put two steps ahead, one back, but the most important one, that the dialogue began Belarus and between EU - Alekszandr Milinkevics called it our sheet. 
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election desirable, that let this remain, it, that the power got frightened of it, that into the weightless parliament let him let in an oppositionist one even. 
The opposition does not plan direct actions upon seeing the results, tries to send his message being about the necessity of the economic reforms rather to the electors. 
- We have many troubles of course with this, we have to print the oppositionist sheets in Russia, the local authorities put obstacles in the way of the dissemination, but I see it in this manner, that increasingly more people favour the change, the aged ones in his circle - Milinkevics said it, indicating it, that Lukasenko regime, which considers the creation of the social safety his principal result,, even the layer of the pensioners supported mostly officially does not find it suitable. 
- Because of the country's indebtedness, the increase of the commercial deficit the question of time the social safety quoting the silence of the cemetery getting disturbed - believed Milinkevics. 
The Russian observers qualified the choices as democratic opposite the oppositionist politician. 
Independent Szergej Lebegyev leading the mission of Állam Közösség Ria Novosztyi told it to a Russian news agency: not for the words, but for the acts believe the peoples, in this manner the opposition's deficiency not somebody else, than the evidence of the White Russian electors' maturity. 
Brunetta: Breakfast exclusively before working hours 
Revolving doors were found on a single manner in Chigi Palota story installing the employees who- and riding slowly. 
From the today's day this new measure takes effect against the wangling ones, onto filtering them out, who block, they go away to drink a coffee in working hours next. 
The naplopóellenes novelty Renato Brunetta presented it today onto an administrative minister's and Mauro Masi, the prime minister office's main secret. 
The revolving gates - Brunetta said it - increasing the right and him reducing more efficient working, the absences and the services is served 
A new, more responsible and clearer period follows. 
This real reform - Brunetta emphasized it. 
The equipment of some buildings of the cabinet ends with Chigi Palota. 
According to Masi the revolving gates installing from a symbolic viewpoint important. 
From the employees' part we did not experience resistance - the secretary general confirmed it its views: The employees approved the measure, everybody collaborated. 
In brief his end the having breakfast in working hours, there are not more coffee and brioche. 
Brunetta advises it smiling: a good little capuccino in the morning at the time of seven, onto miracles capable 
On Roman Közigazgatási Főiskola 
the minister outlined it on kept discussion: employees' absences because of an illness decreased by 50 percentages in the public-sector under three months, what means an one going to more work with sixty thousand heads under a year. 
Added to it that it would be necessary to make the Italian public administration more efficient at the same time 
, The wage dynamics of which - according to the minister - the latter one was that big two times in 8-10 years, than that of the private sector, and exceeded the inflation rate by good one. 
More thousand public servants gathered at the same time, joining the submission favoured by the Italian environment protection one and his Fogyasztóvédelmi Egyesületek Szervezet, how he should protest the Brunetta-féle against the regulations of an order. 
The tireless idlers' army is growing continuously while the administrative minister is flaunting the data supporting the suppression of absences because of the illness - the consumer protection association writes it. 
Italy apart more thousand honest and administrative employees working firmly gathered in order to declare war on the illegal regulations of the order. 
The abolition of additional sick pay going regularly to an illness which can be traced back the of service causes between many people is attacked at the regional administrative court, the employees on the sick-leave the prolongation of the residential time of a home, which signifies that period,, on which the visitor may appear within, and more other, viewpoints taken in new provisions prescribed by the minister. 
Workplace accidents: according to Napolitano the prevention at all this more important 
2.500 workplace accidents happen every day in Italy, from which one with 3 deaths, 27 end with lasting disability though. 
Nearly 1.200 deaths happened on the workplaces in 2007 according to his workplace accident insurance data. 
The numbers are evidence of the earnestness of a phenomenon that is even today one for the frequentest mortality reasons, and so much require victim almost two times, than the homicide. 
Anmil organizes it with 58. occasion in all of Italy's counties on the today's day, the day of the victims of the workplace accidents kept on the second Sunday of October traditionally, that the institutions, the social organisations call it and the attention of the mass communication onto this dramatic problem. 
The alarming data announced by Anmil, and the tragic events of the latter days support it, that the workplace accidents the prevention plays an important role outstandingly - Giorgio Napolitano declared it president of the republic Pietro Mercandellihez, to his workplace Baleseti Rokkantak Nemzeti Egyesület president sent his message. 
The head of state the workplace prevention, the accident praised the association's persistent commitment sincerely suffered employees' protections of interest, the help of the victims' family members and the public opinion responsive one his item. 
They give rise to natural and indignation distributed by everybody sincerely the one with a character like this, their sizes caught the media and the tragedies arousing the interest of the public opinion, though in the reality day after day dramatic, again and we have to confront cases being repeated again. 
Napolitano admits it openly: we are short of funds undoubtedly, the financing of the education and information with deciding significance. 
On emphasized one important they take aim at the direct information of taking the initiative inside the school, which the young persons being on the threshold of entering the world of the work are,. 
Our duty to maintain the interest for the phenomenon, not to allow the attention to languish regarding the social importance of the question, and onto more efficient measures there is need, for which it is necessary to obtain validity. 
The House's of Commons president Gianfranco Fini from his own part emphasized it, that the workplace accidents ending with the death how serious, mindannyiunk his conscience they have inculpatory social significance, the institutions are demanded of that this should be ended as soon as possible though. 
The data concerning the workplace accidents show a mild improvement, but the number of the deaths with a character like this yet always astonishingly tall - Pietro Mercandelli, Anmil president noticed it. 
We would not like it at the same time if this downward tendency, decreasing one would be accompanied by attention because the attention is a dot at the time of his slackening the largest tragedies happen. 
We think that we do not do everything always yet on a general level onto overcoming the phenomenon, which would be solvable through a complex action program,. 
Our opinion onto severer supervision and check there would be need - Mercandelli emphasized it - and onto a sharper intervention on the area of the workforce training, started because of the school education already. 
Onto additional efforts there is need the information of the public opinion and responsive one his item in the interest of him - added it to it. 
Onto which there would be need however mostly, the single more responsible employer's environment opposite a phenomenon that means a problem with a social level. 
Mercandelli criticized the gradual decay of the compensation safety net provided for the victims of the workplace accidents following this, and the aid tendency towards which the system is drifting in the latter years. 
The aim so it, that we give it back the insurance provided it for the employees safety, because the accident sufferers' fate may not depend the codification where arbitrary, where though distributing his measures. 
Hearing impairment may be caused it MP3 players 
The portable player like that may cause enduring hearing impairment apparatus until longer time and his hush happening on tall volume, than for example it MP3 apparatus - 
European Commission, EU announced it in his meaning published in Brussels new and the scientific commission of hygienic risks identified newly (SCENIHR) accross referring to the expert opinion made public on the today's day. 
The expert opinion shows that 5-10 are enduring in a percentage hearing impairment they may suffer, who through five years daily at a clock until longer time, their portable music player is listened to with tall volume - legible in the explanation. 
Alarming, that those young persons, who in mass and tall portable music players working on volume and mobile phones are used often, they are not aware of it, that their hearing may be harmed irreversibly - Meglena Kuneva said it. 
The scientific surveys signal an indisputable risk, to which we have to respond urgently, - the union commissioner bound it to him. 
The most important task the consumers' information and it the wide-ranging dissemination of informations is connected to this. 
The checking systems existing already that they should be allowed to work with suitable efficiency have to be reviewed by us in the light of the mentioned expert opinion and let them be able to keep pace with the newest technologies. 
Brussels asked the independent scientific commission, that onto the incidence of the portable music players, and in consideration of the increase of the number of the young persons exposed to the noise pollution caused by them, examines the problem. 
The researchers confirm that we have a reason for concern. European Commission is ready with the member states and the concerned parties collaborating though to examine, how potential measures the noise pollution to which rise was given by the portable players and similar devices would be allowed to introduce how dropped children and in the interest of juveniles' protection - the commission's member said it lastly. 
The an European safety regulation in validity defines the noise level which can be emitted by the portable music players maximally in 100 dB currently, concern growing however accompanies it onto the hearing impairment stemming from the overuse of the sound sorce with a character like this relevant data. 
Solutions like that exist at the same time, than pl. the reduction of the level of the noise pollution and his time span, through which the mentioned hearing impairments significantly can be forced back. 
EU's scientific commission explains that the portable one is a player at ones using an apparatus at them in his expert opinion, who weekly through five clocks with tall volume (more than 89 decibels) music is listened to, the noise pollution exceeds it onto the workplace noise relevant, currently maximum value in validity. 
There is the danger of the enduring hearing impairment after five years if somebody listens to music until longer time between similar circumstances. 
This portable one apparatus using approximately 5-10 affect his percentage, which 2, 5-10 million are in EU, may report a head. 
Rome, Alemanno set it up for the capital's future responsible commission 
Today is beginning, lasts until a March, the results in a June expected. 
Fővárosi Önkormányzat set this timetable Róma capital city future name onto a commission's function, that a morning assembled on his new seat which can be found behind Caracalla baths today. 
It to be come due course Antonio Marzano is effective in a month a president and the other 49 committee members draw up Rome's governing principles. 
The study and the plans are evaluated in the general meeting and the municipal commission following the March cue, that let it be possible to hand it in in a June the local government and Gianni Alemanno approved a metropolitan strategic plan officially by way of a Lord Mayor. 
This a totally independent commission, in which all kinds of political one, social and a cultural idea is represented - Alemanno emphasizes it - his task though, that let Rome draw up proposals like that his development ideas relevantly, onto which ones the political decision makers, so the general meeting and Önkormányzat Bizottság may lean. 
There is not a word from any kind of competence incompatibility, we would have liked only a platform like that, where Rome's good a maid, big plans may be born. 
In a March, the commission putrefies then because he made the decision after he did his work onto time a mandate is at disposal of a solo. 
We hand it in in a June Róma capital city future name strategic plan being based on a commission's work - made a statement to the Lord Mayor. 
Referring to it for those who judge the commission's function to be unnecessary, that the expert opinion set up by it does not manage obligatory strength, Alemanno answers in this manner: Everything depends on what kind of work the commission makes then, and that puts proposals with a what kind of standard down onto the table. 
If the standard proves to be suitable, just as well than in France in case of Attali Bizottság, what I take for granted in Rome's case, the contribution provided by it gets its share of an important role then. 
The strength of the politics often chips in the management of the daily cases, and it in the treatment of urgent cases arising from time to time. 
, Perspective viewpoints are watching taken into consideration farther opposite this, and onto a longer distance plan, and we work committed in the interest of Rome's development and his future. 
Rome's mayor wishes to lay down firmly that this is the commission cannot be considered for useless hydrocephalus, with what with completeness free, will not cost an Euro of the Roman citizens, serves as thought stimulation opposite this and the capital takes aim at the withdrawal of his most distinguished minds. 
There is need according to Alemanno onto an open-ended and elastic strategic skeleton program, what makes the jump in quality level that he would need so much possible for our city is uniform thinking about his future in a ghost. 
From the future in connection with which Rome's mayor emphasizes it: is not only restricted to the present municipal frameworks then, but with a lot farther considers, we not only see the prospective metropolis and the metropolitan status in him, but the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean:mediterranean area may play as his capital, and what he has to fill. 
Obama? It is first anti-American president. We show it why. 
A known, American politician avow himself independent one wrote about this in this manner: Peach Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
Jimmy Carter, who wrecked the American economy with his decisions, was the first, and enjoyed strong connections (as today makes it as a private person) with the hostile Islam. 
The attacks against Obama are thickening the way. 
Single Miami a lady wrote this on the internet: This the man's winter is with ambitions. 
Obama thinks that he may win the highest high public office of a nation like that on a cheeky manner, for which this was the senator of altogether two of his governors and five this far coffee! 
These attacks effectively meaningless; naturally racist character, but the voters do not give an answer his question, that a president will be good. The polls are here next: it is indicated that Obama will win, at that with considerable superiority. 
Who it is is in this case his emotions and does not listen to his reason. 
In the noon states' inside, a mississippi newspaper wrote this in his editorial: we know who the real American patriot casts his vote for in the voter cabin well. 
The side of the American mentality like that appears here, that was left hidden until the last moment. 
Speak only, we know what you want then, where we put the ex, Obamára or McCain re. 
Who swear on him are: United States are lost if Obama wins. 
Words like this were never over hitherto when the black candidate is his success quasi onto a commissioner purchasable. 
At the same time, despite reflecting on all this the democrats' winning weapon himself George Bush. 
You ask 1500 men about it, what were mistakes committed under Bush's office hours? 89 percentages it responded, that Iraq. 
America changes. 
This nation lost 50.000 soldiers in Vietnám, and they made it tip into hells in such a way that he flew home. 
4500 soldiers perished in Iraq, and the Americans did not have to wrap it. 
The majority reckons that Iraq was Bush's weak point after all. 
An enormous task waits for the person who takes George W. place. 
USA: the journalists feel the economic collapse already, the time of the constraints came in the editorial offices. Many people blame the internet, because of the printed press's death. 
PEW a research institute asked five hundred American journalists as what they have an opinion in connection with the future situation of their trade and his intellectual power. 
Well, currently almost all journalists pessimistic his own future. 
It was not claimed however unambiguously that their concern would have decreased in the look of authenticity. 
So much isolated is not felt, than early. 
The money is the American journalists' problem. 
The 2008 crisis is a weak economic model's bankruptcy according to them. 
An additional serious trouble is reported the newsroomra, that is the constraints inflicted upon the editorial offices preparing the newspaper. 
If we do not want it, that the traditional journalism, in the sense that the wide publicity understands by this, onto minimal one let him shrink, it is necessary to solve this problem - the asked journalists say it. 
Complex pessimism about which right can be been nowadays characterize the American journalism. 
Sixty of the percentages of the journalists working in the printed press and top managers is keeping up with from that direction, that the national journalism is due on bad road. 
The journalists' 65 percentages are in a top manager position on a local level. 
A counter electronic press printed. 
Does not cause difficulty for the press's colleagues in order to be seen, where the web progresses. 
The largest publishers push their way for themselves towards the internet, of which many people think it in such a way that the printed press is his killer,. 
The economic pressure perceived by the journalists grew to 79 percentages. 
The 500 asked journalists admitted that he puts his vote down beside the technology, in that hope, that it is good for the journalism possibly. 
Today in the American press trade abyss gapes the editorial leaders, that is the headmasters, and between the correspondents working for them. 
On a national level 56 of the leaders' percentages sure in him, that their correspondents share their informations with others, while this proportion is only 23 on a local level onto a percentage can be done. 
Some people connect this with the safe workplace. 
47 of the leaders' percentages are afraid that he may lose his workplace inside three years on a national level. 
This proportion is 30 percentage in case of the journalists. 
In America the question of the safe work on a team level (in our editors' case, szerk.) is on an agenda continuously. 
A contract is at disposal of only 13 of the journalists' percentages. 
In case of a so huge nation, than United States with 300 million residents, where more thousand are newspaper, journals, radios, telly and an Internet provider works, the employers offer as much as are wanted generally, the thing is needed in this manner or is not needed on a basis works. 
The headmasters receive tall payment generally, the editors though ten thousand a dollar may be earned monthly, the pension and in addition to the payment of a hygienic insurance premium. 
The freedom works on a quite complicated principle on the other hand: in the first year x day, in the third likewise, while the maximum one does not attain it after a certain time 15 days. 
But the American journalists, their own acknowledgement, they get sick often in the course of the year. 
Everything is the function of the climate. 
UNIPOL: RÓMAI BÍRÓSÁG: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD 
Carmelo Rinaudo, Római Bíróság the president of the division of second punisher rejected the application of Danilo Coppola being active in a real estate trade, who his residence, Grottaferratából would have liked to go over into a Roman flat. 
Investigation, Unipol is underway against Coppola because of an economic bankruptcy - BNL is related to a share exchange in the framework of an examination proceeding about the case of an agreement. 
The house arrest was resolved on the last week, the row of the procedure initiated against it, and it Grottaferratára it was changed to a residence leaving prohibition relevantly. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, it was requested that the real estate specialist should be allowed to go over from the rural small town his metropolitan flat. 
According to the court but these commutings (onto which the prosecutor made a dismissive proposal relevantly) it would be made possible, that the company influences his cases and let him get at the evidences brought up against it. 
In danger the elite 
The phenomenon was sensible before with some days already, when the chamber of deputies did not vote for the 700 billion dollar rescue equipments submitted by the White House: interested the Americans' considerable part better, and interests it yet always, the punishment of Wall Street, than the rescue of the economy. 
Yesterday's New York Times support this, that from that direction informs, that breaking because of the present crisis took shape inside GOP, which shows an increasingly bigger rift, the legatee, moderate, east coast attitude supporting the federal institutions and business circles and the middle and in noon states continually strengthening, Washington and financial világ-ellenes between a new guideline. 
This guideline expressed itself on a critical manner in the course of the chamber of deputies vote mentioned in the introduction. 
The above event but only one for those considerable changes, that the economic restructuring going on even now foretells or to display gives, and not only in United States, but in all of the western world, indeed possibly it without. 
Is disappearing in that manner, that the crisis, in USA and Europe, speeds them up only the already his good time latent phenomena, which are consolidated in this new atmosphere,, and they are revealed finally. 
The first phenomenon like this it updating, the reconveyance of the double category of the state sovereignty into the public consciousness, in connection with the uniform renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis affects the bank-financial institutions that cultivate their links with the foreign countries though, after all primarily, and in a quite wide circle, peoples like that and families are swept along with themselves, that in one single country, they live in a state. 
This means direct political difficulty to the ones on the government on the other hand: what let them answer his difficulties and his protests. 
So the crisis appears worldwide though in an economic sense, though in a political sense quasi exclusively national. 
It seems that the political internationalism got sticked in his essence apart from a coastline: the eloquent testimony of this European Union, which is the different one, interests and is not able to assign a uniform political trend manoeuvring between national strategies being different. 
Everybody expects the intervention, the rescue equipment of the single national governments next in this manner, onto the new one upswing and the new rules, but chiefly the opening of the funds: since economic sources, a so financial supply, which may be capable, are at the single states' disposal only in a tight squeeze onto him, that let him put the things in order. 
Their devices and their authority are found in that direction, how these are used: a source with two inestimable values like that, with which somebody else is any kind presumably, is at disposal of given circumstances on his case market and one single international organization will never take action in a measure like this. 
There is a new emphasis laid by the crisis on the national state otherwise in full harmony with that fact, that happened recently an economic increase ascribes increasingly bigger significance to a factor like that, that is linked to this element tightly: this though the territoriality. 
On a paradoxical manner since, while we were keeping up with from him, that we joined the network's, the increasingly more subtle technology's abstract world already, and we were keeping up with from that direction, that the global financial world in that direction ordered, that dominates the world, we had to notice that our future depends on things not cut little like that rather continually only once, than the water, the crop and the crude oil. 
Because of things that it is possible to transport though from one of the halves of the planet into the other one, after all in a full measure to a delimited place, an area can be bound. 
In this manner next much more trumps are at who dominates the area disposal, who was born for his misfortune on a place where there is not crop is not crude oil and there is not water. 
I would switch to the second novelty, which foreshadows a uniform fault line, with this. 
Who declares it, that area, state, government, it says it necessarily: politics, being up an other word. 
From this viewpoint it seems that the economic crisis produces two phenomena being in tune with each other: 
On the one hand its objective recognition, that onto authentic leadership there is need, onto some such person, who can take the events in a hand,. 
The present leadership, particularly one brings the economic leaders' full losses of credit on the other hand on the other hand, who proved to be totally inappropriate and it was proven, that a lot yet before them the obscure area. 
The two have even deeper significance together and in a certain sense more alarming: the losses of credit, the feeling of impatience, unfitness and segregation, that increasingly more affect the full managerial elite in a western country. 
Is disappearing in that manner so, that the conviction that it is his social élite time on a peak this far expands in the population's increasingly wider circle expired. Expired, yet before their acts, their experiences, their lifestyle, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, it would have been made their own. The social elite becomes alienated from the majority's opinion increasingly better with this. 
In brief the claim for the leadership, a complex but strong delegitimációs nourishes a movement with the ruling class in a covert form and opposite the traditional political system. This in the voters' turmoils not waited for, you are recently in the sudden changes of the public feeling expresses himself. So for example the conservatives' advent to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the labour party unit in Great Britain, you are the American congressional representatives' rebellion against Bush (and possibly the Italian right's victory here can be enumerated). 
It seems that the legatee is élite, his parties, his programs, indeed we could say it, that his customs, takes it less with his press and together with his renowned intelligentsia, continually, can represent what is a time of his in the western society's deeper layers less continually because of this just happens. Furthermore, the economic crisis gets stronger continually, expands and is able to give rise to increasingly more excessive impulses potentially. 
Talking about the masses' rebellion being imminent despite all these would be exaggerating sounding sincerely. 
But to entail an open eye altogether does not do harm. 
We may entail Super strength adhesive on the wall 
To overcome the gravitation with the help of a Super strength adhesive and to be due on the wall than Spiderman. 
This aim more American research centres pinned it up in front of himself, and a group formed by four institutions is near the solution. 
An the researchers succeeded with altogether 2,5 square centimetre adhesive pieces an to stick 100 kilogram bodies to a vertical wall and to be there. 
The study - A Science title an American journal published it the daytoni university, Akron, Georgia Institute of the discoveries of some researchers of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The substance invented by the scholar group already early existing, special, ú n. coal was born from continuing to improve substances with a nanopipe construction. 
We have to imagine the operation principle of the adhesive in that manner, than a packet is similar to spaghetti piping - Zhong Lin Wang says it Atlanta Georgia Institute of Technology researcher. 
The researchers drew the idea, which provides perfect adhesion for the animal, from the foot of the stellion covered with microscopic wrinkles. 
With the different substances, than tests made with glass, with Teflon one and with abrasive paper for example proved that the new adhesive is ten times more efficient, than the sole of the mentioned reptiles, detaches from the wall easily at the same time - Liming Dai explains it, the daytoni university engineering karának his researcher. 
TO BE DUE ON A WALL? - This substance may be useful as temporary adhesive - Liming Dai adds it to him. 
We may have been on the wall, dot some than Spiderman? Possibly yes, but the researchers are thinking in a less fascinating use like that rather, than the linking of the electronic apparatus, because the coal nanopipes guide the heat and the electric current well. 
It may hit an additional application on the area of space research yet. 
The superheroes may be waiting yet. 
MÁSIK KUTATÁS - California Berkeley Egyetem makes experiments with a new mucilage. 
American Chemical Society c. the California one appeared in a journal according to an article scholars a hair-like one like that, mikroprepared from a thread substance adhesive, which goes through a self-purification in the course of being superficial, was presented, insures perfect adhesion always in this manner. 
Medicines? With juice prohibited! 
To guard the grapefruit is needed-, orange and with apple juice. 
These the tall one containing vitamins, primarily in summer popular slaking beverages, in as much they get into the organization together with certain life-saving medicines, they modify his absorption, because of a case függően you are strengthened reducing them exerting an influence by this. This may have serious hygienic consequences. 
The canned one you are fresh juices and certain medicine for a band's application his risks David Bailey, London University of Western Ontario professor called it the attention. The professor announced it on ongoing American Chemical Society 236. national meeting in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit-, an orange or apple juice are able to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, preventing their salutary effect with this and plunging his ill health into danger. 
The grapefruit juice got onto his prisoner have dock when it turned out that some antibiotics are capable early already, anti-histamine, being worried reducing, to enhance the effect of a pacemaker and nerve medicine until a level which can be considered toxic one. 
Risky medicines - Olasz Gyógyszerészeti Intézet himself made the news public in his official gazette before with two years, and warned the doctors and patients in one in order to be taken seriously it együttfogyasztással mentioned related risks, and what is drunk at the time of the income of medicines like that in order for them to listen, than you are Diazepam for example the methadone. 
Not CSAK A GRAPEFRUIT - according to the researchers, the orange and the apple juice implies substances like that, which ones the efficiency of the medicines is hampered by them. 
The agents would be allowed to enumerate their list long, which ones the grapefruit and the other juices hinder his absorption. 
Michele Carruba, the professor of Milan Állam Egyetem pharmaceutical department call the attention for this: The different national and international pharmaceutical institutes signal the discoveries with a character like this promptly generally towards it, who, in as much necessary, they ensure that it should be modified on the guide of the given implement character data. 
It is necessary to read it because of this always the to take planned the guide of medicine, and let us not let it influence our seed if something is not understandable, but we ask our medical attendant or our chemist unambiguously - Ansa emphasized it an institute's specialist. 
Paul Krugman got economic Nobel-díj 
American Paul Krugman got economic Nobel-díj, the commercial models and the economic activity for the analysis of his regional contexts. 
The 55 year neokeynesiánus Krugman, Princeton teach at a university, and his known publicist for New York Times. 
Krugman Bush one of the most fervid reviewers of a government's economic and foreign affairs measures. 
After the 2001. September terrorist attack with some months, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman forecast it in his editorial published in New York Times, that the latter event has more crucial consequences then looking at the history of United States yet, than the collapse of the twin towers. 
This forecast did not arouse few debates, the economist was reproached with it in more flavours, but we know that he was accurate already today. 
I am surprised, and shocked a small one, how the public interest exceeded Enron's or Worldcom scandalous collapse how quickly - said it on 2002 of Krugman ends. 
The member of Európai Központi Bank executor commission according to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Krugman an immense valuable economist, Bush spreads a government's excessive criticisms expressed against his liberalism in a quite aggressive style at the same time. 
Microsoft lived to see delivering up Open Office, the third ellenes" packet 
OpenOffice.org appears today application packet with open program code increasing 3.0 personal productivities, that Microsoft Office has increasingly wider layers in his sight as his free alternative, from the home one to the office users, from freelance ones until the public administration equally. 
Following the work made by the voluntary developers watched over by SUN Microsystem through almost a year, new Open Office steps with more novelties in front of the general public: apart from the welcoming screen and the rethought, less Spartan:spartan application surface, offers more essential novelties. So for example Apple Mac OS X with an operative system truth compatibility, and the new one favours it, ODF according to an ISO standard (Open Document Format) 1.2 formats. 
Emphasized attention consecrated Office with 2007 systems truth for compatibility, Open Office can open it in this manner Microsoft with new extension documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting yet the specific function of some modules, than for example the one that makes reducing PowerPoint for the size of shows possible. This truth may be useful on the road of an e-mail in case of file sending. An other function PDF files into a graphic module favours the importation of truth, with the keeping of the side place arrangement. 
Though on this surface hybrid PDF we may create documents, that typical Adobe unites it format the spreadsheet you are with word processor elements. 
Sharing went through a number development inside the applications: the spreadsheet favours the common usage of the workbooks, but each other prevent the overwrite of his works. The remark of all colleagues is labeled with a different colour, which helps the easier recognizability in the check section,. 
Some firms work on it already, that some functions of OpenOffice from internet let him be available (on the cloud, on the cloud), in this manner it to be come due course the definitive variant may be presented presumably in weeks. 
The Italian version, after the mirror was put beside English which can be found already since a Friday on sides, from the undermentioned title can be downloaded: http://it.openoffice.org/Download/3.0.0/download300.html 
The software package usual Windows and Mac OS apart from operative systems Linux-brings for stands for a provision. 
Onto a request even our home, you are on our workplace we may take over installation CD. 
The gratuitousness means the largest attractiveness presumably in terms of the spreading of the home application, but Open Office software package now tries the business sector to get one's chance, since he may count on several administrative and school projects. 
They are not missing for the little one and medium-size enterprises ideal educational one, counseling and szervízszolgáltatások neither, what may open new business perspectives. 
Open Office consists of five fundamental modules: Writer, the word processor suiting Word; the table handler taking aim at the substitution of Calc, the Excel; Impress, Powerpoint character to presentations; Dbase the best-known one, Access are similar to a database handler; and finally Draw the graphical module. 
The 2008 aim is the achievement of the 5 million downloads. Though this mouth of mine will be taller at the expected one presumably if we consider that we are at 3.600.000 already with the appearance of the new version. 
Kohl result positive, this already the fourth drug-taking case

IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES PUTS A KÉRDÉS, OLASZORSZÁG RASSZISTA UP? 
Italy from emigrants' country was transformed into one of the popular targets of the immigrants received hesitantly recently only. 
Belpaese is transformed because of this racist nation? New York Times harp on this question, that young Burkina Faso-i setting out from Abdul William Guibre case - who was murdered in the past month in Milan, because he stole a box of biscuit - finds a long article for the debate around the racism going on in Italy. 
The case characterize what New York Times call the paradox of north well: in the northern regions the strongest one the integration and the highest one the employment at the same time the the immigrant opposition and Északi Liga support " too here the strongest one in the country. 
Onto the Italians' and the cumulative tenseness's between the immigrants support NYT quotes it in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampinoban and Castel Volturnoban happened cases. 
Indeed. 
The new laws demanded by the league, which would put the rein on tighter one in connection with the immigration,, and the illegal immigrants' expulsion, the change of mood happening in Italy would be facilitated as his example they came up. 
The pope and the president of the republic emphasize the mentioned tendency: Giorgio Napolitano XVI. met Benedek in the Quirinale palace, and suggested that it is a state and the church let them work together in the interest of the defeat of the racism. 
The students suffer from getting more expensive rent monies, a room may cost 900 euros even 
The crisis does not affect the market of the accomodations issued to the undergraduates. 
A student may pay 900 euros for a single room in Milan even according to Sunia, the freshest survey of Lakásbérlők Szakszervezet, 700 in Firenze, 650 in a Naples and 600 in Rome. 
The phenomenon put on so astonishing sizes already by today, that - because of the considerable total costs falling to the families - locks away students' wide layers from the opportunity of the learning - Laura explains it The leader of Sunia study office is Marian. In these cities from the students' part supported tall demand deformed the market in a measure like that, that a general rise in prices process started up opposite the local residents. 
The real estate offers imply a row of irregularity in the majority of the cases: unregistered, contracts not implying a rental prize limitation, with connected underlease. 
According to Sunia onto an extraordinary measure like that there would be need, which makes an opportunity for the maximisation of the prices through the review of the taxational system,. 
The details of the survey show that 450 euros are asked for a bed in Milan, on Brianza neighbourhood; the price of the one-man room because of 650 euros (Bande Nere neighbourhood) averagely until 800 euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) expands, but may attain the 900 euros (Vittoria neighbourhood). 
In Firenze a bed place an average costs 350/400 euros, a room into approximately 700. 
In a Bologna, a bed place costs 250/280 euros where the students' bulk lives in a neighbourhood close to the university, if double-bed, and into 370-500 euros, if from single room there is a word. 
In Rome close to the central universities on areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 euros are asked an one-man one and 450 for a bed in a for two room. 
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros an one-man room) the prices on the neighbourhood of the rest of the universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
It is possible to save some in the suburban circumferences: a bed costs 300 euros and into 450 a single room Prenestina, Centocelle and in other similar circumferences. 
300/450 euros are asked for a bed place in a Naples, for a room until 400 600 euros. The price position is the highest one on Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei neighbourhood. 
It is necessary to pay 250/350 euros for a bed place in a lambkin, and at least 350 for a single room. 
In the smaller cities the prices in an absolute value though lower, but bigger weight is represented inside the urban budget. 
In the cities like that, than for example Perugia, where students are looking accomodation, an other abnormality often apart from EU can be experienced: the rent money asked of the foreign country students with approximately 25-30 percentages taller, than in the Italian tenants' case. 
Viszlát good old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema halls was over in the cities 
Traditional cinemas close in favour of the multiplex. 
A city, where there are not cinemas, a blind city, like that than a face without eyes. 
Giuseppe Tornatore pictures prepared by a director present all that, which it is in Italian cities, effectively, but happens in the rural regions. 
The cinemas' displacement - in the suburbs the big, multi-roomed cinemas' appearance, then as a result of this in the city centres can be found one hall him wasting away - process seeming one of which clear cannot be kept and one which cannot be turned back, but bears all of the features of a real cultural crime at the same time. 
When historical and full places disappear with memories, the one like that, as if a friend of ours would go away, an acquaintance with who we shared our road and several experiences - Cinema Paradiso director says it. The film, which twenty are with a year before, Oscar, and the Cannes-i means the grand prize of a festival to that of a gymnastics thorax, a provincial cinema tells his lyric story, the yearning, after a cinema experience that got lost for ever possibly. 
The operators' largest association, the data announced by Anec speak clearly: the latter one 316 traditional cinemas closed in five years. The cinemas in the cities may have booked the largest loss: 10 cinemas closed in Firenze, 9 Milans, a Naples, a Bologna and Rome, 6 Torino, and in 5 Palermo. 
From among the regions affected mostly is due on an edge Emilia-Romagna, that 82 one lost a hall cinema, then Toszkána (44) and Lombardia (41) comes next. 
And that their disappearance just the multiplex spreading the responsible what does not prove it better, since the highest one is a dot in these three regions of Italy it multi-roomed cinemas' number opened newly: the latter one the number of the halls rose by 195 in Lombardia in five years, with 81 Toszkánában and with this much Emilia-Romagnában. 
The number of the Italy units grew on an irrational manner - Anec president says it Paolo Protti. Is properly, that we build up new establishments, but the it would be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones already, because everything is not willing one going there when a urban cinema closes to turn into the multiplex. 
Not talking about the financial main reason not charged intended as the operators' support: the state his debt went regularly down to approximately 10 million euros can be done. 
From an ethic and moral viewpoint shameful, that the government does not observe the measures in the validity. 
To the market's maintenance yearly onto 16-18 million euros there would be need. 
A Bologna case deserves separate attention. This first so Italian city, which decided on his concern above the closures in that manner,, that the kül- and downtown one hall cinemas the interest of his protection and his promoting, the local government and it remedies the problem through an agreement between Anec. 
The tax reliefs provided for the operators would be included in the provisions, and the benefits provided for the audience onto the promotion of the accessibility: the spectators may drive up into the limited zones and they may park with a preferential tariff in certain car parks. 
Likes this initiation - Giuseppe Tornatore says it - and I hope for it, that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, but a Bologna example will be observed. 
Though it sure, that for the traditional cinemas, it that let the fight be able to be taken up against the multiplex rule, to repair the sound is needed and on picture quality, because the today's audience is much more demanding. 
The traditional cinema's protection was an important question always for me: Supercinema closure Bagheriában - where the child and I spent my youth - gave that spark, because of what I made it finally Cinema Paradiso-t, although 10 are his years already I meditated on him. 
25 I live eaten in Rome, in this manner when the via Nazionalén I go past locked Rialto or Quirinale, how I shall not see it from the dust turned black placards, I turn it away rather my head. I experienced so many experiences here 
Tight threads between the politics and the ndrangheta, Gioia Tauro mayor was arrested 
Gioia Tauro mayor favoured the Piromalli clan's interests the municipal decisions. 
Serious charges were formulated the calabriai an anti-maffia directorate's judges Gioia Tauro mayor and his deputy mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno mayor Carlo against Martell one, who were arrested in the morning in a conspiracy today truth with the charge of exterior participation. 
Handcuff avoided senior mediator between Gioacchino Piromalli, the clan and the public administration, and with the chief with an identical name, lawyer onto a nephew's hand, who was condemned in a mafia-like conspiracy already early truth because of participation, and 10 million euros of compensation was imposed on him. 
The disdain of an all kinds of legal and ethical rule, we more that of the good taste, the public prosecutors write it. The two local local governments it proclaimed his intention, that Piromalli would pay advisory fee to a lawyer. 
The clan would have had ingress officially in this manner onto the city hall, which would have provided an additional opportunity for the public administration's check, and his management, that already otherwise for considerable one can be said. 
Agazio Loiero, the calabriai the president of a region's general meeting does not conceal that there is number collusion in the region the local institutions and between the organized underworld: There are areas like that where the mafia's spreading is stronger, than somewhere else, where the collusion is inescapable almost. 
A number local politician resists the pressure of the ndrangheta however, they the heroes who are clear they are left over. 
The today morning arrests the continuations of the July events, how managed to behead the Piromalli clan when the police announced it. 
April the local politicians were acquitted of their commission concerning the local government's administration on an end. Gioia Tauro municipal commission was dissolved already once in 1991, then the supposed one between the organized crime and the local local government because of intertwining. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian-Democratic mayor reigning at the time of the dispersion, the 2006 one the right centre got to a coalition's edge in second turning. 
He shouted a scandal when the county hall ordered the municipal commission's dispersion. 
The then home secretary had it summoned before a court substitute Marco Minninit, and acuse it of having mapped everything out with a political purpose. The court expounded it in the arrest warrant signed in the morning today though, that the Piromalli clan so far ventured, that it A3 let a project require his alteration. 
Dal Torrionével emerges from interception ordered in an eye - the public prosecutors write it - that an extensive one was willing, to satisfy Piromalli undertaking claims representing a group standing near generally known to a family, to subordinate the local government's decisions to the clan interest. 
The energy comes from the waves, and the big ones come now 
An inexhaustible power source, which exposes 70 of his percentages to the surface of the planet,, and what the big international energy firms discover now only yet 
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy source, on which giants like that cast an eye,, than Chevron, who try to place their hand upon it now. 
Already a hundred the opportunity of as what it would be possible to gain energy from the motions of the sea is researched eating. The researches intensified in the 70 years, on the time of the first oil crisis. 
Around 1980, the idea of the utilisation of the sea energy was put aside when the price of the crude oil decreased, but the re-elevation of the section provides new impetus to the price of claims supported by the environment protection today and the crude oil. 
London World Energy Council (WEC) his 2007 estimate the world it would be possible to cover 15 of the percentages of the need of electric current with the establishments utilizing the waving of the seas. 
This quantity is the double of what the atomic plants manufacture currently. 
The currents and the tide would be there yet in addition to this. 
In impetus the giants. 
Enersis was the first firm, which pledged itself beside the sea energy,, and signed an agreement in single north Portugal in 2005 from a power station to be established. 
He seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was announced. 
Two years passed since it, and increasingly more firms vote for the sea energy, between them people who were the committed supporters of the traditional energy this far. 
Chevron studies the technologies utilizing the energy of the oceans, and considers the opportunity of collaborating with us - the spokesman of one of the American oil industry giant's associated undertakings declared it, Wall Street Journal for an economic daily. 
The questionable cooperation is necessary to the starting of the Alaskan project being aimed at the utilisation of the sea energy published by the American energy commission a permit concerns his acquisition. 
The thing not with little significance, mainly if we consider that USA continues crude oil exploitation in Alaska just, indeed Bush a president started an additional plan concerning drilling recently. 
Apart from Chevron New York Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey-i Ocean Power follows the way of the energy which can be obtained from the sea. It invested till now sums, already as much knowing about the details may be him, they give evidence of growing interest. 
The technology waits for development. 
According to the experts temporarily yet from crude technology there is a word, already only because of that, because the energy which can be gained from the sea does not dispel it with the environmental effect related doubts. 
The currently existing, to the Portugal one or the one of Scotland similar establishments all small sized, a too big problem is not caused in the look of the ecosystem because of this. 
It on the other hand, that let it be possible to produce energy in bigger scale, onto establishments like that there is need, that his environmental effect more considerable. 
A diverse opportunity exists: Ocean Power uses a buoy system connected to each other for example. 
Hatched by way of the waves and the buoys up and down motive shoves the pistons placed in them and cylinders turn it into a hydraulic pressure. 
The pressure turns a turbine, that though a generator nourishes. 
The electric current is left on the cables extending under the sea onto the mainland. 
Onto equal one there are four establishments with a similar character in a planning section, which ones they wait for the federal permit only already. They would make use of a part of the produced energy in a military establishment. 
Verdant Power on the other hand the New York one East River six tengeralatti placed in a strait started the power generation already with the help of a turbine an for a shopping centre and a car park. 
The motion of the water turns the shovels of the turbines round at the time of a tide, and this whirl motion nourishes it the generator. 
Verdant declared that he has a long list from those partners, who the energy is necessary to his use only they wait for permits. 
After waves tide. 
The opportunities which can be exploited through the tide deserve marked attention currently. 
Although from a periodical phenomenon there are a word, the tide more foreseeable, than the wind, the day, or the waves, because of this for a more reliable power source can be considered. 
New York, Maine and Alaska, and the rest of the coastal states 7, 5 awakened a million dollars in 2008, just by way of the tide provided onto the exploitation of energy. This sum grows to 35 million foreseeably in 2009.
