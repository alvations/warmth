The lack of snow in mountain bothers hoteliers
The deserted trails issue to lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
As such, it is still possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our website.
Internet users roam the offers, ask the price but dare not commit to set aside for the moment.
And if they call us, they are asking for at the outset be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl information portal." "Info."
If you want to spend New Year's Eve of his dreams ?pindler?v Mlýn, it is better not too reluctant to book.
If we give priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation is only then, then we can try to wait a few days.
Hoteliers of ?pindler simply for the moment that stays of a week for the New Year.
I think they will still try a time to place them, but they assign them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura."
The agency of Ingtours tourism Vrchlabí also proposes still beds for all winter periods of free.
The week of Christmas we are most concerned for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It remains for free, say, half of the chambers in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few visits Christmas last minute cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert."
The Vrchlabí of tourism agency may also propose New Year's Krkono?e, but there are fewer seats.
The 14 days of February go equally well, the remaining winter stays are moderately.
This year, the interest in the winter stay was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkono?e.
People expect it to get to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in snowless mountains.
If the tracks are during the week, Christmas will be complete, "think Schiefert."
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec Sn??kou pod is slightly higher than the last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the vacation of Polish January and February sells well also, "advises Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec."
The hotel Omnia near the central parking of Jánské Lázn? is also complete to 80% during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the latest Lázn? of Jánské hotel.
This year, we have been pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already 60% occupancy at the moment.
February is somewhat lower for the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkono?e will certainly indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel Krkono?e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday he will be cooler and if there is rain, they should be snowy mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm, informed Jakubský station in Hradec Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the painstaking effort with which Barack Obama, Chairman of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which it considered itself simple.
When he ended up leaving sweat doctrine devoutly expected, it turned out that it be recopied carbon paper since the Iraq scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to be used in the same text several times "like Iraq", he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as title of his own speech: "a new way forward"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the strategy of Bush, who came from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and capable of success at this point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, he left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
New commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, the general McCristal Stanley, who has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in spite of the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has been wavering for three months but for lack of a better option, he at least defrauded the general of 10,000 troops.
He has managed to eradicate the promise of 5,000 more on the part of Europe, even if there were 10,000 originally.
This brings the addition of problems in the entire strategy for Obama seems its intention to withdraw the army within 18 months of Afghanistan and to complete the process within three years. the doctrine of Obama brings more questions than answers there is.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
In spite of fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change their leader from day to day on what suits them.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will only to splash behind which proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity with regard to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick to act", which is the basic aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy he was perplexed by his proactive approach.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war in view of their "prompt return home" will bring here a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will consider the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last summit of NATO has shown that the will of Europeans to take part in military operations in Afghanistan is moving toward the negative.
The EU cannot do not want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that enhanced sanctions do not affect Iran's, the US will find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will unfortunately result a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore remains quite in time for the board on a new strategy, if it would be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive a bonus in cash
Senior leaders employees of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive this year of cash.
The company announced to respond to criticism about its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they may not resell before five years.
The actions can be taken out to the leaders if they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs raises questions as to lead in the effort to link the rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense that must be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan society
The concern lies in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after having set aside nearly $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of the premiums will likely surpass 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had to assign a single fee of 50% bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
Women have achieved this year of the Nobel Prize in all areas except physics
Five women, a record number, which received today in Stockholm of the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustav the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German Romanian writer Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the US Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, the US Elinor Ostrom with his countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been a winner this year was the physical.
The award was presented today to the scientific Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital photo equipment, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reached 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to the US president Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award because it is only at the beginning of its path and that it is also the head of a country engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy he added that the war is essential in certain situations to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota intends to resign Klaus called Chateau
President Vaclav Klaus will receive Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the budget of the state for the next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota office will be in the agenda of their appointment for Friday.
Klaus critical budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, thereby exacerbating the crisis in public finances.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion kronor that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies confirmed Wednesday suggestions for transfers of money from the left and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats the fact that they would increase in an indirect way the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left hand, the government, Klaus and the right disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer that had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by the deputies, abolishes the package of measures for savings spent by the government of Fischer and should he stop the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the Law on the budget of the state, but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irréfrénable disability" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, not of favourable solution.
Only a government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a broader consensus than political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Topolánek indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should jeopardise its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nešas said? TK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens does clearly more.
In its response, Prime Minister Fischer has described as a "drastic verdicts" of these words.
The head of the ČSSD Jiri Paroubek reacted against Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering, and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD called of success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
In spite of criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American players, South Africans say that the new film in Hollywood Invictus Invaincu will expose a lot of things in the world on the country, its struggles and its victories.
The history of sport, of relations between races and of Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged 91 who asked her to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I said: "if I have to embody, I should be able to see you personally."
The actor aged 72 was rewarded with a prize for his role in the tragedy Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of, for example, boxing has embodied the leader of a movement against slavery now known as slave, a fictional US president, even in the film Almighty God Evan but never someone alive and so important for so many people that Mandela's.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the team of rugby Francois to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected knows that his country resteencore and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
It is persuaded to unite his people through sport and decided to join the Rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked several years to get the story of Nelson Mandela on large screens.
I had no other purpose if play this role in order to bring the most of the reality, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was safe to talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind-the-scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands.
I realized that when I shakes hands, I recovers from your energy, it passes and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Francois Pienaar, captain of the national team for rugby in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I was opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have much more air in the film. "
Despite the differences between the real actors and models, Invictus under the leadership of the director Eastwood received positive notices and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized its discretion in these words: "this is a very good story, a very well done film."
In the assessment of films on the site rottentomatoes .com, Invictus received 76% positive feedback.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russian tested a rocket
There has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The defence ministry acknowledged that yesterday to have tested a rocket an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has yet been a failure and a missile "Bulava" that was originally going to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its presence in repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava not flew, and it is damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile that doesn't"
A missile that doesn't but shining
The 13th test took place early normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was new damage to equipment.
This is clearly the driver of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" went up in the nuclear submarine hoc Donskij sailing under the surface of the Sea Blanche.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by a flying object not identified exactly likely was by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegian not doubted a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage has affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced malfunctions on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Department of Defense believes that only six out of 13 were failures.
The rate of success of nearly 50% fills therefore general optimism and therefore maintain that a day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclear hypersonic nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA 51 years Moscow
The legendary champion Viatcheslav Fetissov will arise again in a professional game in 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will assist his team of CSKA Moscow in need and make its entry probablementdéjà during the match on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, which ended his career to 40 years in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov train regularly and agreed to help the team.
We must still resolve some details on the form, says the coach of the Nyemtchinov Sergey club, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been clarified whether the very legendary hockey player will cover only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a full season in Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov, Kassatonov quintet - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the greatest of success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union it has won twice at the Olympic Games, seven titles of world champion, he triumphed in the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he was the tributes also NHL twice held the Stanley Cup.
He is a member since 2001 Hall of Fame hockey.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and supersedes all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai of No?ovice agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions have declared a state of emergency Monday strike.
The spokesman Petr Van?k of the Hyundai confirmed.
Management is still agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that's why voluntary overtime were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, "said Van?k.
The site Sedmi?ka indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech koruna employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be allocated afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, as Van?k, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they are receiving the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their holiday and year-end aindiqué Van?k.
In addition to that all employees present Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their breakfast.
In view of the fact that the extra hours were the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have ceased production last week, spontaneous management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, "said Van?k.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two additional hours in addition to their eight hours.
Unions have cancelled the status of strike after signing of the agreement.
The next negotiations between the management of the automotive plant and the unions must be held Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kucha? said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike in the event of agreement on their claims and of signature of a common document.
The situation in the plant peaked on Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on strike spontaneously because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor conditions of salary and of alleged hazing.
Management has defended with the fact that employees must work in supplement to fulfil the requirements of auto production.
In the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions have also requested that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
Unions asked the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
Furthermore, they want this year a reward of 5,000 kroner (209? about) for them.
The automotive Hyundai of No?ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
Last year it began production in series in November.
She made about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "hard-working people"
A team of Czech and German scientists used to test new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not so intensely on the current variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
We can dramatically extend the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, involves a series of side effects.
Over the repression of this proliferation for the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The experts' work of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V?CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used so far, and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their understanding of the molecular mechanics of their routes on viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
Protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease inhibitor there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease inhibitor, it will also establish the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and in biochemistry from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically altered.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes as well as its resistant HIV, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, but it has not weakened on resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to look more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína ?ezá?ová, Director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and in biochemistry and of the institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. the ODS attacking Fischer, who has
The president of the ODS (Democratic Party Civic), Topolánek called "staggering" the ratification of the budget for the following year, he said, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should affect its existence.
The prime minister called the remarks of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nešas said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party did clearly.
According to Nešas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend parliamentary support for the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if he cares to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nešas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, although the proposals for amendments to EUR 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House has increased the money intended for wages of civil servants, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the social democrats was the fact that they increased in an indirect way the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the government's desire that a revised budget is a variant less bad than an interim budget.
Frustration and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nešas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his functions in case of ratification of the proposals for amendments, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the prime minister after its passage in government:
At the same time, he said that he wondered whether he would remain in office.
Its disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decided to continue to fight against the fiscal deficit, Nešas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who have imposed changes in the budget, do not belong in the government.
The Prime Minister should also say quite clearly that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those with health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Mr Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the Head of Government Fischer and of the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing of harmful, said in a press release Topolánek text from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nešas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of leading a fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House."
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of democrats.
I never thought and once it's on the agenda I want, "said since the House for journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected Government precisely by Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer departed in the afternoon for a debate in the European Council in Brussels.
ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nešas stressed in conjunction with the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow a vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphaned, there is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticism of the President of the Party in the House or in the country in the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I knew already when I abandoned my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of everything that there was a positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the fewer the trains on the same charges.
The Czech railways will eliminate or limit from December 13, some less responsible regional or express trains and will strengthen other instead.
The total coverage of transport will fall to the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two per cent from today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and reduced the tariff.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region which will have more routes to the capital, the railways will add a pendolino paddle.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less than fast trains on the line Prague - Písek non-profit-making organisations, the hotline Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
Regionally, the biggest drop in transportation concerns the region of Hradec Králové of eight per cent, by contrast Prague and its environs can rejoice for an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor non-profit-making organisations were cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek non-profit-making organisations will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes, we can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: for the time of Milovice residents must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is for the fifteenth line of commuter system, including the opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines into the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádra?í).
The D will introduce further lines HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains destined for ?umperk will leave by intervals of two hours.
Travelers will not take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year the bill for the regional railway: 200 additional millions of kronor.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transportation and will contribute to the railways in all four billion kroner next year to address the visible loss, the same amount as this year. the regional trains are controlled by the regions who will pay for them by a total eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in height of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 millions more expensive.
The railways newly signed a contract for ten years, up to now the term was always a year.
The railways appreciate the system, which explains that they have not resorted to an increase in prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only the one-day ticket Net and the Internet tickets discounted eLi?ka.
For passengers without a map of reduction, the price of Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of newly will depend on commuted eLi?ka, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region in the selection and was a single rate of 160 kronor.
Philippine rebels still retain more than 50 people, the children were released
The rebels abducted now 75 people in the southern Philippines, among which some students of a primary school and their teachers.
It is the AFP Agency informed, but who spoke to the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as a teacher.
The hostage-taking occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a flight in response to the police.
Local negotiators are trying now to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP Agency, the police first pursued the kidnappers following violence at a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the election of the administration of Governor avait30 journalists.
The governor of the province of southern Philippines was arrested in the wake of suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Ampatuan Andal, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
The Mindanao includes active Muslim separatists.
They have nevertheless renewed peace talks with the Philippine government Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman Mandela
The new Hollywood movie from Clint Eastwood arrives in the American rooms in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Nepora?ený), and narrae part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen decades ago by Nelson Mandela to embody.
The second male role of the legendary South African Rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in classrooms, the return of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
For its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside of Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains large expectations as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup of soccer, and secondly because the media are agitated by disturbing reports about the increase of racial conflict and of discrimination of the inhabitants of the share of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, rather for the moment in the new film are positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "pavanent" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of the role of long years, and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met personally with Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - to recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film personality and the message of Nelson Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns every individual has added.
Wearing the jersey of the national team for rugby
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin freely translated. in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave its establishment to the people depicted the South African defender of human rights during his tenure in the Chair.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to pick up two racial groups in a population long divided and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he dressed in the national jersey in the team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup that South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something of sacred, Mandela had been long championed mainly there are 14 years of white audience and has been recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the football championship will manage to unite the people again in a single nation, said the player in rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995, the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to see if the South African tense situation will improve.
South African whites are however sceptical as recently given in an interview for NL Christopher Dawson, fan of rugby who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
A processor worth tens of millions of kronor in flames in the area of Louny
A fire engulfed the morning a processor of society ?eps of distribution centre near the municipality of Vý?kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká? Marvan, spokesman of the Fire Ãstí, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They had originally let the processor burn, but they have revised their views and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special substance.
The cause is a technical failure, an internal short circuit of the processor.
No one was injured and according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandátova incident does not endanger the secure operation of the whole of transmission.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of kronor, the exact figure may be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed should be replaced by a new.
It adds that in ten years of operation, the company ?eps has not experienced a similar and that incidents of this kind are isolated.
The electrical supplies have not been interrupted, said the spokesman of the company šEZ for the Northern Bohemia Holingerova background Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, authorities and industries have not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A. s. ?eps is the sole operator on the Czech territory sets of transmission and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and expands 39 posts of distribution with 67 transformers transferring power from the sets of transportation to distribution sets and plots of lines of a length of 4,339 kilometres.
Jan?ura will complain for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Jan?ura Radim, owner of Student Agency, will now complain for defamation against three prefects social democrats.
And South Hašek against Michal concrete in the region of Moravia, Ratko Martínka of Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa?ík.
Jan?ura indicated in minut of Radio?urnál Dvacet.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of the company to operate regional railway in some regions.
All regions did eventually sign of long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three were attacked and say that there is fine mouths, whereas it only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways that is not true, because we know the price of Czech railways that were signed last week.
Therefore, we only have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jan?ura Radio?urnál.
Similarly, it reported evidence that no region has proceeded in agreement with the European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the filing of complaints of Mr Jan?ura represents the result of his media spectacle that acts as a free publicity for his company and his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do likewise.
I suppose that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Jan?ura gentleman who manipulates the public and resorts to false and inaccurate arguments about the regional rail transport, said Hašek
Jan?ura has already informed the last week that it will invest several millions of crowns in an advertisement that would mention the adverse regional approaches.
He said Radio?urnál that it will stop the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan?ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech railways operation of rail links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing tender.
According to Jan?ura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the region has even led to Jan?ura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we do not cease, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know of who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jan?ura today to Radio?urnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal diseases will be free and optional
Vaccination against the pneumococcal reversed the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Critics already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against the pneumococcal peak.
The pharmaceutical institute has already been defined for vaccines the maximum prices that will pay the insurance.
The experts see also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, the children born last year from August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal bacteria.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated its children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year the sickness spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care than unvaccinated children would require.
So far the state spends about 500,000 crowns per year for the vaccination of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcal bacteria are the cause but also of serious inflammation of the middle ear infections in which the brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there are until 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination reimbursed.
The vaccine be mandatory?
There are opinions on a potential liability of vaccine in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by the insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria.
At an international conference to which our association has participated, experts have not really been satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria.
We see it not for the moment, "said his spokesman Sr?e? Vlastimil.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Specialized HANA Cabrnochová, president of the Society of pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were immunized, you might consider a reduction of renewals of vaccinations "in a situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination voluntary" said, however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80% of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children that is funded by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should release funds for the prevention, conserving and potential future medical care.
Doctors will need to buy their own products
This is bound to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, concerning the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase the vaccine by insurance, doctors with the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amount of health insurance. "
Thus, physicians will need to buy the products and wait until the insurance reimburse.
According to estimates, pediatricians will individually invest close to 40,000 kronor per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, as Cabrnochová.
Always them and we
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger b at Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book by the author, "why the French dislike headscarves" (2006), an elegant and well-researched study on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book by Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious fabric.
Good anthropologist, he does not want to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France which now provide this with great eloquence. Bozen calls "Muslim areas" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well to listen and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interest to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, "he says, the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts from lawyers purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today, is a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
M Bowen believed that the values of Muslims and French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each side.
He wondered to what extent the French politicians (and the intellectual elite if virulent guardian of secularism) are genuinely committed to pluralism.
He said that Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism ", it detects a narrowness of key values."
Islam can be French? after reading of this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The world's darkest view
The Arctic is changing faster and in a more dramatic than any other place on earth.
Ice composed is dying at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and fishing sail new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of history and policies of complicated by whaling, it describes the long tradition of explorers of the Arctic who were their evidence in chasing the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous yearning for 14 years who had to fight that the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming along with their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show assembled 75 bears simultaneously.
Even today, the size of a zoo is typically a millionth of the area required to an adult prison. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because algae that grew in their thick fur.

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often performed on the threat posed by the hunting on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, Greenland and Canada killings continue where hunters by helicopter and Inuit Indians in motoski use fusilsd' powerful assault to hunt game.
Ironically, it is in the waters more than hunting north of these two nations that ice will remain longer.
In his new book, "after the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither nor oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late 19th and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the initial information on the melting of the polar ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped in the change of relief.
Surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened, camping out in the cold.
Mr Anderson looks the extraordinary world and tiny system depends on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water rushed in freezing.
But of the bear mentioned above the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"in a few months, this might be our turn"
The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class Angello Robinson, 19, made a trip for seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the tomb of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina in Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we are in danger of being in their place, "said Robinson on fallen soldiers.
If I arrived, I would like someone to do the same for me, this is why I just try to show compliance.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of the veterans in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way to organize the commemorations in honour of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester has also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (wreaths across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves in the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of Flight 93 of United Airlines Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the foundation Wal-Mart Foundation has given more de$150 000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, career soldier.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
All in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and of the Second World War, as well as of the Vietnam War, because they are not as frequently visited by the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while children were playing and couples holding hands, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, were silent on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the sour mood of the current wars filled the area.
People wept openly, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others looked to see the small black and white information cards, stuck in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and drove eight hours to gather on the tomb of the GunneryDavid Marine Sergeant Shane Spicer, combat death in July.
Nobody should ever forget thanks to which we are free... my son has paid for this, she said.
"long after I have disappeared, I want somebody us to remember him."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who was distributing mobile telephones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs US.
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the US Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of an arrest.
The anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba is an increasingly large community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes frequently on how husband and she followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez made several requests to leave the country to go rewards but authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration pursuing a soft approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States can promote reciprocity.
Mobile phones and portable computers are permitted to Cuba, although new and desired commodity in a country or the average salary of an employee is of $15,000 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are primarily used for text messages or a conversation in 15 minutes that corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few US in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "says Gloria Berbena, press officer of from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity which, in any other open society, would be authorized -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called" new Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, spent on trial and jailed the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries are beginning to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an alleged organizing a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would help to dismantle a large network of recruiters of terrorists scouring the Internet looking for young men radicalized.
Investigators said they hunted personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the YouTube website of video on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of Al Qaeda and of its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services which had been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the Al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As such, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far prohibited mountains of the Northeast become a haven of terrorism.
They were seen as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The authorities' representative said that the men were committed and that they are still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the camps of Al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the Pakistani forces of law.
The case of these five men -- remaining in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- stressed the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American secret services have priority to infiltrate men in the Al Qaeda network.
Recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those which may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits are studied nearly by Al Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and propagandaire of their value.
However Kohlmann Evan, expert of the Foundation NEFAs based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must be increasingly attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen request an "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets, here Saturday, calling for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Palais des Congres Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to estimates by the police.
This event went relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked militants saucepan, some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when fewer thing has happened during the discussions on the environment sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying There is not a planet B "and a Spanish, saying" the Earth said she has enough. "
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the birthplace of his mother, Peru, it opened the eyes on the divisive issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change that are already taking place. "
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the big march -- to get the word and to launch an appeal to the leaders of the world to make fair decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is not possible to avoid.
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who wore black masks and clothing, started several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few departments.
They launched near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, then followed by "some large explosions."
The Palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to monitor the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of the authorities key such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on the international discussions, he answered in English "in fact, this is something I had no idea."
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He noted that the march could appear harmful or helpful under the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they are harmful to the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal deep-seated differences between the races
The federal report of last week on mathematics achievement has made a good news for the public schools in Washington DC
Although the District remains far behind the top institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (CM1 cm2) are in far greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) is the persistent gap between the results of African-American and white, on both local and national plans.
The average performance of white children in Grade 4 (CM1) to WashingtonD C. increased during the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their comrades in class African-American has only increased by three points, with 209 to 212.
The difference of success has actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only to a point, from 245 to 244.
The blank result has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overview on a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1), when the first report NAEP District of 60 points was published (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups have increased in this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District have expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor, Adrian Fenty (Democrat) were powered by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the evidence at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame Brown (related Democrat), Member of the Council of DC and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that the 3-plus (college) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect him.
But the fear is that we don't spend enough of time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in trouble.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, schoolchildren classes of elementary cycle end and beginning of college that had not incorporated the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and are quite far behind with their peers.
Each day, the programme of math, for kindergarten classes (maternal) Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the District by the former head Clifford Janey, which should also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I think simply that we must continue to work to offer better responses to these students in less than a class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less success in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley studying the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to allocate your resources and your management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting may have political repercussions affecting this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other schools, it is trying to use of the middle-class whites and blacks.
We are focused to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our high schools so that all families, regardless of the location where they originate, be assured that their children will be able to get a good public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements for reducing the gap of success is length of traditional public school, now of 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with the Charter schools.
It requires about 200 days to have the strength to change, "said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, as a" starting point "to obtain even an increase in the next contract.
To make higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, descended and carved a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and rolling lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) Group explored Gettysburg where the cost of tuition of 690 $38 per year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed as enthusiastic.
Super That's where I will study! "exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide headed towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi,? said really predicated, when he said the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visited children in their journey of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: the issue is not about whether you go to the university.
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of children American born to Hispanic immigrants who have left the high school where became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university education which will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his college studies -- a significant achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, the majority of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school."
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations that will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying wings claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
Mentoring programs are also playing an important role to help Graciela and millions of children as they reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, it will refuse, "said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied the Latin American students.
We need to provide a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that supported the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as Gear Up (prepare you), it provides more than $300 millions per year to local school systems to organize the programmes of preparation for the university that begin when the students from families with low incomes are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60% entering university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil ministry receives agreements with oil companies 10 foreign
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract large oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty in the course of two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements achieved by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil of Iraq, struck down by dozens of years of war and of sanctions.
American companies came away with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only auction was lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of oil giants American in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies that pave the way, "said Husari Ruba, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, supported by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while the American military troops should withdraw dampened the oil companies, preventing them from entering with more than force in Iraq, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserves, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including the cost of labour were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks as they did not have to account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and brought their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
Russian firms Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, rose in price on contracts that other companies and left with significant interests in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and will achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions have made offers that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of Al Qaeda, this week, said Friday US counter-intelligence authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al- Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and the Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the interior of Pakistan's lawless tribal border.
They were driving a white car, moving towards the Afghan border, where the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking on the telephone from Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority said that the local militant suspects fled into place and rapidly seized what was left of the "totally shredded body."
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American counterterrorism officials provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Mercury Al Qaeda military organizers who ran the terrorist group's operations outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organise conspiracies in the world, said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic guidance of Al Qaida and translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al Qaida's and of very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of Al Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the drones of the CIA has declined since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the figures provided by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The special envoy of the United Nations in Kabul withdrew
The special envoy of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The envoy of the United Nations said that he supported this increase, but he expressed concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months, which would oblige the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international staff helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he resign but would be simply the commitment to his family, in March, to spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has the time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was preferable to begin to pursue my replacement, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Officials say the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is an Italian citizen - Switzerland who recently headed a mission of the United Nations in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, in September, was accused of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism in relation to the international observation of elections."
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged Heads of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would help to give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy employment regulations of the United Nations were its potential to bring in new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American troops in the north of Iraq, during a week-long visit in the areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier in the event of such an outcome Knut.
One of the things that I weighs most, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration sees a set of sanctions that would target military and political elite in Iran, but Gates noted that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that "a set of motivations and of punishment" may be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would be less secure with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer énormément' of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not back its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Agency for Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva, on 1 October, he said that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, way to develop a trust of both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be remote attempts agree - in part, say the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I believe, the stiffening of Iran in response to some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement at the beginning of October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to merge on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, "said Gates.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a long-term satisfactory solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met with the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before making the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to derencontrer Heads of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions remain between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding the borders, the rights of ownership and revenue sharing.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of American plans to reduce the number of American troops to 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to allay the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal in abeyance. the American authorities cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the regional government of Kurdistan: "we will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not let you down. "
In the aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown up surrounded by poster of propaganda preaching, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby in addition, it is a tomb in more."
If they have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the aging of the population, have radically changed management this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and strong: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
There's no second, said Wang, 31 years, director of human resources and has a son of eight months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the single child in China, creating two generations of children well with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years, and will shoot up more than 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1% in 2050. this figure is well over the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a population highly educated, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for about 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate of less than one child per couple.
Lingli Xie, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said that the fertile couples should have babies in order "to help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future."
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, indeed, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police the duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for Human Rights denounced the abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In the rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
Moreover, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio between girls and boys abnormally high.
In recent years, the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for the residents of cities, the members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their hard slogans.
Xiaochun Qiao, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Population Research Institute), at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed of even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children when one partner is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In a nothing of time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to make the request for authorization.
The government of the city has dispatched officials of family planning and volunteers to meet couples, in their home, and slip fliers under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing reply
While officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say that they have seen an increase in requests for files of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, in 2010, the number of births in the city is still expected only of about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Juying Feng, Head of the committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to cater to their first child, she said.
Jiawei Yang, 27 years old and his wife, Juanjuan Liu, 26 years, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they only insurance minimum health and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Western mistakenly see that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with seven months of the first child of the couple.
It is true, we stole the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of human resources, said that it did not want a single child because it was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and had the habit that everyone cares for us."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we don't take care of others. "
Zijian Chen, 42 years old and most told owner conveys a translation of society.
For couples, working at two of middle class, which reduces the birth rate, he said, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents fighting in the beginning of capitalist China and do not want to gain this style of life, "he said.
Even a single child asks a lot of time of his parents, he said.
A mother must abandon at least two years of his social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "you must change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group of plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- is back in the limelight of public attention Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting the majority of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, said the remaining obstacles, as much as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a Special Working Group of the United Nations, the text does not say how the rich countries would give poor to withstand global warming, and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It provides a great flexibility in the process, "said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club àWashington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, considered a text of 180 pages negotiations to focus on what was described by the United Nations Secretary-General executive on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture."
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while the main countries in developing countries, in the same period, are reduced by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95% in 2050.
The European Union has also restarted the negotiations Friday, promising to provide $3. 6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to withstand flooding and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since the last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States in the negotiation climate has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries, in comparison with voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of developing countries, said Stern lamented that the text is enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the main American negotiator, either lacked of "good sense," or was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help financially China to fight climate change.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of the individual economies that the rescue of the world, with China and the United States was on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two most influential dozens of countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are struggling to determine who should undergo the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, "said Ulate, which is also adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put the pressure to get a treaty legally obliged, in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, head of the unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most problems in proceeding before the heads of government arrive at an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be reviewed during the course of the next week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and exit the Palais des congres every day -- activists of guitar players present nocturnal performances mocking countries which they felt betrayed and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only grows: almost all key ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court major, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Heavy lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 kph will redefine Monday syndrome
5h13, Monday morning, a signal whether the night to report the departure of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first country's high-speed commuter train will reach 225 kph, while filera Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering the 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter train outside of London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to incorporate an international network of rapid and reliable trains and will link the large conurbations of Midlands, Northern and of Scotland in London.
The small corners will become successful commuter towns, the duration of business trips will be much less long and the passage of the aircraft and of the car to the train will reduce the national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of dangers for the environment are likely to curb the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make its document to Lord Adonis December 30.
This will enable him to get a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres from the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment will be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a larger high-speed network, towards the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a fishtail configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line split into two in or near Birmingham, with a branch going to the west of the àManchester Pennines and Scotland and another towards the northeast, toward Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"it seems that this will be the best option for Performance Manufacturing '," said rail provider.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a one-hour trip now.
The proposals will allow trains to travel 400 kilometers away / h, making the world's fastest British network.
The original route is designed to allow trains of 400 m long and that can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The experts of the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should be put in place, but longer public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Although it launched the machine, the network will be built by party.
The trains will initially be forced to drive on existing track outside high-speed lines north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure the passage of the planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan for the long Tory GBP 75
Alan Duncan, senior member of parliament Tory, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a long that it has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its loan of GBP 75,000 to build an extension in oak to his second home, in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the commons received complaints at the time and had not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, which conducts expenditure control. the last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be clearer or simpler. "
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby homes have been sold for almost one million pounds.
The main floor contains a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the office of the fees asserts that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, describing in his plans as an orange farm.
Neighbors described as a "porch for pleasure."
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give explanations for the loan increase during a recent investigation made by the Committee of Privileges and standards of the commons, on its prior loan provisions.
The Committee has cleared the last month of any accusation of noncompliance with the rules, after an investigation on its expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271.406 of his property in London at home in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about 1,400 GBP by borrowing interest months until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the borrowing of GBP 75,000.
The standard interest rate RBS in December 2007 rose from 6% to 4% in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the authorities of the commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1,250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position of Head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed stating that Members of Parliament had to survive "on budget" after the scandal of spending.
"in fact, it is now national, you must live" budget "and you are treated as... of the m
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I requested a small part, based on what was correct."
And I would have been able to claim a damned sight smarter, but I did not. "
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former position as a dealer in oil, began to have to explain its expenditure, in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of books for his garden, prior to agree with the office of the costs that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the form of GBP in the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Last night, asked about the increase of the loan, Mr Duncan said: "it was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the office expenses and by Legg."
He added: "there is no problem of evasion or development or use rules or anything."
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or simpler. "
Worshippers, all see the timing of Advent of Brighton
The beach cabins of Brighton have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive of Advent calendar.
A group of the church alternative that encourages spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30pm to 6.30pm, every day, with warm pate and wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a marketing assistant TV in Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "we want religion to be closer people in a society post Christianity."
"as a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange?" it seems to me that the church should connect people and celebrate in a more exciting. "
"the idea of Advent calendar of beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner."
Brighton is a very creative and vibrant and we are trying to experiment and to represent it in spirituality. "
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, actions
The union of prison guards called Friday on the "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the holidays of year-end bonuses and overtime payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
TF - prison (2nd union of supervisors) asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in prisons and to "block", to "denounce the theft of their due.
The CGT - Prison (3rd union of the profession) calls to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilisation" as "shameful and unacceptable" payment in December not "additional hours of night, on Sundays and on public holidays, bonuses" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the independent Federal Union prison (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to help discontent and anger."
The Department of Corrections and the Department of Justice explain that the extra hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the direction of the Prison Service to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a poor evaluation of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, "says Alliot-Marie.
The pay of December will be lean, except for officers receiving famous premiums for functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for which "the budgetary constraints have good back."
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and invitations."
The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those in the month of October are not regulated in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO RhÃ´ne-Alpes.
At the time of increasing our work and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare take money staff, believes the CGT prison of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some less worse than others.

If the court refuses to abandon the prosecution, Mr Hummel called for the holding of a trial, which would allow it to present evidence of his arguments.

Mr Hummel was not the only one to request the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client will no longer be harassed for every rebound of the case Polanski, she added: "nobody in this room can say that the process was fair."

The son of singer, air relaxed, assured that he would make "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection after the operation for a discal hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and administer its treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors of the hospital Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection after the operation for a discal hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to be pathologist in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
For his wife went Friday morning at the French of Los Angeles where attends their daughter Jade, to attend a school performance, found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the hospital in la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer vehemently challenged the Dr. Stephane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinique International Park Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible court to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I got this online doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was stunned, because I did have two spinal disk hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic community.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Oxford, where he was performing at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate a hematoma in the wake of a cerebral hemorrhage.
But it is also a physician to Zuma's reputation, condemned several times by the court, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of Doctors, accused him of a "rogue" prosecution "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stephen Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
It noted that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and would not require any the installation of a drain," he added.
In all of the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (Amiens, Ed) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and amount the New Center not to use its logo
The association UDF, controlled by the vote of confidence of FranÃ§ois Bayrou, responded Friday to the takeover attempt by the president of the New Center, Herve Morin, the acronym for the former giscardien, in advocating not to use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Herve Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that Francois Bayrou was not worthy of defending his legacy after extended our hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (former UMP past NC) which claims ownership of the trademark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of FranÃ§ois Bayrou who do not intend to let dispossession, emerged from his silence to launch a demand for the Minister and MP, not to use the summoning the acronym and to convey the ownership of the trademark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements that you would suggest to your political movement of + resume + acronym UDF, written association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of vote of confidence, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist of the Alliance.
You have also chosen to follow militant on your equipment and on the page of custody of your site, the name of this movement, + New Center +, the slogan + the UDF today's +, noted the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the logo, explains the office of the UDF which is still the NC to withdraw "immediately the name of the UDF of any medium (as well as its website.
He asked Mr Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) mark to his legitimate successors."
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of adherents of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they indicate that the UDF "is a political movement in full since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a rival movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
The New Center has not, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the vote of confidence for three years and the establishment of an office responsible for defending the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, continued the office, "when it filed the mark," he was no longer participant of the UDF for three years ", but the UMP.
He criminally and fraudulently benefit from the absence of filing of the acronym UDF to conduct for his account.
This effect is in the process of transforming itself into an offence, denounce they, prior to make ironic comments on the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself and try to get out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: Francois Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist Francois Marie Banier to determine whether, as acknowledging the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob a portion of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be judged 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and of EUR 375 000 fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fell out while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oreal.
But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical report of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be done collegially by three doctors.
The heir and major shareholder of L'Oreal has always refused to comply with such a review, certainly not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre in the investigation.
Doctors appointed Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010 in saying whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been situated in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think it will submit.
I will talk, "said of Mrs Bettencourt counsel at the exit of the hearing, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Francoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Mr Olivier Metzner, expressed appreciation for the decision of the court.
This is good news... expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against Francois Marie Banier, photographer and entertainer, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to get a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of teachers.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which it regards as a long-standing friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Mrs Bettencourt Meyers, the arguments of the lawyers have sometimes turned to unpacking family Friday.
Thus, the lawyer for Liliane Bettencourt referred to three letters sent by his client (in 1999) to his notary, 2003 and 2005, in which she said beware the husband of Francoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice daily for fifteen years."
Francoise, I have never been able to talk since her marriage. "
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again suggested that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a juvenile judge has refused in recent days to allow its application to open a judicial procedure of protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and does not have a guardian."
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the prosecutor, Marie - Chrsitine Daubigney."
The court has finally decided that it would take action once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of major French enterprises, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will be lost...
For more than a dozen years, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, said corporate position on consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the "values" determined collaborators top as they once were, impose consumers of products designed by technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquest of markets to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products of fruits of clients return periodically!
The demobilization of employees can result in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much broader phenomenon which affects in particular frameworks.
This demobilization is seriously hampering the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including of R & D and, even more, of the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the CI "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires of employees' commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally annoyed.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would make the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as a customer.
The relevance of the internal opinion surveys
The internal investigation of opinion - as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I think not.
- firstly because I saw that, faced with a new situation, any structure comes eventually, after many detours, as do... what she has always done.
Secondly, because authoritarianism - a pathology of power increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major schools of engineering, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt rejects, with intellectual comfort, the old theory, revived recently by American "Neuroscience" and, to their knowledge, widely disseminated by the institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro fr confirms she leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the fund-raising factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary to the proper functioning of modern enterprises, requires to adopt a finalist vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clearly as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, of their ambitions, of their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they feel their company based on a pre-determined governing orthodoxies that allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and submit their management of human resources in the area. "
They create a breeding ground for coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "just war" is right to praise Obama
The Fire welcomed Friday the speech in Oslo by Barack Obama, met the day before the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had Union the award of the prize to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, along the lines of Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency in the election of 2008.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, creative partner of the right wing of the Republican Party, the daily USA Today, adding personally addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my view that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists there, she felt.
Mr Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor, George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo "for the very good job."
I found that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
By some side, I have found this quite historic speech, "said Mr Gingrich, interviewed on the radio program" The Takeaway. "
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was thrilled to see "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr Obama made a "very American discourse."
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "Europeans" they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do little to preserve, "said Mr Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, spouted and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
On the left of the president, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When envelope the war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press remained however laudatory to the location of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, called his statement of "spectacular" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," has ignited the Californian newspaper.
Mr Obama "made the speech that he needed," said the New York Times, saying "both dark and instructive."
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations - marathon, the road sector unions and TLFs, only employers' organization to be stayed until the end, reached Friday evening to an agreement that ends the watchword of strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
During the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement after several sessions of negotiations, begun on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions negotiators had left early Friday morning, with the hope to sign quickly by the end of morning the text.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting started at 11.00 for everyone agrees that the text should be signed.
The conflict "would have been very harmful for businesses" and "it was feared that they disrupt the holiday season in years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages in the local and regional road transport), and by 2.9% for the highest (shipping).
In hourly rate for low-wage, "from 8.72 euros to 29.06."
It's not much, but it is by far, said Patrice Clos (FO).
This is the order will give our activists that there is not a deadlock, not of blockade of the centres of supplies.
But we can always have some holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high-wage because of international competition."
He said the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and of 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of good sense and the respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed" an historic agreement. "
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has mentioned "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of 3% of the cost of travel, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will help to address the issue of a 13th month and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau reiterated that "a decrease of 100 million euros of the employer's contributions" has been the subject of a government amendment to the draft bill corrigendum for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on the "identical".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies initially to member companies to this organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
FNTR denounced "a fool", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary? state transportation was obliged to negotiate in the urgency, not in conclusion? shared analysis, but not to thwart the turkey eaters of the group's next, deplored the UNOSTRA.
For the Otre, the agreement risk "of digging the grave d? a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
PER: disruption over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A, the largest line of urban transit authorities in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday at the 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left them on their hunger on their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains between 2 and 7, with one train in two on the central section (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change train.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 clients each day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP should make efforts to serve the big stores."
The RER A crosses from west to east Greater Paris.
The RATP segment short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre at Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne - The Valley.
Friday, about a train on two circulated to peak hours, and almost no paddle off-peak times, as planned.
Since Thursday, there has not been a melee on the docks, Franciliens organized.
And in the morning, the site of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than usual, especially because of the lack of school students.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "an hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time."
The Saint-Lazare station had not known of saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a coaching staff and of law enforcement.
The RER A made by the SNCF from or to Cergy - not forgetting The High were arriving or departing from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, considered "lean" by the unions, in a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on the RER A, working on all aspects of career development etc.
This is not what they want drivers, who are demanding a bonus, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP will even put its proposals in brackets premium, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the management "was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What has also told the unions that the company "made fun of the users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a board headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which previously refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" meeting.
The conflict threatens to spill over RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on the line in daily million passengers.
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career, affect of 2,200 to 2,700 gross euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish, heavy consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court has ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision which was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to vastly complicate the task of the government, which comes to extend a helping hand to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the president of the Court Hasim Kilic, at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken at the unanimity of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to deliver the dissolution, said Mr Kilic, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Tugluk 1995, are banned from politics for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed Mr Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP disposes of 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as Members without labels.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), regarded as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party maintains however that it was "not of organic links with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has to extend a helping hand to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to dry up the support of the Kurds in the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had stated that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in the southeast Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Immediately after the announcement of the judiciary, a thousand demonstrators gathered at the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city populated southeast majority of Kurds.
The forces of order fired tear gas and using water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails and rocks, with slingshots.
More than 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, Ed) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This solves nothing, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total sinking of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon Valley"
For a long time it was the reputation of secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research of the secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" Soviet.
Major production and research sites in micro- and buildings are located.
As early as September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg Science mehr Licht - with the academic institutes and companies in the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (world-wide).
There are reciprocal meetings and Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were the Vice Mayor of Moscow Rosljak for the Russian delegation and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd, Edwin Schwarz Manager section for Frankfurt.
The world-wide and SME representatives in 2010, whose strength is the scientific research for a seminar, will conduct Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will enable the world-wide companies enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Unlike Russian scientific societies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of institutes and of famous Soviet research companies.
It is the Institute of Electrical in Moscow, the major Sitronics firms and Rosssijskaja - Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for research into weapons.
Zelenograd (literal translation City Green) derives its name from the wooded hills in the heart which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
We cannot place high the enormity of Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters anything from "new heart of Europe".
If it is. S21, it is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a hopeless chaos of construction projects for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head of line, with lines that ended in town, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century which were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic as it once needed a lot of time to get the locomotives from front to rear.
Arrival, stop short, departure - this is what needs to be done.
That is why the station head of line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station of passage of trains, which is about halfway on the terrible rail between Paris and Budapest Transeuropéenne / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are long compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and in Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations head of line no longer pose a real of entry and exit problems since it exists with modern, reversible cars and car trains pilot at the two ends.
However, it is now launching the achievement of Stuttgart 21 beside the realignment of the line inter-city towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies won the day.
The company of railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who makes the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
In terms of city planning this project is quite justified.
Yields an urban area - if we believe the graphic planners generated by computer - will be very green.
For rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The station of passage and the enlargement of the section is designed for a human trafficking which was - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth.
At the time it was not yet the cheap flights competition.
The modern traffic policy should focus on strengthening the freight traffic first because the transport by rail is much more respectful of the environment and by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not appropriate for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the Bolzano.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will for other points of junction and congestion on the network.
The list of the Department of Transportation says 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine good 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line was built in slow motion.
It would be truly urgent to support here in substance on the fungus.
But the project S21 is the effect of a brake shoe.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming a bottleneck of international freight traffic, and the middle of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appealing to the judgement of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of flights at night.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP coalition had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Court, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court in Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the trail of aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt Airport would be reached.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between March and shell in the morning, as envisaged by the government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make a cassation appeal against the judgement.
The opposition criticizes this time and attempts to pressurise the government representative for cirenonce appeal with the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer parliamentary group - Gümbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban on night flights; otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a word.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word, "said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir in referring to the electoral slogan of" we want our promises. "
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer - Gümbel which claims that the Land government tries to allow still of night flights using "avocasserie and of roublardises."
It takes time to perform a specific legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression."
It is important that the decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the declarations of its portion on the ban on night flights is completely érronée.
US banks reimburse the aid
Very affected by the crisis, the large US banks, shedding of their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion), reflecting the aid granted in the context of the rescue plan Tarp.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to reimburse the aid received.
Banking institutions and seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to the leader and the settlement of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase of capital through the sale of securities to investors who reported $19 billion of money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's funds, which are met through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed in its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also planning to purchase of money on the financial markets in order to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The American bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion dollars, reported the channel CNBC citing the banking community.
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the bank Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public money they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally has still risen faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the position of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the Council of Administration of the German channel ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin draft ZDF was the arch-favorite.
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - voting in order to not anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the steward of the ZDF Markus Schachter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schachter, needed the vote of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the writing of this edition.
A fortnight ago, Schachter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had declared their support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against. the dismissal by a vote of Brender represented a major setback although predictable for Schachter.
Indeed, the CDU majority in the Council of Administration had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of esteemed writer chief extension on the grounds that the listenership of ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on ZDF.
At the end there was 35 experts in public law infringed on the debate and who felt that the conduct of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will be helped.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the Science-Policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio body) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German newspaper with national reach).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first the news magazine "heute - newspaper (" today's newspaper).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy of the editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 was manager and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (biweekly information morning); until 2001 he was responsible for foreign policy in the service of the ZDF and head of the writing in Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch in the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant staff may not be blocked by a one-sided political majority.
However, Beck does not to ask for the withdrawal of the politicians of ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender had skillfully maneuvered to the Administrative Board in criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schachter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Administrative Council could elect without placing as partisan politics.
Arithmetic in the representations of the parties, Frey ranked liberal left-wing.
Cleaning up university
Partial success for students: after a year of strike educational ministers of education and cultural affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the ministers and delegates to the conference of rectors, an agreement has been developed stating that the working conditions of students Bachelor and Master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to deal with their studies.
They particularly accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single review should help to close the study module.
Moreover, the burden of work would be reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions."
The political authorities and academic institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also vowed to organize more flexible common structural requirements for the channels of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, it should not be a different regulation of a Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university presidents have repeatedly to mouth the buzzword: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning.
The accreditation council decided to reduce significantly the number of certain tests: "each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single review," can be read in a document of a total of 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to the university.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of Accreditation said that by sharply reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop attacks, causing significant étudiabilité.
"the étudiabilité" should furthermore be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this smothering sensation that you feel sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary margin for manoeuvre to allow and encourage the personal initiative."
The new regulation will affect access to new graduate but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be re-certified every five years, which means, however, that it was not until 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies on the entire federal territory that depend on the accreditation council set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programs are not too loaded and the regime not too strict examinations.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have given its agreement to give more money to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of reviews and the service of international relations
The Länder and universities provide for it a budget of 10 million.
Early 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
After that it will spend only one examination to conclude his studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, more must be able to ensure the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the étudiabilité "of all university review.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont appreciated but critics have been heard.
The Federal President of the union of the socialist students indicated that he would like the organization of the educational policy no longer happens in the future "behind the closed doors of ministers and university presidents.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Presidents (Netherlands) Wintermantel Margret: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the Netherlands is working on a project of common reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. it claims the right and the opportunity for every bachelor graduate to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the GEW also calls for the Länder provide students bachelor today that tomorrow there will be sufficient capacity to master studies and education conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more of lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education have not mentioned the possibility of easing access to master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control..." begins a work of the poet Söllner Werner, in which he dealt with in the disturbing bits of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany that has gained freedom but lost at the same time its linguistic territory.
Söllner Werner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collections in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the Chair highly coveted of poetry from the University of Frankfurt Goethe and since 2002 he was director of Hesse forum of literature in the house of Mousonturm artist in Frankfurt.
He has done a great deal of him in literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files."
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers Romanian as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The test recruitment began insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner finds "someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais intimidation" of the Securitate.
The poet Söllner Werner is the informant Walter (MI Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its best literary trouble with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, a case that clearly shows the abyss and baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securitate, MI Walter played a role, provides the specialist of literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of MI Walter intercédé in its favour.
"he was able to pull in all difficult situations at the time", according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement before the public was unexpected, but the confession of a former dissident of its cooperation with the Romanian secret services is not in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate was already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit", after having read the 914 pages of its own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have been speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany where meanwhile the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was repeatedly thwarted and constrained in the past.
It was not until 1999 that a national council for the Birthler institution was created to work with the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of files rather dragged since.
There are since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar which, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Muller, said in a very dismissive in respect of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it had questioned once.
The infamy of power thought voice here, under the guise of freedom of expression without any gene.
Of course, many of the inevitable questions are linked to the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? who has been robbed? the measured listeners, the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge and by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday the Nobel prize, it's more than a footnote.
Turmoil in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived here, fired four plucked from a Christmas party nice pins, on which the manufacturer of sportswear had spread its goods when the new coach Forrest Christian Gross took the quarter to midnight a Mercedes Class C, that he had just called, a plastic bag of supplier in the hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have driving - he did not drink alcohol and it was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it should return to work.
It is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that it had to hire three days earlier were clear: "we have reached the eighth of final", i.e. in the Champions League through our 3: 1 against limited Unirea of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. this will be a brutal struggle to stay."
The "big job" us Sunday. "
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three hurried goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots
The eighth of final of the Champions League match go 16 (17) (+ 23 / 24 February / game return 9). (+ 16). (. (March 18, will be randomly selected. December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant inauguration of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate among those who had brought luck, who had sent professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, unfailing motivation and pleasure to play.
I see the players and I said that they should focus on their strengths, I have advised to be more courageous, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais which had not been effects with the Babbel trainer.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel, "in football when there is a new impetus happens sometimes things that we never thought possible."
And Khedira Sami, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" noted by a "proverbial fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "it is someone who is taking action and demands of discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation ".
But Babbel apparently failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs of tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager is careful not to overstate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, Khedira objected.
Heldt Horst, the manager, reported that they had achieved the goals of the season, but that they had not yet.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
Heldt the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to make the celebration, even after the first victory at home for three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others are not Jens, confounded Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He accused the leadership of weakness in style and said that she had decided to change coaches under the pressure of pubertal fans.
Lehmann had found also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and of jalousiele because his day of free after games had been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" broke Heldt and announced consequences for the guardian of purpose.
They were more likely to become friends for life both 40-50 year.
In any cast, they agreed to everything, that is, without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "for a large share in the success" replied Heldt and Lehmann together - and even the plastic bag obliged.
World Cup heavyweights
Hot battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenger caused constantly verbally and gestural expression world champion Vitali KLITSCHKO.
But after 12 hard rounds Ukrainian defended the title of world champion of heavy vehicles from the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimity of the judges became points.
Hamburg - Vitali KLITSCHKO retains his title of world champion of heavy vehicles.
The WBC Federation announced that in the night of Saturday the champion of 38 years of judges had won a victory in points in the unaminité against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time KLITSCHKO with honour defends his title since its very on stage in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he failed the long-awaited KB.
KLITSCHKO, left 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, the admit defeat twice because of injury.
Johnson's challenger of accepting his first battle 24th.
In the Berne) before 17,000 spectators, the great KLITSCHKO mainly wanted to dictate the fight, the top of its 2.02 meters, with his left.
Johnson, of 11 centimetres smaller, which before the duel had announced the end of the era KLITSCHKO, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, and empéchant KLITSCHKO to bring into play its far-right detrimental.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to cause in words and deeds KLITSCHKO punches reached rarely champion.

This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali KLITSCHKO which was to be held in September.
It would appear that his promotional company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jurgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lies in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD party and The Left Party (Die Linke) asked Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) délibérémentdissimulé certain facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the strike deadly of two trucks in September, said the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jurgen Trittin, Saturday in the course of the issuance of information from the ARD channel "Tagesschau (the newspaper from 8pm).
This means that he lied.
The order to kill has been given to the total disregard of the rules of Afghanistan's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
It is, in substance, the content of the report before NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen truck, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the report of investigation of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the American air attack that was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible to the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jurgen Trittin and his colleague from the party of the Greens Renate Künast felt that Ms. Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan government fédéralet if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the actions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, there were increasingly high to express doutesquant the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the department.
According to the newspaper's SPIEGEL information, the information that they had surrendered to Guttenberg regarding the attack of tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and some ministerial hidden embarrassing details.
In the entourage of the two officials suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein as well as a report of the military police.
"the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, it has not received a reply
Saturday, the department declined comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday in order to bring light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some see awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mental patients, or under the influence of the drug, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
Until these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we lengthened our darkened rooms, we can enjoy unfettered access to the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hears and sees things that others don't perceive, quickly reputation in our western world to be mad or drugged, or for the less original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental patients or under the influence of the drug.
What is at stake is our imagination: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint charts or write novels, but which sometimes encourages the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious wakefulness, taking the form of a dream, may appear in the most diverse forms, at best this is called visions, the worst of the madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect is distinguished, visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, psychosis and hallucinations, the latter statements of shamans are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions where the balance of the neurotransmitter substances in the brain - first dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine break and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thinking occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The land force of attraction has no power over the individual.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors always focused on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream - awake; Griesinger Wilhelm, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose."
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into character in a comic book.
His body is in two dimensions to the harsh colours.
The Earth's attraction has no power over him, he hangs tsunami of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind the winged creatures of hell, grimaçantes, mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give of kicks with heavy boots lay against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thundering voice, nasty, howl, outgoing walls and radio.
It cannot bear these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. tore two cables for his stereo, indeed a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He mounted on a baffle and goes on the loop around the neck.
It is obvious.
The loop stands out.
That you should be a lesson to us, cry the voices in a chorus to extract the eardrum. "is in a clinic and do treat yourself!"
Now Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last day of two years, the first of almost twenty years.
It was triggered by the drug.
The diagnosis: psychosis nutso - emotional, paranoid, manic depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I have experienced terrible fear and deep despair.
The illusions is a cruel reality.
A per cent of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in the psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, individuals may no longer be the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of excitement, they may suffer from hallucinations, of megalomania, relational of madness or of persecution.
It is quite common to hear voices, voices command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person may not make the distinction between the important and the trivial, the brain may not filter disruptive signals, the conscious is deluged with sensations.
Like the dream, the psychosis opens the sluices through deeper layers of ideas and of fantasies a tide of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at Heidelberg Chu (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in middle of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it occurs in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them in an active manner.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, handled.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, illusion is a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "sensory and spatial structure of the reality that is collected during the psychosis, is basically kept."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on the reality, the alienation of the experiences in a real framework.
Why does our brain this kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations may lead anyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the people involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explained.
But what remains unclear is how the neural system abnormality and furthermore the fact that it was not seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on the neurotransmitter.
When our brain heats.
What is crazy, says the professor of psychology Erich Kasten in Lübeck, is that the stalkers suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs for it while others purchase drugs dearly for them.
Pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years of reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the unreal world in our heads."
The hallucinations are phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
They include mental problems such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to note that in some circumstances even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, under Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that address the sensory perception, are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of the participants acknowledged having made at least once in her life experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and it goes to high school.
A young girl to do everything normal indeed.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recess, it happens that a young boy with long chestnut hair, thin, send him the floor.
When she replied his comrades watch, surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this young girl timid is a lunatic dreaming but Sarah K not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hear and see the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is seated beside her on the bench.
It can even collect its presence momentarily.
It is a good feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, wonders she sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real, and that they will disappear again.
The night, in general, the appearances are frightening.
Often the visions are burdensome.
When it is in class, it happens that it can monitor the course because the teacher is just in the process of presenting a new pupil in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly in the process of explaining equations to the table.
The night, in general, the appearances are frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, she expects the sleep that comes too infrequently and far too late, it may not make the distinction if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, grimaçants faces or the girl with bloody gashes on his arms and legs are open or closed to his eyes.
Let me alone, Cree says these creatures.
She did not speak to his parents and his friends, they would for a mad.
: Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her ferry last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
There is a year hallucinations ceased.
Since it came into contact by Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or not enough of stimulation, the probability is high that it has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not addressed, ensures that there will be of animation.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of the other children when she was small and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not her real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "every experience," Kasten "occurs in the brain, the reality is formed from there."
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
In contrast with schizophrenia, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step from the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the awareness tends to take the imaginary experience unfortunately quickly for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of hospital Florence Nightingale in Dusseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful but which also contains something of positive, of creator madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard studied the form of oniroïde so-called experience, a form of the amendment of the conscience awakened from the dream.
The oniroïdes stem dreams semi- complex that are seen as real live and that it cannot distinguish the dream even when he is awake.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during trauma or in extreme situations of diseases such as for patients with polyradiculopathie fully aware, experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a complete and lasting inability to move, it replaces the real situation that undermines his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from the reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, a capacity for organization that has been given to us men, not sink into nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also described his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain immobile resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created from scratch, foreign site visit, travel through time. it is old bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside ensuring on his health.
He lives in the median age of nobles who manufacture drugs of blood.
He was abducted by a Greek motorcycle brought in her country with her hospital bed, we get in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memory.
According to Claussen these journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes in describing what he lived.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental trips are extremely clear and detailed years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experiences.
The intensity of the experiences shattered the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes mania, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experience shows how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile even in a state of intelligence.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience which can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall
Burda
For 27 years, the children will take the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO editions Burda is an intermediate solution: over the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children resume the press group, he said to the newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees its society between the hands of his children
The two children will inherit to 27 years and are firmly committed to integrate the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will thereafter.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the capacity to handle.
This will demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda reported last Thursday that it was withdrawing the President Director General from as early as January and that his successor was Paul - Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, is a member of the Council of Administration since 1999.
It was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took over the Treasury that it was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Todenhöfer he also the head of marketing, of the foreign sector of printing and finance.
And for the first time this is not a member of the family that is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda have 19 and 17 years respectively, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also used to make the connection of 10 or 15 years
Burda said that the holding company must remain 100% between the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families of capital that have left by lead to overeating, which have made huge unfortunate speculation in thinking that they could rise still higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had a rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I see no in the role of tutor to the country as could be and I do not intend to be part of the international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken far too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his Email, without providing the opportunity even to see some kind of attachments or to surf the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designation as one of the products of the year.
Indeed, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of life for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited by its large - American brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone know what is to abandon the data when it crosses a border or to seek desperately a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of a regulation at a fixed price is incredibly attractive, and it is a long time that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options trip, but personally, I would need a thesis in physics to understand and good glasses to read the fine print.
The reminders to repeated the order of the European Commission to offer affordable rates of roaming across Europe took a barely perceptible effect.
Outside of their country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it is not wrong.
A small aircraft such as the FonPeek (it is still curious that he called Fon while it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying various proposals to enable them to profitable network of data.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without hardship.
It is a device connected and pay for its purchase and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek proposed in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish simply because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the assumption of office of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and jacket, indeed, of the color, she chose to support it in the second time, without any doubt, the most important of his life: the surrender to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a very similar model in these two instances: similar color, yellow pulling the green with bright glare, both times, the holding consisted of three parts: the mantle, in the same tissue dress, jacket and with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So that a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States should follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to deliver the same suits.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different.
If the decisionmaking function was a thick lace, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green medium heel shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but gold, this time.
The headdress also has changed: the hair is now identified as it was released last time.
75% of mothers who work have had problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for the women of the young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study "Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", performed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of mothers who work have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
The study shows that there are many differences concerning the beginning of the couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the kind of employment.
Those who are not of part-time work outside the home, work, or have an unstable work begin earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
However, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry into the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, averaging 3.7 years after being installed in couples. this figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women with stable employment needed over time in their lives to obtain, which led him to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence largely motherhood, but less the starting date of common life ", explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that is widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and for their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, marry and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49, those who have made elementary and graduate studies were respectively mother for the first time at $25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"another distinctness, as it seems, depending on their level of education among women.
While those who have completed elementary school marry and have their first child before to find steady employment, studies of average or higher level reverse this program and give priority to the achievement of a stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child ", says Ms. Delgado.

The poker of aces of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) dozen writers of "X-rays" that have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It is not in the foreseeable and anticipated genres (biographical, life and work), but in seeking something of similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a poignant invitation to readings and reviews.
I will now give a snapshot.
Albert Camus: "in its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical rush, while I felt without naming her: the pleasure from the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliste, Christian allegory, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head with a poetic comedy, between ignorance and powerlessness, dazzling, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that failed the kill."
Graham Greene: "this woman has been inspired by our man with a passion which lasted 13 years ago, in the flesh of which he he the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach the sky by the road to perdition."
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach; it is about one of the peaks of eight thousand metres of world literature, the need to climb the north face, on which the best climbers quit yet."
William Faulkner: "it was a strange type.
For himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner County and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams of grandeur. "
Louis Ferdinand Celine: "this writer was the lunatic cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to bring its echo down to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and invoking the be remembered with a violent speech maggots."
Dorothy Parker: "one day she began to its knees and prayed:" God beloved, you beg to do that I stop writing as a woman. "
Joseph Conrad: "on his grave were engraved to Spenser:" sleep after exercise, after the storm the port, the rest after the war, after the life, tired death delights. "
Virginia Wolf: "it was carrying in his luggage depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally say to him that Edward VII watched among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We never saw a man as patient and in love with a love whose literary talent exceeded the madness. "
"by Santos except to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja?
Benet except to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did This except to suck the glory of this man to serve as a pedestal? "
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years ago, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and of our dog, a blood - mélé, saved from the APS and not weighing more than six kilograms, and without word, they assenèrent two rounds of feet that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is huge, because we do not see what it is funny to attack free small defenceless animals, moreover, was left.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and that, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man and, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode occurred around 17 hours, Tuesday as another in a normally quiet neighbourhood.
The dog has gémi all day.
We obviously complained to the police station in the district although we doubt that this serves to much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outcry led to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people to find fun to mistreat free a helpless animal which provides for the condition, of friendship and is company.
We do not know where went good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, primarily among younger riders, as both structures have mentioned today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident with two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products still safer" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative nature.
This new campaign of encouragement helmet on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop always safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' organisation Anfac and of Ganvam manufacturers, dealers.
However, it is necessary to qualify the good news, as the benchmark for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
Therefore, despite the rebound of the last month, the accumulated registrations in the 11 months are 40% below from those of the previous year.
Since January, adding up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and trucks with lightweight chassis) 95 853 were sold.
Large clouds that most affect their application have not dissipated. indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, besides the restrictions involved in the limitation of banking credits, we must add other factors such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and the difference in tourism, subsidies for the purchase of the vehicles 2000E poorly served.
In addition to the individuals, independents and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a carbon emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of transactions speaks of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam recalled again the need for the administration to attach special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of dealers provides a 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which she calculates a drop in sales of cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency brake is now mandatory
As has occurred with the anti-lock brakes ABS and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, the system of emergency brakes will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and the newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles of waiting period was set until late February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, in its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant for emergency braking in increasing pressure on the emergency brakes detected by the system through kick given by the driver.
But he did not retains the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all the cars were equipped with this type of material, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent systems of emergency braking: it is calculated that a disaster on four with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or camera detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver responds, increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device carries the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors regrowth until January plan for Opel
While the workers from Opel Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April - probably the 8, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need to further time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may imply that the final document, which will be first submitted to the workers and the governments of the countries where the plants, or postponed until early 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admitted in contact with new leads.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch car manufacturer of sport Skyper, supported by the Russian group of Converg, takes the importance.
If there would agree with any of them, GM could sell a portion of the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewelry, engineers of Porsche went and managed to deplete the Boxster rescue nothing less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance with only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to dispense automatic, first, the roof was replaced by a manual sheeted roofs to reduce of 21 kilograms, to use aluminum doors like those of the Close, 15 other kilos of age, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing bacquets of sport, still 12 kilograms, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they abandoned the audio system RDC -30, winning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes door handles in tissue, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the KDP box with dual clutch, the test was done on a model with manual transmission six, mainly on roads in the secondary network of California, mountain, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour cannot be described as beyond reproach.
The decline of the weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was long that we had not tested as small and light a model that, in the same time, guaranteed of security in the turns, including high-speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its small musclesà speed at the time, until we urged him to sprint, to curb, to recover and to push new motor...
What we wanted was OUT. thanks to his leadership, communicative and precise, the car will do what will indicate our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His motor control
The sound of his BOXER V6, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether in the judgment or of recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating roads we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was somewhat damaged, but the car has managed to potholes.
The electronic assistants did just act of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found the ice in the morning and gravels, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, fun-filled to lead and that is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon and occasional starlette line parades of the house, the singer displays his face of bad girl with as many capacity than its bags Chanel.

The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received a resounding triumph in 91 - 82 during his visit to the difficult terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences facing the team of Dusko Ivanovic. it is head of his group, after the big show of Mirza Teletovic which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team of Vitoria has bridged the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and of collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win the victory.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points marked, largely determined final victory.
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage right from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked from the perimeter, presaged that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with hot wrist.
English and Teletovic were the leaders of the 18 - 20 final of the first quarter of.
The second quarter of was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the domestic game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of return to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34 - 43).
Teletovic was already starting to gain recognition as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although less "six evaluation of Splitter left already predicts that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the way to the break, nothing was played, far away, and the team of Avala wanted to remind those of Vitoria not so easily won on the ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elias, they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed in a decisive way to what the yellow take the advantage on the light (50 - 49).
Other challenges
The players for Ivanovic, injured but far from dead, needed to follow a few clever actions to take the air, and it is at this time that arises the definition of Teletovic Mirza, who with three baskets in three consecutive points and the help of English and of Ribas handed the meter to a reassuring score (54 - 67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter of (57 - 67).
The team of Avala got to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) put authorities on notice that they were tired person take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, and not résignèrent tried to support from the line of three points (70 - 77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for misconduct, Ivanovic players not rushed, defended well, and although the Israeli are reconciled at the last minute (80 - 85), the party was already played and for the first time outside of Tel Aviv victory of the season.
The injury prevents the Unicaja of battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in the face of the Olympiacos and broke the top of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players in the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga has not been frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of the Peace and of the Friendship or by the scope of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe, with a big budget.
The game of the first quarter of helped to dream the Andalusian. an aggressive defense and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and a Guillem Rubio who dazzled team 12 - 18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the interior of Bourousis game, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to reverse the score 22 - 20, in the 13th minute, when a share, a start to fight, between the North American leaders and Williams has resulted in the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began to function in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of mainstay Joel Freeland and the three misconduct of Carlos Jimenez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and the Lithuanian wingman Kleizas Linas, with their baskets to three points, dug benefit 44 - 32, in the 19th minute.
A possible rebound
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed superior and bomber to match the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66 - 48, at the 27th minute, observing the head of the group.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the final exit from the pivotal Scottish Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, thanks to his organization, the Unicaja three-point baskets of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66 - 57 in the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when players pushed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian hub Vujcic Nikola, managed to trace the score to 81 - 62, in the 37th minute, and the Unicaja said, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, business for the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he is refugee since September 21, before that date.
"it was aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must seek an alternative destination".
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "my position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government", said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that it would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy to impose on the government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
Pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant note, the uncertainty arises again on the markets, which is not surprising since it comes to their natural state, in an environment where officials take decisions on an uncertain future in nature.
The remedy employed by central banks to stabilise the market has been to monetize the debt through direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalized and, without jeopardising their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year in the next week.
Consequently, investors are skeptical of the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and differences in business obligations rise again, although they remain very distant levels and occultism achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize risk private and public debt was again affected.
There was again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase of differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new revision to the decline of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying again to induce a case of awareness among lesresponsables of the global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of the job, whereas what should be done is declaring a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal fight between the sheikhs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the ruse.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after DurÃ£o Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that the Ecofin Hungary saves a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member of the euro area of not respecting its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government to transparency and make its citizens share of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardisation of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences in public debt grows to the extent of European business obligations, nousn' not have to worry about.
If the European gap decreased and that our people continued to grow, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. when our predictors require most educational services to anticipate their model for recovery and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the office with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to form an excellent opportunity to buy assets from Spain, although for the moment "caution is a mother of safety".
Sectors connected
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days of Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined to the press that he had spoken to the subcommittee in camera.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 millions of euros until 2020 and 60 000 million between then and 2030, where nuclear plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60,000 millions but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to the increase in the production capacity, but distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will be necessary to increase the power.
His bet focuses both gas and coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW of more necessary, with other "energies of support".
Del, who believes that the draft Law of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what claims his company, decided not to attack the royal decree designed to encourage domestic coal consumption, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
He said there are "a long-term clear bet" in this sense, despite the one-off "measures", as described by the president of Iberdrola.
In any case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, as they put some time before reaching maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the market for the handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services in ten airports where it occurs.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are part of the most important.

On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation to create the Innovation Centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance provides a $20-million investment until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on the highways and airports.
Acciona dispute its first expressway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for his first highway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business energy and water manager.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 millions euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometers in length in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a business of public works and dealer of motorways.
The town hall of the city wants to be able to end 2014.
After choosing collaboration public / private (PPP initials in French) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local government has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction of the operation of the toll.
In anticipation of the presentation of their bid in May, the planned investment totalled 700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 millions euros) and three consortia in the last phase clash, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the greatest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European experts in underground work.
Against the team of Acciona, pack the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British firm Laing O'Rourke, of the Australian manager of Transfield infrastructure and manufacturer's group French Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is divided between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which states in its turn to the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises of major construction projects and privatizations, but enter represents a great challenge, except by means of acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the Hochtief companies and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS was just to win a place on the market by his participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Active millionaires
Acciona on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it has a large presence through the intermediary of its activity of supplier of energy and in the area of the desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and conducts business on building and managing the dessalinisateur grouping of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 000.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.
The underground route toll, promoted by the Office of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and that Northern Link (link north), is called upon to link the western way of Toowong highway peripheral to Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 kilometers of tunnel. it is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be opened to traffic late 2014, it is not envisaged that the site be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be developed in 2005.
It will include two times two lanes, an electronic system of tolls and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane offers to work Hochtief
Australia continues largely to build Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday the achievement of a contract with the government valued at 154.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through the intermediary of its local subsidiary Leighton, the national network infrastructure broadband fibre optics.
This intervention will enable 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has assigned the project for construction of the tower King George, of 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. the work has not yet begun and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment of 75 million euros.
FCC is adjudiquer a tunnel in Slovenia for 64

A fine of $63 to France Telecom to curb competition
The regulator of the French competition imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by the signing of exclusive agreements, from tariffs and by programmes of loyalty to the consumers in conjunction with the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French and even business monopolies and accumulate more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority which ensures competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and it is therefore a repeat offender.
A shop of applications
On the other hand, the mobile telephone subsidiary of the French company followed the wake of other operators and opened a shop of Internet applications, designed to increase revenues that do not come from the transmission of voice.
Initially, the shop of Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 to Real Madrid and +36 since its establishment
The League of Champions became a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won 467,4 third and fifth clubs that have earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is on top of the list.
Manchester United is on top of the list.
Winning the Champions League of UEFA does not only the glory; it is also about one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362.5 millions of euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the inception of the tournament, in the course of the season 1992-93, according to the information from UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have been well served in this division.
The white club was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one, with the AC Milan, has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, current taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
On top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern of Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have charged more money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in the +36.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in relation to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of the money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn $1.09 through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received $2.1 MILLION.
Furthermore, those who have been able to participate received 3.8 minutes only to be there, more than 550 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team. those arriving in eighths of final receive $3 each, the eight teams arriving in a quarter-final reçoivent3, 3.
The last four teams will each receive.
And the champion will win 9, faced with the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, under the fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1, and up to 31.2 millions.
On the other hand, the +36 picked up 2.5 millions for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are enshrined 337.8 millions.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and disposes of four seats, characters.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the latter, 20% in the third and 10% in the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played in the course of the edition of the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offer 61 million euros to 29.9% of France.
The group Nueva Rumasa outlined yesterday the details of the offer of stock by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of France.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and who will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday, the shares of France finished to 1.85 euros; the supply of Nueva Rumasa thus 18 percent below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real assessment of France.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The group of Jerez gives a period of 15 days for shareholders indicated their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV assured not having been informed of the offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateos claimed that she had made contact with the regulator.
If it occurred, the disbursement would amount to 611,7 millions, as the capital of France is to 254,27.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of its leadership.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible bids and swaying judicial of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Maria Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision is the first woman to hold a leading position in the food company.
It is a newly created position that will depend directly from the president of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged misuse of more than 230 million Sos to corporate Salazar.
Indeed, the possibility that in the next few months Sos reveals new diversion of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega (representatives of the Mac and Unicaja) said yesterday before the High Court that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 millions without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA of exclusion by Inversora Sea Paternina
The National Commission market values (CNMV) approved yesterday the OPA exclusion made by Inversora Sea on Federico Paternina on 9 October.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, motor garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have undergone a disaster are brought up to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and the time of labour can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the hand the cost of a repair included between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The suppliers of services and of solutions for the assessment of disasters and maintenance are devoted to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then treat and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, Solera North American Group, is the business leader; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and of the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex commercial director, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each provides information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, so that over the past five years, more than versions, variants and motors were launched in the past fifteen years.
When a new car lot on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very difficult work, because it is cataloguing each thousand pieces of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image Intelligent of each model on which we can click on various parts of a passenger car.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If a car soon sold, it can take three or four months. currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have such information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
Regarding the vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds the 99%.
To do the work of literature and development of databases, Audatex disposes of eight centres spread across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
Here, more than 100 technicians (in general engineering experts working simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests annually 90 to develop these data bases.
Each month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give their different uses and to propose various products.
The most frequent application repair and maintenance, but countries, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or to calculate the monetary or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that includes information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex not proposed in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support it may provide for professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, AudaPlus as the flagship product, the standard solution evaluation losses for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account estimates of repair time by the manufacturer or the scales of paint.
This tool is bought in terms of its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for customers who use little, maximum ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which makes thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and of the equipment with which it came out of the chain of assembly, only through its number of chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas opened a server to the professional sector Internet-based bidding on car wrecks.
His department of statistics is very useful to identify trends, achieve the common problems demographic or know analyses by brand and model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of confusion went to the garage for a breakdown or how many had suffered serious losses in a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official documents, prices and times of the manufacturer.
GT Motive is a Einsa group company, founded in 1971, as a service provider and Disaster Assessment solutions, car failures or maintenance.
The GT guide assessment is a historical reference product on the market.
The company is working with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased the rate of 20 percent per year during the last three years, and it has made a turnover of 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.

Since 2007, it is adjacent to the New York stock exchange and is part of the core CPI Standard & Poor's.
Internet auction of rugged cars
Last October, the group Solera bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, on motorbikes and Special Vehicle evacuees.
The operation involved a cost of 59.5 billion for 85% of the capital of the company, which could be expanded to the remaining 15 percent the next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more service value to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This service is intended exclusively for estimation and sales, such as insurance companies, industry professional experts, leasing companies, garages, the scrapyard and vendors that must be registered before starting to conduct operations.
The platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
One of its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
It is now more than 1,500 vendors and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new advertisements are published every day.
Under the Spanish law, a car with the number of chassis was withdrawn cannot circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex approaches.
In four stages of garage estimate
With the Auda tool - Taller, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quotation in only four steps: identify the vehicle, seek the replacement piece, create a quotation and generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, in varying degrees, are reluctant to the use of new techniques of management.
The database includes 1,034, including 666 of tourism, 109 ATVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and a connection to the Internet are necessary.
Once the model to compensate identified through its number of frames, a real graphic image of the model in question appears then selects the necessary piece.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, increases or reductions, then it can print the estimate for handing it to the customer.
AudaTaller AudaPlus as estimation is not a tool, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that software for garages does not include the time of labor estimated.
The cost of use of this tool for the garage of 350 euros per year, which may be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics have a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and to turn to see the inner.
