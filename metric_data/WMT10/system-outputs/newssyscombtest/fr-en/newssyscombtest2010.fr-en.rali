The lack of snow in mountain bothers hoteliers
The deserted runway is not a problem that lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions.
It is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and the New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users roam the tender, asking prices, but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if we call, they request immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book.
If we give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation is then, so we can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel will offer Špindler for the moment that stays a week for the New Year.
I think they will try to continue a time of the place, but they also cèderont and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes yet beds of free for all periods of winter.
The Christmas week us most of the time, it is not completely sold.
It is still free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few last-minute Christmas stays cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí 's tourism agency may also propose the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The 14 days of February go well, the remaining winter stays are moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
People expect that it is set to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the runways overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We have for the last few places for Christmas and New Year.
There is great interest during the holidays in January of Polish and February is selling well too, "said Karel Rada, Director of the best hotel Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the car park is also central to complete Lázně Jánské 80 percent during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent Jánské Hotel Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at present.
February is slightly lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the certainly become even more Krkonoše said the Director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday, it will be more cost and if there is precipitation, they should be snow in mountain.
But by then, the time should be warm, informed Jiří Jakubský of the station of Hradec of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comique, the diligence with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered himself as simple.
When it has come to be expected so much sweat its doctrine, it turned out that he had recopiée in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario Bush of three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as part of its own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in a new Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who was commander of the recommendations of the campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left his successor a final situation much more favourable than we would have hoped.
Barack Obama hoped that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It is again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House in spite of subordination habits.
It asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option, at least he had defrauded the General of 10,000 soldiers.
It has managed to pull the promise of 5,000 extra the part of Europe, even if it were on 10 000 originally.
This causes the most problems throughout the Obama strategy appears to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and complete the whole process within three years. The entire doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
In spite of fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change overnight leader, depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain just window-dressing behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Iranian and Pakistani influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy makes perplexed by his resoluteness.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantique and out of the reality can be confident that the small soldiers sent in the tumulte of the war for "prompt return to the house" will bring is a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see this as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians cannot do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that sanctions strengthened have no impact on the Iranian, the US will be faced with the difficult question of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for that it is working on a new strategy, in case it would prove to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash
Employees senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The Group of 30 leaders main will receive shares instead of cash, they cannot resell within five years.
The actions can be withdrawn to the leaders if they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, and Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link the pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense that it should take, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan society
The concern is in the details, "he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $ 17 billion for premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $ 20 billion despite the announcement today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday it would affect a single tax of 50 percent the bankers' bonuses exceeding 25.000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all areas apart from the physical
These are five women, a record number, which have received today in Stockholm hands of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
Two U.S. biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The price of chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have clarified the structure and function of the ribosome
The last winner received the Nobel laureate, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been winner this year has been the physical.
This award was presented today scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres avecWillard Boyle and George Smith for their invention of CCD chips, which are at the basis of all digital cameras, fax or telescopes.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reached 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (Approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the rewards them.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to US President Barack Obama.
This, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since it is only at the beginning of the route and that it is in addition to the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy he added that in some cases the war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited the Château
President Vaclav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the firm Janota's position will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the crisis of public finances.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who has informed the meeting.
Janota will then discuss his office Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday, the proposals of the left for transfers of money and increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed social democrats proposals to the fact that they would increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right of the other, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the Green Party and the ČSSD.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the savings package passed by the government of Fischer and that it should contain the indebtedness of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the Law on the State budget but that nothing requires, said today at a breakfast discussion with contractors, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "disability irréfrénable" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution favourable.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could be based on a consensus of broader political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is appalling and that the government should call into question its existence later.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a firm administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer called verdicts such words of "drastic".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday, already, the successful ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by South African American, the players say the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will explain to the world a lot on the country, his battles and victories.
The story spoke of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
U.S. actor Morgan Freeman, rewarded for Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged years who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: "If I must embody, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor aged years who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery, slave itself become a shadow of the US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and also important for both people as Mandela.
The South African State ex-homme has been imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaincu and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak with him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela resteencore and knows that his country still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
It is sure to unite his people by sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on a large screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the closest to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shakes hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the master of a national rugby team, in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar to his home was a surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I seem much more in the film ".
Despite the differences between the players and the actual models Invictus, under the leadership of the director Eastwood received positive opinion and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The criticism of films Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarized his assessment in these words: "It is a very good story, a very well done film."
In the assessments of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive feedback.
The mystery of the will in Norway is committed: The Russian tested a rocket
It was observed a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch has, however, been a failure and the "type" Bulava missile, which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the Russian army becomes progressively the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Repeated his presence at the tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava missile" as "not flying"
A missile that do not steal but shining
The 13th test took place early normally.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was again the damage to equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" is soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving boat submerged and
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely has likely been by a Bulava "defective".
The rest, the Norwegian have not doubted a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot talk absolutely failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the experienced engine failure on the first floor.
Even if no test launches has gone smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence said that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
The success rate of almost 1 percent fills the general optimism and they say, therefore, always a day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear nuclei hypersonic a total weight of 15. tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov to 51 years has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The defender legendary Viatcheslav Fetissov will return in a professional game in 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will assist his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà at the game on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career with 40 years in 1998, is currently the Chair of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov train regularly and agreed to help the team.
We must still resolve some details on the form, said the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the agency AP.
It was not clear whether the comeback of legendary hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, "said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov became the Russian professional hockey player the oldest.
In NHL, the legendary attacking Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the plant Hyundai of Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the plant Hyundai has confirmed.
However, the company wants to be yet agreement with unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our plan of production, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime were proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, "said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company has proposed a Koruna 400 bonus to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
He will be assigned to the day ex-post also worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Or they receive the supplement for hours in more, or they may be a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their holiday aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime were the most urgent issue and the warmest in the comments and the claims of trade unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions are cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between management and the unions car plant to be held on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state of strike in case of agreement on their claims and signature of a joint document.
The situation in the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees started spontaneously on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor pay and conditions of alleged hazing.
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work in a supplement to meet requirements of production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions have also requested that the employees who have ceased production are subjected to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a payment of 5 000 SEK (209 €) for them.
Hyundai of Nošovice the car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
She has produced about 80.000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: A substance that operates on the HIV virus "endurants" also
A team of scientists Czech and German tests of new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the virus that have already developed immunity to drugs.
The reality is, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination is not as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
It may however radically extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Their consumption, however, result in a series of side effects.
In addition the suppression of this increase was in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have more effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with HIV resistance.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes is an assemblage of boron carbon, hydrogen, and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of leads researchers to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the virus proteins.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: Two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon atom and connected by a metal, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease birth there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If people stop HIV protease, it will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, researchers explained in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations of two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the proteases of HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical drugs, however it is not wavering on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore to consider more interesting combinations to move towards the development of drugs effective against HIV, "says Pavlína Řezáčová, Director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The President of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the words of ODS of drastic verdict.
It said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly more.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his post with the assistance of the Parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed amendments to the tune of SEK 12 billion included by the left.
The House has increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government and that a revised budget is a variant less bad than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still think about the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after passing the Government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in office.
His disappointment about the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, which imposed changes of the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the Head of Government Fischer and across the government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing detrimental, said in a statement Topolánek text from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments embraced TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in response to fight against the amount of the deficit in the public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of Democrats.
I did not thought through and once it is on the agenda when I do spend, "said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to government precisely by Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer took off in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not expressly asked Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticisms from the chair of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of everything that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains on the same charges.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains regional or less responsible and will strengthen rather others.
The full coverage of transport will decline to date of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rate and the reduced rate.
Examples are the inhabitants of the Ostrava region that will have more links to the capital, the railways will add a block pendolino.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be dramatically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest drop in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, however Prague and its environs can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will only a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, you can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: At the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line Esko commuter system, including the opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines between Prague and HC Pendolino trains Ostrava and destination of Šumperk/Jeseník partiront by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up in Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year to regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kroner loss to resolve the visible, is the same amount that this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in height of nearly three billion.
This year, 200 million regional trains are more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for 10 years, until now the duration was always a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only the tickets a day ČD Net and the Internet at a reduced price tickets eLiška.
For travellers without reduction card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of new eLiška will depend on the path, whereas previously it was valid between the cities of a region in the choice and was a single tariff of 160 crowns.

The history of South Africa to everyone, according to Morgan Freeman as Mandela
The new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood arrives in the U.S. rooms in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus narrae: Neporažený), and a part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid globally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
The full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa, from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes because it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are faced with disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the new film reactions are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using its own terms, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we have the possibility to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but he added for each individual.
Wear the jersey national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the jersey of the national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa won then.
To be shown on the lawn in swimsuits, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long championed fourteen years ago primarily of white audience and has been recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the football championship will be able to unite people again in a single nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen if the situation of South Africa tense will improve.
South African whites are however sceptical as the recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the correct figure may be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed will be replaced by a nine.
She added that in 10 years of operation, the company Čeps had known nothing of similar and that such incidents are isolated.
The electricity supply have not been interrupted, said the spokesman for the ČEZ society Northern Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry has not been influenced by the fire station's transformation.

Jančura will lodge a complaint for slander against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today defamation complaint against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Ratko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
It was indicated in Dvacet Jančura minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions, however, have come to sign long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three were attacked and say that it is fine mouths, while it was only made an offer for themselves what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange of slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura in Radiožurnál.
He also claimed to have evidence that no region has taken in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for this a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint of Mr. Jančura is the result of a media spectacle that it is free publicity for its society and to the person.
I am of course ready to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other reeves to do likewise.
I assume that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who manipulate public opinion and used false arguments and lying about regional rail transport, said Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million crowns in a negative advertising that included the approaches of the regions.
It said that it will stop the Radiožurnál campaign after Christmas and that it has the resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura has launched his campaign after the regions agreed to give the Czech Railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion crowns, without tender issue.
According to Jančura, a way to act is unlawful and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a Member of ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it did not stop, you could lose our bus licences.
It was presented as a Member of ČSSD, I do not know who they are, but I will not say his name, "said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The pneumococcal vaccination will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccination will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
The voices already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccination against the free peaked.
The pharmaceutical Institute already defined maximum prices for vaccines that will pay for the insurance.
Experts are also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal bacteria.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the vaccination began last year or earlier, it will have to pay yourself the following vaccination.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3th and the 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal bacteria.
Yet the parents were paying SEK 1600 or more for a dose.
The vaccination of more young requires four doses.
Analysts believe that each year the insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on health care that would require unvaccinated children.
So far the State was spending approximately SEK 500 000 per year for any vaccination of children.
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumococcal are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infection and inflammation of the lining of the blood poisoning.
According to investigations in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
Vaccination will be compulsory?
There is advice on a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference on which our association participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not change the process of the pneumococcal vaccination.
We are looking not at this time, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Society specialist paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
The pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is financed by the insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová said that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they would save on potential future and medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is, however, linked to concerns of pediatricians practitioners, relating to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors the receiving the same way that other vaccine products provided by the State.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance "deduct amounts of health insurance."
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them.
According to estimates, the pediatricians will individually invest nearly 40 000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Always them and we
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger b at Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), a study élégante and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a much wider fabric and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutions that provide now in France this queM. Bozen called "spaces" for the Muslim 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim to marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
The evolution and gay rights should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern, secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled by the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a key values "narrow".
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The view the world's darkest
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and new fisheries sail in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Who knows the history and complicated political of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 who had to fight that the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a show celebrates brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult freedom. the climate is rarely mentioned: A polar bear living in Singapore has become green because algae grown in his thick fur.
Click here for more information.
Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters in helicopter Indian and Inuit fusilsd' motoski use of powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northerly waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain as long.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear summary and frightening Arctic science and a fascinating overview of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the oceanographers can relate with accuracy the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the polar ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes of relief sous-celle-ci.
Surveillance satellites and the probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson at the tiny and special world of the system dependent on Arctic ice, formed by the brackish water nets pressed by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, all will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, this may be our turn"
The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class De Angello Robinson, 19, has taken a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina Cemetery in Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to pay tribute to the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we are likely to be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If I could, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, so I am trying just to show respect.
It was one of the 6 000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the Arlington cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester were also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Des wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, the volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the founding Walmart Foundation gave more than $ 150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that it had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that may be civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflée in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills expanses of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen, old graves dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimism, while the children played and couples were held by the hand, bringing fresh pine wreaths grey on the graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small knot red butterfly on the top.
Nearby, were silent on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1 000 crowns to decorate the section but the sour mood of the current wars de-water the area.
People were crying without hiding, other prayed and families and friends is supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others turned to see small black and white information cards, stuck in the wetland for those whose falls had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had led eight hours to come to collect on the grave of Sergeant Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, died in combat in July.
No one should never forget through what we are free... my son has paid for it, "she said.
"Long after I've gone, I want someone remembered him."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who disseminated mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs American.
The national, who has not been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to access the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges were not made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All activities, including protests revolutionary so-called moderate and critical writing, lead to the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti-gouvernementaux and the speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, conducted by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who writes often about how are husband and she are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft approach" to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States can give back.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although new consumer goods and desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $ 15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or to a 15-minute conversation which corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans wishing to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "said Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said that it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be permitted - distributing free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report severe on the freedoms in Cuba, called" New Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, been tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a conspiracy to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that the case would dismantle an extensive network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet in search of young men radicalised.
Investigators said they hunted a hidden insurgente personality, known under the name Saifullah, who invited the men in Pakistan after they discovered when one of them has made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains prohibited northeast become a haven for terrorism.
They have been treated as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the matter.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and they were always trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry in the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men - who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI - insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who put its trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services had been infiltrating priority for men in the al-Qaeda network.
Corporate recruiters play the role of firewall, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
Analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also be more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept as the US secret services have become experts in regard to their methods of recruitment.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? Said Kohlmann.
The model is that more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for a "action" to the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the climate of the negotiators working in the conference hall Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25 000 according to estimates of the police.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists had lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little has happened during the discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'It is no planet B "and a Spanish, saying" The Land said that it has enough. "
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the birthplace of his mother, Peru, opened his eyes to the painful problems facing the country because of the impact of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march - to spread the word and appeal to leaders around the world to take decisions fair, ambitious and engaged, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too near the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too near the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in discussions on climate, activists who wore black clothing and masks, started several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
They launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed later by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to keep walking, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators were not able to revive the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on the international discussion, he replied in English "In fact, it is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside".
He noted that the process could be harmful or useful in the prospects.
It shows the interest of the public and of different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they affect the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has made a good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in far greater progress over the previous two years that in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Evaluation of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African American and white on the plans, both local and national.
The results means of white children of Grade 4 (cc) to WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years, from 1 to 262 (on a scale of 270), but those of their classmates African American increased by only three points from 500 to 209.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling just one point from 245 to 244.
The result means of white was not included in the test results because the sample was not enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (cc), where the first District NAEP report was published, was 1 points (60 to 262).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed the concern that the increase observed by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But the fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for schoolchildren classes of end of elementary education and early college who have not incorporated the foundations of the reading earlier in their school career and which are relatively late compared to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics curriculum for grades Kindergarten (kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, such as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited to the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better services to these students below the level of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California, Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may have repercussions policies that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendent of Schools, it is trying to use the middle class of black and white.
We focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success is traditional public school time, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with the Charter schools.
It must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, it considers a "starting point" for even an increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise for the future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, in a time of falls and cligne eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and rolling lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, as she and other students from Grade 8 (4th) Group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $ 38,690 a year, his attitude was less than that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super This is where I will study! Exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide the heading towards the entrance of the building of science.
Really? "She says songeuse, Youpi, when it told him the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children during their voyage of discovery of three days and now, they were fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely to the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the" second generation "on his studies at the Lycée cinqpoursuit - a notable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they open the way to following generations will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers studying the wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and finding ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university - in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, do not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network to these children from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program which funded the visit universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (are planning you), it provides more than $ 300 million a year to local school systems to organize the preparation programs that begin when the university students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the years of high school.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil obtained agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry, Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have been awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of European and Asian companies are leading the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take some time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday and political instability, while the U.S. military troops withdraw US oil companies have slowed, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and brought their technical advice, are left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more outbidding on contracts that other companies and left with significant shareholdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Default companies to submit bid auctions that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda's operations, this week, U.S. authorities said Friday the counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, within the Pakistan's lawless tribal border.
They drove a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilians secret services, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority said that local activists suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely shredded".
It was totally impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. counter-terrorism officials have given evidence not specified that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the main military organizers who ran the al-Qaeda terrorist operations group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots in the world, said one of the authorities, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this was probably of conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic guidance and the leaders of al-Qaeda has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida' 's and had good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but this does not diminish the threat it is for us and our allies, "said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six per month to two operations, according to the figures put forward by the Long War Journal Web site, a moderate by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing suspected informants also ruthlessly, says the site.
The UN envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extent during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
United Nations envoy said that he supported the increase but it has expressed its concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of U.S. troops who would start in 18 months and that would require other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that it did not resign but that it would comply with just the commitment it had made to his family in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that it was time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start to seek my alternate, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, to promote President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the charges of Galbraith - who was thanked - "have prejudiced the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of éléctions".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the Heads of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I was unable to recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it may not last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300, American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of ¨ such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians of the street.
He said that "a set of incentives and punishments" may be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it is actually in less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly 'of these sanctions.
In a statement issued on Friday, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face the consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, desperately needed in exchange for fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, means of developing a confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be away from attempts to agreement - in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the commitments or not with the United States.
Frankly, I think the stiffening of Iran to address some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish oil rich region derencontrer to the Heads of troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm anxiety of Kurds on the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will keep your safety, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not let you down. "
In China, a change of direction aging
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by preaching to the propaganda poster, "The Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby as well, it is a grave in more".
They have so learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; the response has been instantaneous and firm: Never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, age 31, Director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique well with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the coastal rich cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is on the point of becoming "as old - but not as rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive reduction
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one child policy is to this day, without question, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who break this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced a second child pregnant women to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one child policy.
In 2004, they have been more exceptions to the rule - including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already children unique - and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute for Research on the population), at Peking University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The Government of the city sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He also promised to provide financial and psychological advice for those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wishing to a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, there is always that four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 - slightly more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, have said they would dearly love to have two children and they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that the one child policy is a rights issue, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we flew the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she did not want a single child because it was a itself. "We were the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares."
We are not used to take care of someone else and we do not really want to take care of the other. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translation the said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which are down the birth rate, he said, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents struggle in the early days of the capitalist China and do not want to have themselves this way of life, "he says.
Even one child time-consuming parent, "he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of social life.
Then there are the problems of space - "There you must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has proposed plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations - characterized to date by assignments disorganized and mutual recriminations - is back in the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the next time.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as much as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step in negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand the global warming, course and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and the new emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt àWashington, Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what the Secretary-General described Executive on climate change to the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture."
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce them by 15 percent to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent in 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $ 3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative to the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion that the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration it was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, which also regretted that the text does not focus enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern has made his comments a day after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei has said that the US chief negotiator, was "common sense", was "highly irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not financially China to combat climate change.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects are found both within and between the world of the Third World industrial and emerging economies.
The current battle for more rescue individual savings that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States is querellant on their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist that the two dozen countries ignore the most influential scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also on Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a treaty proposal of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has "put political pressure on the political process complete", in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister of China took their aircraft and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The real image of the assembly - in which 13,000 people come into and out of the Palais des Congrès each day - activists guitar players are nocturnal entertainment mocking countries that they betray, and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by e-mail - is a real challenge.
The intensity is more important: Almost all Ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of major, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for policy World Conservation International.
The lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday
At 5: 13 p.m., Monday morning, a whistle percera the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train the country will reach 225 km/h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations, North and Midlands from Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become commuter towns, the successful business travel times will be much less long and the portion of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce the national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of dangers to the environment can dampen the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
It will provide a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to be established in the West Midlands five metres of the urban areas and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high-speed network larger, towards the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another going to the northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option 'said a professional performance of rail.
When it is completed, the journey times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train travelling at 400km/h, making it the fastest British network in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project is to be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built part by party.
The trains will first have to roll out high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, retaining the journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This appears to be the best to ensure a pass to trains, planes as a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of 75.000 GBP for the orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, a key member of parliament Tory, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a orangerie that it has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for having complained that members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its borrowing of 75.000 GBP to build an extension oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interests, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received complaints at the time and had not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who is a member of the spending control. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer and simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
Neighbouring houses were sold for nearly £million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, the describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
Neighbours described it as a front porch "for fun".
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give explanations for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of the Commons standards and privileges, prior loans on its provisions.
The Committee has cleared last month of any charge of breach of the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal certainty of the loan of 271.406 GBP to his London property in his constituency home he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1.400 GBP per month of interest to borrow up to March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1.800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the debt of 75.000 GBP.
The RBS standard variable interest rate increased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1.250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as Head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in coverage was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament should survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" e "of the m...
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could ask darn well, but I did not. "
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist was dug a hole in the form of GBP in the lawn of M Duncan, in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4.000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements in both capitals, approved by the fees office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of escape or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, you all see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an Advent calendar, interactive.
Beyond, a group that encourages alternative church spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17.30 to 18.30, each day, with wine and hot pies served free of charge.
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange? It seems to me that the Church should be closer to the people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of Advent calendar of the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with some friends, over dinner.
Brighton is a vibrant and creative and place if we try to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Late payment: Anger prison guards, planned actions
The prison guards unions have called Friday to the "general mobilization" to require the payment by the Christmas bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
Supervisors union FO-pénitentiaire (2th) asked the staff who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning to prisons and the "block", to "denounce the flight of their due."
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3th union of the profession) the calls to "meet in general meetings in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", saying "shameful and unacceptable" failure "payment in December of overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the prison autonomous federal Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls on the general mobilization (...) to raise the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Service and the Department of Justice explained that overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions their supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writing the Minister of Justice in the mail.
I have asked prison administration put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation due to an erroneous assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, "said Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal leadership with the notorious bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary constraints have good back."
It is a pure scandal, was incensed the FO interregional union of Marseille, in announcing his decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and invitations".
Staff will not work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when it increases our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less well off than others.
But in any case the account is not, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

I called for the abandonment charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, the judge Rittenband - died since - would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison - which is a serious lack of procedure.

It is very strong, it is going very well, "said to the press David Hallyday off the plane to fly him to Paris shortly after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT).
The son of singer, relaxed air, provided that it would be "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a slipped disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and be able to administer its treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a slipped disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to be réopéré in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of serious damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning in Los Angeles where French lycée is educated their daughter Jade, to attend a school performance, found an AFP photographer.
The chief of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that it would be Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the park international Monceau Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, "said Mr. Camus.
I have heard about a possible future legal procedure, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday party was "much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon in Paris".
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, given that I had myself two discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the art world.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where it was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse, repeatedly condemned by justice, in medical liability issues, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of Doctors, was accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday, through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
It said that the intervention was "seamless" and that the post-operative tests were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and would not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased in this summer, appears in brackets.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF tone and increase the amount the New Centre not to use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the takeover attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former giscardien, highlighting the remains of no longer use on any support, under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF acronym as François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past the NC), which claims ownership of the mark UDF for being the first to the file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not wish to be deprived, walked out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, the demanding not to use the acronym and transmit the ownership of the mark, under threat of prosecution.
You have multiplied, these days, the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem party, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist Alliance.
You also decided to follow up on your equipment and activist on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the New Center + + +, the slogan the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the office of the UDF that is the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) website".
It also calls to Mr Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of (the) mark in its legitimate rights holders".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" of the leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Center did so, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem party for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the moral and material interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when it filed the mark", it was "more UDF member of the past three years", but to the UMP.
It is shockingly and fraudulently in the absence of filing of the UDF acronym for the conduct on its behalf.
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, before ironiser on the strategy of NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for themselves than to try to break the anonymity in taking a false name who was not right".

This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter clashed while taking the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be conducted together three doctors.
The heir and a major shareholder in L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors nominated Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt said could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I'm going to talk about it, "said outside the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is an excellent new (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal charges against the photographer François-Marie Banier and journeyman entertainer, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother for a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of masters.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, it considers a long time friend.
While the court should consider the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned to the general unpacking family Friday.
Thus, counsel Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said beware of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer added: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre was again suggested that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a juvenile judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the department's representative public, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided it would once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of big French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence will be pointless...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of big business vis-à-vis its employees, said the business position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: It is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by technicians of the plant.
With the client at the heart of the company, the revolution has provided the marketing strategies of conquest of markets to the location... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors regularly return preferences of clientèles!
A demobilization of employees may lead to a demoralization deadly desires.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much wider phenomenon that affects in particular the frameworks.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R & D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the authoritarian management revenue blocked completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the client.
The utility any opinion surveys on the internal
The internal opinion surveys as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I think not.
- First because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure is finally, after many detours, priority... what it has always done.!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism - pathologies of pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory, reactivated recently by the American "neuroscience-related" American and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of education and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of managers, a recent survey published in The Figaro.fr Ipsos conforte-t-elle leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, inappropriate in the world today.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, means to adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: For employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motives of the employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their business based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and submit their management of human resources "to the place".
They create a favourable climate and the joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo discourse: The "just war" is right to praise Obama
The American right welcomed Friday, the speech the previous day in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé the awards to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party, the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists all there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the President had done at Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this speech definitely history, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed for the radio program" The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he is delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free, and they could put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
Pen for Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush used a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a speech very American".
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as it always does, "" he spoke as an American president ", recalling the Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do little to the preserve ", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a faucon of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech "dull, purple and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
To the left of the President, the Democrat Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war envelope in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press remained however flattering to the location of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called the speech "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo discourse "should serve as a road map to guide decisions against the international conflict, poverty and oppression", has ignited the California daily.
Mr. Obama "delivered the speech that he was", said the New York Times, the ruling "both dark and building".
Road: Three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of marathon negotiation process, the road sector unions and employers' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday night to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, launched on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in late morning the text of the agreement.
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours a meeting began at 11H00 so that everyone agrees and in 18H00 the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that it will disrupt the holidays for years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a salary increase of 4% for the lowest salaries in the road transport (local and regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for the low-wage, "it is EUR 8.72 to 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
This is it will give the order to our activists that there is no blockages, no embargo centres of supplies.
But there may still be some recalcitrant who are not happy, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the high salaries given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the understanding of common sense and respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed" a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has in turn referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will help to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' contributions" was the subject of a Government amendment to the bill amending finance for 2009, voted in Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate vote "in terms of the same".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies initially businesses adherent to the organization, and in a second time, for the entire profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations may only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a "fool", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised the sector to offset some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport required us to negotiate in the? Emergency, not in conclusion d? A shared analysis, but not to antagonize the turkey eaters of the next Unostra, deplored the Eve.
For the Otre, the agreement risk "of digging the grave d? A very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals for the AAPN
The disruption on the RER A, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday, the 2th day of strike between unions and management of the AAPN left them on their hunger for their application of premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains that between 10.00 and 20.00, for a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who are expecting 200.000 clients each day, welcomed the fact that "the AAPN make efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris conurbation.
The section AAPN short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre at Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak hours, and virtually no consist in off-peak hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there has been no crowds on the docks, the Franciliens is being held.
And in the morning, the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than normal, especially because of the absence of collégiens and lycéens.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29 years of engineer, explained to be lifted "one hour 30 earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time."
The Gare Saint-Lazare has not been saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and police.
The RER A made by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left of the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, considered "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, Career Path etc.
This is not what want drivers, who are calling for a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The AAPN is even its proposals of premium in brackets, was incensed the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not fichue to resolve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is made".
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said AAPN.
This was also say the unions that the company "made fun of users over the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that management, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in an effort to restore calm" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The trade unions demand a premium of € 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150 and EUR 30 variables (CGT, CFDT, FO, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line in million daily passengers.
Drivers of PRRs, all in the second part of career, affect 2.200 to 2.700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said to the press, the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously of 11 judges, while a qualified majority of 37 votes was required to give the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that party officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the immunity enjoyed Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk by the Treasury and the confiscation of assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (in 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP to obey "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy PKK rebels.
The party is, however, that there was "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stop the PKK Kurdish support and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
After the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered at the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast populated by majority Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and water cannons, used when demonstrators threw stones and molotov cocktails, with slingshots.
About people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (ndlr) in Kurdish, prohibiting a party, "he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not resolve, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the Government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Verwaltungs-.
We can expect, of course, a reaction of the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of city Western off-limits to visitors secret.
Ten Zelenograd, a Moscow district, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research secret weapons under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants to 37 km in central Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Soviet" Silicon Valley.
Important places of production and of micro- and nanoelectronics research are located.
As early as September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science francfortois - with the academic institutions, and corporations in the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been meetings last Wednesday of each other and representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd to the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Section Head project to Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, partiront to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will allow companies to enter the FIZ growing Russian market.
Unlike the Russian scientific societies to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of institutes and famous Soviet research companies.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as "planned" to the Socialist city weapons research.
Zelenograd City (literal translation "green") gets its name from the forested hills at the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: A brake for Stuttgart
We cannot place high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
For his supporters this is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21, is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a huge construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, despairing of sites in chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 80s.
The stations, with head end ending routes in the city, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the art of the th century transport were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a long time to get the locomotive of the back to the front.
Arrival, stop short, start - that is what needs to be done.
That is why the head end stations must disappear: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: A train crossing station, located about halfway on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne of the rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava of where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was prohibitive.
Indeed, the head of line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However, it is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new line inter-city in Ulm.
Regional and local policies prevailed.
The railway company is in part because it is the taxpayer that is the cost of the risks of the biggest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
Urban's point of view this project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban area - according to the computer-generated graphics planners - will be very green.
For the railway system the S21 is bad.
The station of transition and enlargement of the section are designed for a trafficking which were assigned - and this is typical of the 80s - an enormous growth.
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic as the transport of goods by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, unsuitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the period.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade will this money for other junctions and congestion in the network.
The list of the Department of Transport mentioned in all 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 is the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament of Wisbaden, the Land Government raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the trail of aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport is completed.
The authority to attérir for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution.
The coalition must be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticism that period and attempts to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, this will be condidéré as a total failure to a promise.
It is darn hard to be allowed to take the floor, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir referring FDP éléctoral the slogan "We want our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch rejects the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel, which claims that the Land Government attempts to authorize when even the night flights using "of avocasserie and roublardises".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not take action on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
US banks repay aid
The large U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their relationship vis-à-vis the State.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid in full the Treasury $ 45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television network CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader of the regulation and higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital through the sale of shares to investors who had reported $ 19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the sum from the bank funds that are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank American taxpayers: The injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money in the capital markets to free themselves of the guardianship of the State.
The U.S. bank could launch as early as Thursday and a capital increase of $ 20 billion, CNBC reported the chain citing the banking community.
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the money they had received.
Accelerated Elections
Finally it is still spent faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding the post of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the Council of Administration dimethyldodecylamine of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin drafting of ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain, however, has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further undermine the steward of the ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration of five years to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender, but this was rejected.
Only 7 Council members had expressed support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The removal by vote of Brender represented a major setback while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, does not want to renew Brender to his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Ministre-Président of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed writer in Chief is extended by invoking the fact that the rate of listening to the news broadcasts of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law that had infringed on the debate and felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will be for nought.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 at Bingen.
He studied the sciences-politiques, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first to the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today).
Then his journey continues: From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor of the time; and corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then, and until 1998, he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (news programme bimensuelle presented the morning); until 2001 it was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF and head of the Berlin drafting.
After the disgrace of Brender, as he had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The adversary of Koch in the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant staff cannot be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to request the withdrawal of politicians members of committees to monitor the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the Council of Administration in criticizing the Committee strongly in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose to the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without being the soupconne to place as a political supporter.
Arithmetic in the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Clean-up in the university
Partial success for students: After a year of strike educational Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: At a meeting between Ministers and delegates to the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students Bachelor and Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are set to reduce the weight of reviews accordpour: A single review should close the module of study chosen.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée proportions to ensure "realistic and acceptable".
The political authorities and the institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organize more flexible common structural requirements for clusters of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should be no different rules of a Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly to the mouth the buzzword: "Étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical significance.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single review," can be read in a document of pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of accreditation said that by sharply reducing the burden of reviews it should be able to stop the blunders, which were significantly to the étudiabilité.
"Étudiabilité" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this smothering sensation that there is sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge on RAID in Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulation will affect access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles should be "re-certified" every 5 years, which means, however, that it was only in 2015 that all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on Accreditation Board created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that programs are not too loaded and the regime reviews not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized high schools have already heard with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to grant more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset programs strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of reviews and the service of international relations
The Länder and universities provide for this a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wishes to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this, there will be more move only one consideration to complete his studies.
The organization studies should be more flexible, more must be to ensure the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "étudiabilité" of all university cycles will be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but critics were heard.
The Federal President of the socialist student union has indicated that it would like the organization of education policy is more in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and presidents of universities.
No later than after the strike educational, students as people concerned should be able to speak a little.
The future Graduates of higher education it received the support of the President of the Conference of Presidents delegates (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Education Ministers of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and the opportunity for each bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller Steering Committee member of the GEW also requested that the Länder ensure students Bachelor of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder have to hire more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is a beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he dealt with in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, Director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Literary awards Söllner; in 1993 it took the Chair of the poetry sought-after Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is Director of the forum of literature of Hesse in the home of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
There has been much talk of him in circles not literary last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your records Securitate".
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate police policy.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The insidious enrolment trial began in 1971.
I am, therefore, concludes Söllner "someone who was not sufficiently able to withstand auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and his struggles literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the depths and the degradation of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securitate, MI Walter played a role, ensures the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter had interceded in favour.
"He was able to take all the difficult situations at the time," after Markel.
Markel moralde has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is, in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit ", having read the 914 pages of his own record.
It can be assumed that victims have made speculation and guessed what real names will sometimes hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike Germany where consultation between the time of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and stalled in the past.
It was only in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work in the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files instead dragged since.
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar, which, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed a very contemptuous towards the winner.
It was a psychosis, and in the end it had interviewed only once.
The infamy of power believed to speak here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many issues associated with the case Söllner are inevitable as happens so often in the context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Which has been evicted? The weighted response from listeners, to the admission of Söllner, give hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a desire to know that by charges and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Turmoil in the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived here, fired four pins from any right to a nice Christmas Day, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new coach BFV Christian Gross appeared at quarter to midnight in a Mercedes class C, that he had just called a supplier's orange plastic bag by hand.
The man, whose the bald skull drew attention, was driving in the city that he was still foreign.
Otherwise our -year-old itself could have taken the wheel - he did not drink alcohol and it was not drunk happiness.
He had spent an evening pleasant but tomorrow it had to return to work.
As it is now, that this would begin.
The words of Switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eighth of", that is to say in the league champions thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni in Romania "but we should not get carried away by the success. This will be a brutal battle not to fall".
The "great work" we expected Sunday.
Here, it is repeated in Mainz the results of the league champions on a daily basis.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals expeditious of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Raffle
The eighth final of the Champions League (game go 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry into service of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only in the moderate had brought luck, which was transmitted to professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a motivated and fun to play.
I have been see players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I told them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber" souls - Gross - the recipe for success that was if bienmais effects that was no longer with the trainer Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that you would never have thought possible".
Sami Khedira and that, after weeks of break to injury, advanced to the rank of the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "wind costs" and the method of work of the new leader: "It is someone who is taking action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation ".
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart has especially need tenacity.
As Gross, the players and the manager keep overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests roumains.
They had also won in Glasgow before they had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0: 4, Khedira objecta.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but they had other who were still far away.
We have not yet out of the woods yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday does not have the heart to the party, even after the first home victory for three months, is of the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, stymied Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under the pressure of pubertal fans.
Lehmann had considered also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the games he has been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann was marked by a "pure selfishness" Heldt ground and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, the strong and combative sports representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "largely in the success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in choir - and even the man in plastic bag obliged.
The world heavyweight championship
Hot combat in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement was the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve rounds difficult the Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the WBC version of the federation.
Unanimously of judges he imposed the points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The WBC federation announced that on the night of Saturday the champion of 38 years had won a victory on points against the judges' unaminité American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defended with honour its title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already twice won the title of world champion WBC and WBO federations.
Unfortunately it has not passed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, took out 39 times winner in 41, has the fighting professionals say twice its defeat because of injury.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat in 24 fights.
In the Berne Arène, before 17,000 spectators, the general Klitschko has especially wanted to dictate the fight, the top of its 2.02 metres, by its against left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller that, before the duel, announced the end of an era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of empéchant, and champion Klitschko to implicate his against right detrimental.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has primarily tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and deeds its assault not only rarely reached the champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000 have exceeded with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
The Klitschko the insulta on "dirty" zombie "is not really able".
During the weighing Friday, the champion has not been able to prevent cause Johnson to breaking down his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko has imposed again at its fourth combat since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he was beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "its" that he had the WBC belt before giving up without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez in Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of USA.
"I have just taken a blow in this fight and am in perfect form," said Klitschko to explain its rapid return on the ring.
Its rève is trying to bring in the family all four major titles.
His brother Wladimir is WBO and IBF champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who, with the general Nikolai Walujew détroné - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko to be held in September.
It would appear that his promotion company intends to play in this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case of Kunduz
Opposition frontal attack: The leader of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Ministry of Defence Guttenberg to lie in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and The Left parties (die Linke) request to the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After consideration of the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticised the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" deadly strike on the two tankers last September, said the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information the chain ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20).
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and that was read out by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was well to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the report of investigation of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air strike which was launched at the request of Colonel German military Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), take a decision as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Government's Afghan policy fédéralet if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved the new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The Chancery did not in any way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong doutesquant to express genuine reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack tank-trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details embarrassing.
In the entourage of two senior officials it suggests, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that" Wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received a response
Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on the allegations and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal Parliament would be the next Wednesday to render the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, any awake, images and hear voices that no one else seen nor heard.
It is not only for the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, all is well.
When we are elongated in our rooms clouded, we can do without obstacles to dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, the awake, experienced dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has quickly reputation in the Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in issue: It is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but sometimes that encourages the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best of cases this is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect interspecifically, visions of the mystique Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos for states, the shamans, the second of psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, brain neurotransmitter substances - first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the achétylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Hallucinations complex and delusional thoughts occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The land force of attraction has more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "great similarity between madness and the dream", to Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and sensory illusions that the composed".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turned into a cartoon character.
His body was in two dimensions to the garish colours.
The Land attraction has more power on him, it's a wave to the ceiling.
It is a fact.
Behind him winged creatures on earth, grimaçantes, the mouth bloodied, showing the teeth.
They continue, give it blows to the feet with heavy boots bold, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
The vote, howl, nasty, roaring out of walls and the radio.
He can't bear these voices and humiliate the insult.
Henning T. pulled out two cables of its stereo, in fact a loop and the attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It gets on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck.
It is.
The loop stands out.
That you should serve as a lesson, shout the voice in a chorus to extract the tympanum. "Is in a clinic and fais-toi treat!"
Today Henning T. was 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: Psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, furthermore it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
I lived in psychosis and terrible fears of deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population has at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, individuals can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, which means that they can suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, madness relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that controls, that comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned cannot distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
As the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of the conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, all to a service focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by the events and may not act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Experience a time in the life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on the fact the alienation of lived a place in a real framework.
Why our brain it such antics, is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose temporarily the perception of reality, Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins showed that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the brain neuronal maturation is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of neural system also occurs and the fact that it is not seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - the stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
This is crazy, "said Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the suffering of their hallucinations and psychotic take expensive drugs to undo while others buy drugs expensive to obtain it.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and the phenomena of images illusory: Last year he published its findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head."
The hallucinations are well part of concurrent phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
They include psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or the head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take form when the areas of the brain that deal with the sensory perceptions, are not enough hyperactives or refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, the stress, the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledges having made at least once in a lifetime experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years ago, she lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania earlier and it goes to school.
A girl just to make normal indeed.
If it was not the images and voices.
During recess, sometimes a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, to address the floor.
When she meets his comrades the watch, surprised - no one else seen nor heard the boy.
They believe that this is a shy girl dreaming lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
It is awake, heard and seen the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting beside her on the bench.
It may even see its presence temporarily.
It is a good feeling, it found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, asks it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are burdensome.
When it is in class, sometimes it can take the course because the teacher is just putting forward a new student in its eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly trying to explain equations in Table.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his room, it expected sleep that is too little and too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is awake or dream already, if the images that she sees, the faces grimaçants or rabbeted of the girl with blood on the arms and legs are before its eyes open or closed.
Let me Cree alone, it to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would take to a crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It had its ferry last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact with the internet psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or was not enough stimulation, the probability is high that it has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, ensures that there is animation.
Sarah K., only daughter was afraid of other children when she was small and often plays alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned in 13 years, that the man she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not the true father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the acoustic and visual hallucinations, and for the actual noise impressions and, therefore, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. "Each experience," according to Kasten "occurs in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, the night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, the person mentally healthy is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience was unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and Chief Medical Officer of the psychiatric clinic and hospital psychotherapy Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard form of experience has studied the so-called oniroïde, a particular form of the amendment of the conscience awake by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves, who are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is awake.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie, which fully aware, experience a paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a sustainable and total inability to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by its own fantasy world that is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world has held but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a severe form of means and interpretation, in a situation itself intolerable, organizational capacity that we are given, we men, not to sink into the none of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memory.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It was 49 years ago, when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; meanwhile, his body was sentenced to remain motionless on resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he fabricated, site visit, foreign travel in time. It is in bed old man in a sanatorium rail, a robot to his bedside care on his health.
He lived in the middle ages among the noble that manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is removed by a Greek bike that takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a névé of Korean mafia.
It is absorbed completely in this fantasy world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a state quite different, "he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from the extreme mental travel are a very detailed clarity and even years later.
We can say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this lived shattered the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, delusions, hallucinations and psychosis experiences psychedelics we show how our external reality domestic performances are fragile, even in a state of eve.
Any change in the status of conscience, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
In 27 years, the children will be the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: In the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that her two children are returning to the press group, he said to the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding must remain at 100 per cent a family business.
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit 27 years and are committed to mainstream society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years, the Spiegel.
All the details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the business will arise in the future.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose its children to 7500 staff without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, age 52, is a member of the Board of Administration since 1999.
At first, it was responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took over the Treasury sector is to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was also the head of the foreign sector, marketing, printing and Finance.
And for the first time this is not a member of the family that is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding must remain at 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have left lead by a boulimie of capital, which have made tremendous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could rise still higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never been rêvede, said Burda universal power.
I do not see myself in the role of the country as preceptor could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of the international leagues as the Time, these companies have taken much too important.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surfing the Internet.
It took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea is interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek provides a monthly subscription price and a very low, less than half the cost, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: One designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life, to six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited, but that its U.S. grand-frère is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately EUR 12, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means not to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the Wi-Fi (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and for a long time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon so that it does not have the Wi-Fi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without soup.
It is a device connected and we pay at its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: A purchase option with access to life as the Peek is already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The preferred colour of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the preferred colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has, in effect, chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: The award in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a model very similar in both occasions: In addition to their colour yellow tirant, a similar to the green with bright reflections, both times, the holding consisted of three parts: The dress, the jacket and the mantle, in the same tissues, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So that a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same held.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a thick lace, however, it was a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories also are different: Green footwear to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but gold, this time.
The cap it, too, has changed: Hair are now identified as it was released the last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers.
This shows the study "Fertility and professional career women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not, and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have a stable work shortly, are earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push the entry in the couple's life and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get, which led to the push the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence largely maternity, but less the date of early life together, "says the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that the gap of the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, more the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49, those with basic and higher education mothers were, respectively, for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another disctinction is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who made some elementary marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with studies of average level or higher reverse this program and give priority to achieving a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is well worth the

The poker to as Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) "X-radiography" writers who have crossed a literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not according to the genera predictable and apprehended (biographical information, life and work), but in seeking something similar to the nucleus of ignition of character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulsion, almost physical, one that I felt without the name: The pleasure against the fate looming, the moral without guilt and innocence no god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic allegorical, Christian, he wrote that he had in the blood, not in the head, between the powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, as the knife that threatened to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by the wife of a passion which lasted 13 years, in the flesh of which he conjugua the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a privilege spiritual which was to reach the sky on the road to perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight thousand metres summits of the universal literature, he must climb by the north face, on which the best climbers quit still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
Sometimes, he said himself that it was the heir of a County landowner and other times it was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of magnitude. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer is seeking the Cree denies pushed from a bridge by the character of Munch to bring its response to the bottom of the night of the th century, in its literary form, and he did it in the flight itself and on the remembered with a speech violate the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to knees and asked:" God, I implore you beloved to that I cease to write as a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were carved the to Spenser:" Sleep after the effort,/after the storm the port,/the rest after the war,/after life, tired death delights. "
On Virginia Wolf: "She was carrying in his luggage as its depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally she told that Edward VII the épiait between the azaleas or that birds sang in Greek.
It has never seen a man also patient and in love with a literary talent névrosée which exceeded the madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "That was Martín-Santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja?
That tried Benet if it is to Rifleman Baroja by Faulkner?
That made it if it is to suck up the glory of this man to act as its pedestal? "
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved from the APS and not weighing more than kg, and without saying a word, they kicked two assenèrent who left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack a defenceless animal small free which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking slowly and that, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène attack an animal that is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, ultimately, anyone lower than him.
The episode occurred around 17 p.m., Tuesday as another in a district usually quiet.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
We have of course filed a complaint to the police station of the area, although we doubt that it serves little and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they are fun to free a defenceless animal abuse that we give affection, friendship and we would like company.
We do not know where's the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish for Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the helmet, mainly among the younger riders, as indicated today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in case of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, "goes beyond the design and manufacturing of products always safer" and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign to encourage the motorcycle helmet, under the motto "To be or not to be" will have a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has pointed out that the road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the union Patronal and Ganvam manufacturers Anfac, the dealers.
However, it should be qualify the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared with the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of registrations last month, the accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, adding up all vehicles which fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, light trucks, vans, pick-up trucks and light chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect the more their request did not dispelled. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, who pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the restriction of bank credit, must be added other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation and the difference of passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it reminded once again the need for the administration to pay close attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association provides a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
The emergency brake assistance is now mandatory
As has occurred with the ABS brake system and as this will take place with the ESP stability control systems, the emergency brake assistance will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while in the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the emergency brake detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not support on the brake before the crash, and half of them had not benefited from any strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the assistance, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car to need to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents where pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called emergency braking intelligent systems: It calculates that a disaster on four, with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a camera or a radar detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if this is necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors pushes up in January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory of Figueruelas (Saragosse) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April - probably the 8 - from Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, meant that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and the governments of the countries where the plants, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer so that it takes a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes the importance.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewellery, engineers are parties to the Porsche Boxster S and succeeded in the thinning of just less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof was replaced by a manual open roof, to reduce to 21 kilograms, to use aluminum doors as the GT3, another 15 kilos of less, to remove the climatiseur, 13 kilos, to reduce the gasoline tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing bacquets of sport, yet 12 kilograms, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have abandoned the audio system and CDR-30, winning six other kilograms and have replaced the doors by handles poignéesdes in tissues, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the box PDK double clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads in California, in mountain, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The decrease weight does not prevent the car rolling on the floor with aplomb.
On the contrary: It was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees as security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for the time, until we ask of sprinter, to curb, recover and grow again its engine...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also communicative that states, the car will that will indicate our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Its engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer reunion, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, either to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are farms, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The surface of the road that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence on all the way, while we found some turns on the ice during the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more fun to drive, which is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be the sale in February 2010, at a price of € 70.
"Bag Girl"

The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received a resounding triumph in 91-82 during his visit on the ground hard of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences from which the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is so high on his group, after the big show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of the evaluation team (29).
The team of Vitoria has managed to fill absences important Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great ability since the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets, determined largely marked the final victory.
The game began quickly to the blue and red, who took the early advantage.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, foreshadowed that they had jumped on the ground of Israel with the wrists hot.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 final of first quart-temps.
The second quart-temps was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the domestic game and the work of Barac Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause to return to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get out as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, while the "least six" Splitter assessment was already showing that this night would not be the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their land, and through "the hand of Elias', they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to ensure that the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other challenges
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to pick up a few shares entitled to take the air, and it is at this time that arises the Teletovic of Mirza submachine gun that, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the assistance of English and Ribas gave the meter to a score reassuring (54-67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quart-temps (57-67).
The team to Avala went out to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio avisèrent (60-75) that they were tired person their take what they had earned during the 30 first minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, are not résignèrent and tried to the support since the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for misconduct, the players from Ivanovic did not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85), the party was already performed and the victory was in Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injury battle to prevent the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost loudly Olympiacos in Greece in the face and has given him the head of Group B of the Euroligue in a game marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, particularly in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of the Peace and Friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quart-temps, helped to dream the Andalusia. An aggressive defence and three consecutive three-point baskets, two of the leader Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio has dazzled the home team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the domestic game and Schortsanitis Bourousis, Vujcic, has led to the overthrow of the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, an early fight, North American leaders between Beverley and Williams has led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began operating in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit to injury in the central English Joel Freeland and the three personal offences of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their baskets to three points, created a 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
A rebound impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos that, despite the 19 losses, was higher and arrived even to match the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, as the leader of the group reeling.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the final exit from the Scottish hub Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, through his organization, the three-point baskets of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 3-66 in the 57st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were relentless pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The pivot Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to trace the score at 81-62 in the th minute, and the Unicaja is submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Facebook users may know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" Calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job opportunities available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week that the application works, the search engine has found that in general, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," said in a news release the head of Trovit products, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available from its Trovità search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer sees gross annual € 45,226 and a French, 31, 059, when a Spanish receives EUR 24 000.
Similarly, a driver is gross annual EUR 34 247 in England, 25 in France, and 751 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the work the less well paid in Spain is that of server, with annual net EUR 11 592, followed by the seller, with EUR 14 725, and that of Ouvrier, with EUR 15 667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet during the past three months are the driver, part-time jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for the start of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president should abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda Affairs, on Brazil's embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before this date.
"It is aware that he must start on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination".
The chain has also cited the former agent, which confirmed its intention that leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the Brazilian government support Zelaya," said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally failed, since Zelaya refused the status of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where officers take decisions on a future uncertain in nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been almost finalized and, without questioning their political maverick liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to one year to the next week.
Accordingly, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing an inversely to the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the corporate bond spreads rise again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels that they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters selected by investors, causing an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor its threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who tried to provoke a new case of conscience in lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of limiting the credit derivatives on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore him to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot in roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a not respect its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences of the public debt rises to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn' not have to worry.
If the European gap decreased and that our continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forward-looking indicators require most of the services of studies to anticipate their recovery models and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the burden with a Spanish economy so Japanese model, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to provide an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if at the moment "caution is the mother of safety".
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán has outlined to the press that he had raised before the Subcommittee on camera.
For the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 million more between 000 and 2030, where nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not rise to 60 million in 000 and 95.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be devoted to the increase in production capacity, but the distribution networks and the international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses both on the gas to coal plants, with recovery mechanisms of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other energy "support".
Galán, who believes that the draft Act of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line that calls for his company, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat climate change.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "ponctuelles", as the has qualified the chairman of Iberdrola.
Nevertheless, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, should begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching maturity and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial won the market handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial to the airport services on land, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for the services of goods, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris or Frankfurt, London, Brussels is one of the most important.
The agreement, including the economic terms have not been disclosed, has a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of collaboration to create the intelligent infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance will invest $ 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will be provided by Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona dispute its first highway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession market in Australia, on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (around EUR 1 047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a dealer of highways and public works.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to have to end 2014.
After having chosen the public/private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, in the framework of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (around EUR 1 047 million) and in the final phase will face three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Spanish firm Acciona, only in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British firm Laing O'Rourke, the Australian manager Transfield infrastructure and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of GBA), another local company, Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in the Public Works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but enter represents a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the firms Bilfinger and Hochtief, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
GBA is just to win a place on the market by its 30 per cent stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Active millionaires
Acciona put on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the sector of the desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the consolidation of companies responsible for building and managing the dessalinisateur in Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.
The toll underground route, promoted by the Office of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (Liaison north), is called upon to connect Highway Toowong to the western peripheral route to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work would begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road traffic will open at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two times two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and the Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position of clubs that have received the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United tops the list.
The Manchester United tops the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to the information of UEFA.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this division.
The white club was the third of the continent to reach the more money for his participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently taking the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have charged the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, although they have lost to the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn $ 1 million through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million fixed payments: Each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have been able to participate have received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550,00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighth final of each receive three million, the eight teams arriving in a quarter-final reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will earn 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and up to 31.2 million.
Secondly, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for having won the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there is the variable payments, which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportion of each television market value.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four dedicated spaces.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid based on the number of games played over the issue of the year.

The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourism all-terrain motorcycles, 109, 137, 78, 44 vans and trucks.
Of course, for use, a computer and an Internet connection is required.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question is then selects the necessary part.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications for return to the client.
