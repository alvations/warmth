A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders condoned their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, Brennan sees it as a myth, saying that the electoral fraud is increasingly rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: the new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the elections in November 2010 which saw will add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011.
The new election laws require that voters show photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on election day and withdraw citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities clamoured to extend this to other states.
Over the past two years, they are its sponsors bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card as the map of the insurance.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, does not have a photo ID cards issued by a government agency of their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a piece of identification.
However, it often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain the identity card required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with photo.
Much more.
The students, voters considered voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.
However, these same States allow members of fishing clubs or hunting who vote more on the Republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State demanded proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Moreover, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing registration of voters on election day in eight states.
Moreover, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns have helped to save about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 has fallen 17 percent the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of voters in the state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11 percent of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who formed 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of the electorate voting in advance.
Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the law's most controversial.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see this as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: the new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to undergo screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, European, concluded in a difference of mortality among patients who have been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have the cancer if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had cancer of the prostate.
The African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are slow.
We really need to understand the patient the riskiness of his cancer, with the possible options, not treating necessarily the prostate cancers that do not affect the life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have detects cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They will suggest the active monitoring and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Increasingly, it is precisely the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if it should go or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If nobody smoked, this rate increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This night enormously to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deplores the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half.
The weight
The overweight and obesity also foster the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against cancer of the colon," nutrients.
Food
The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer.
The sausages, too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by smoking, curing or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it was suggested.
The vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, are not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them was a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on breast cancer is not clear either.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with her doctor.
"Spend a screening test, it does not give the cancer."
The Higgs kernels
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe.
And then, is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is authentic Ramsis particle, and that it is very much like the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be perfectly clear.
Suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law must inevitably that two things cannot get to the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt you.
Even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that she, too, such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, the particle physicists fall into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely to obey the Pauli principle.
And in another move the bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least, not for this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, Laboratoires Berkeley: the mesons, that we cannot tackle here, and "particles of force," by which the large forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs would somehow related.
These bosons-là, it must be pointed out, are not all exotic critters also than you might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson wondrous banality: the photon, or particle of light, "which is the" messenger "of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge up or change of direction, this "disturbed" the electromagnetic field in this area, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" was born an electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.), and the wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus, one of the bosons "bearers of force."
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs, this is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" that this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; pour l'exciter, there is very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond which only a very big rock could ride the surface.
This is why we need a huge particle accelerator at CERN - such as the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 miles in circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is more useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is indeed not all particles, or all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never himself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not.
Now, what does' can make "all this research, asked Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any difference between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also more fervently hope that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and fill some holes.
This, it must be said, still has a huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or dark matter, which form about 80% of the terms of the Universe (re-oups!).
But it has not found any such disparities at CERN until now.
Impact
The implications of this research in the lives of ordinary people, and they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Consider: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, do not realize the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first laser (the first continuous pulsed were, in 1962, at the outset the laser was seen as a "gimmick of lab."
Imagine...
And then, applications may also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, in the course of its work in perspective.
This sensor, although this was not at all its original intent, now serves as a "eye" in digital cameras of the world, and he won the 2009 Nobel Physics.
This does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir
With his Commission to die with dignity, Quebec recently described the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to look more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the region.
Prostate cancer who gnawed a respite for two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I made seven years ago," he said, one who was lying in his bed at the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, it could not be prepared for it," he said.
The disease is his work: a huge weakness that makes it impossible to travel to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Attablé before a delicious lunch, he agreed to leave help to eat, resigned.
Courageux, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are scrambling around him, give him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I will cure diarrhea, it is humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man, it pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Régresser at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's capacity to accept the regression," he says.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, of great moments are at the heart of this decline.
The patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a prognosis of living up to three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them has consistently said "curative care."
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is dying "conscious and stifled."
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she says.
"I no longer wishes in life," she says, before admitting that he poses a mask to help him breathe.
It expects all the same, in the next few days, a recent visit to his son Venu of Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, we can offer, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and helps to food.
These are the palliative care, giving when there's nothing else to do.
To make the death penalty more comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
This is very little when we know that we end up all dead.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, "explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
At the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In the dying, it will provide care of mouth brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to monitor their blood sugar.
And death is part of daily life.
Last night, it was served a beer with Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who completed the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"It helps the family as the patients," said Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At home, the Victor-Gadbois days.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who is relishing his latest family assembly in the courtyard, good luck in its pillows while it is falling in her honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after all tried to survive.
"For the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to hospice palliative care, which is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this huge gap in health care that worried several doctors who specialize in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed palliative care experts including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Québec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone has a right to palliative care quality before it agrees to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days to the emergency, in great pain, without that we take the necessary steps to relieve it.
I fear that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she abandoned a wrenching chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I arrêtais treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop to beat me, "she told me.
However, she had told me I was finished.
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking to die thanked caretakers of not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment against the pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors have so often use palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, sporadically, either permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you euthanasiiez" means "I want to be relieved."
The achievement of this story was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Real estate Scandales in Quebec
Officials from the Highways, businessmen from the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and an expert on the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system, combining the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
"Industry" a great cost to taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"This is curious as the system crumbles since it took the great resources," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Québec and former Chief of Police of Montreal.
It is the scandal erupted in 2011, through a background investigation on embezzlement linked to contracts for road work in Quebec, in which the Liberal premier, Jean Charest, had agreed that backwards.
The "Report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, occult financing of political parties and corrupt officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he noted, the Department of Transportation would have saved $1 billion on the contracts," some réfrénant their instincts to reach a share.
The Commission Charbonneau "has already brought down two mayors," ajoute-il, hoping that it gets to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also is working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
Most members of the squad "Hammer," which since 2009, were said to have led the cartel "sewer" of Montreal to put the pedal on the soft swell of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted searches in number and scope for fraud and corruption charges against city officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally charged in addition to the road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
It caused a sensation in explaining the mechanics of the "system of obtaining government contracts.
He has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who reversait money to the Union, the party of the Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr zambito sowed everyone winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to parties, especially the Liberal provincial then in power.
He also confessed to having organized a fundraiser for the legal ex-vice-premier Minister Nathalie Normandeau liberal.
A sewer contracts which it inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system of corruption functioned smoothly.
Gilles surprising ex-ingénieur, public works, has detailed well before the committee: in 10 years, it has received gifts of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736 000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts which it inflated costs.
Other officials from the Highways admitted being grease the leg by 30% to 40% by false invoices extras.
Then an organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel Outine budget coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials from Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Rivière, east of the island, it reacts as early as 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will eventually be put in place, it said that it "takes on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the rot and pinpoint wrongdoing."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but it should be an investigative unit to Montreal and a watch, not to see a return of dubious practices.
As the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials aware of the scheme," when they don't trempaient in the politicking!
Believing at 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to the parties, but it will not change the situation, he said: "as long as it is not confined strictly election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding of public contracts and financing of the parties: "you can't go lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec City and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own back yard.
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new scope with PSG.
How do you explain this?
This can be explained by an awareness of individuals, but also by the new dimension of the MTP.
Great players arrived.
Every day, I progress at their side.
The technical staff has also contributed much.
Every day, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it is easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I do not ignite.
My debut at the center of formation of the INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I always put forward by levels.
So you can take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits this summer are accustomed to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every Downdrag is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He is assisted by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with posh clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him comforting.
Then I ran out of a series of injuries.
It gives me confidence that also explains my performance.
What is your view on the first part of the season for PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final of 8es with the way.
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to receive during the 8th.
PSG could become a European club in the short term?
It has already the budget...
To become a European club, Paris needs to win titles and.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially Financial support, PSG has the means to make this happen.
In Ligue 1, not to win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we were really keen to pocket the title of champion.
Last season, it has not gone away.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
It was a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more.
This year, I think this is the right.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you feel the media wait too.
It is normal that we expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and players we have.
Did we agree completely.
Later, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to blame us, of course it is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
You can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built over time.
It has been shown in the Champions League that we could respond now.
Look at Manchester City that doesn't happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the final of 8es, they also made huge spending!
In the light of the money invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead at the truce.
It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been inspired by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile and said that, despite all the difficulties, it has prevailed.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better than we say that there is a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and that it puts a lot of goals.
He came to that and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
He demonstrated wherever he went that he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This leads others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.
How did you lived the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I was concerned to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from claw game time.
I saw things there and I am emerged stronger.
Today, I can achieve good matches in selection.
This is what I was hoping for my baptism for France.
It was learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and today must be exemplary.
What is your view on the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Lions?
He has the results for him.
It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White had achieved its goal in qualifying for Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Lions in Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) pulled, 16 October, Spain is a founding match?
This match has given us confidence.
Each has fought for everyone.
Prior to this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the central banks, transactions identified and the costs of treatment between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to the financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros) and a memorandum of secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files.
About 200 000 Transaktioner have already been made thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes as "the bitcoin virtual currency had the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as the "credits," used to move forward in a video game is won by playing or that one can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But every time a central authority and control trafficking trade.
With Bitcoin noeuds, all of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual-key cryptography.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged certainly exists in the book of public accounts, broadcast across the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line.
It is a phase of hash of file, i.e. transformation of a large file in a digital footprint shorter and unique.
The computers "are" the new transaction and he added a number before "chop" together.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many digits.
Once this number found, the other noeuds easily verify that this is the right.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.
If, for defrauding, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (within 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are visible until the 100 millionth, which leaves scope...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted for each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
A Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stealing bitcoins in deposits.
"The flaw used is not the protocol itself," said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency Bitcoin using the network.
The ECB also mentioned the possibility of money laundering through this service anonymous.
But the cash also has this defect.
An actor as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November, "giant" balances have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are less expensive.
The carrier operates more its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement other merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They need only communicate an address that a telephone can "photographed and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning of the hierarchical systems for systems more horizontal.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point" per years, he predicts.
The ECB, in his report, intended to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We went from Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in the Kapisa and Surobi (Afghanistan).
NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.
It is mostly Afghan peasants we punished by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, and maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former Heads refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, as of the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by Pakistani jihadists, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik,.
Toléré, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will also when the West will be more discreet.
The departure of the French troops of the Nijrab base, that I have seen from the top of the hills planted almond thanks to French credits is in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
There will be no flood of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country on fire because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants exceeded by the organization of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former mujahideen, current Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main leaders of the Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into the business of government land for resale in lots in the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge "subcontracting American contracts.
They have discredited; most of them have not fought themselves.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who took advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full, girls as boys.
It will provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the TV, and his Turkish soap operas that have a modern world is followed everywhere.
The army is now.
The authorities, which will order it be regarded as legitimate?
A former commanders of the Soviet struggle is already concern of provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be given a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States has sought to transform into a centralized State, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been fadl en route, no dam is important, no irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was pleased that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that the West was to take them over.
Without energy to treat iron ore and copper on the ground, or by means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left for Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) search huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It also will one day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of French troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support, the Delegation logic.
Since 2009, to try to "win the hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, and is carried out by a small French NGO, many community service and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, "local labour-intensive work, could help to contain the insurgency: wells, irrigation, drinking water, reforestation, trees, protection of the soil and increase the arable.
As we remember that, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of local, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.
The embassy has received dozens of requests made of small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For that they disperse from the insurgency led by foreign groups, what farmers have told me, we should keep in their favour a small civilian assistance, well controlled and that affects them directly.
A Constitution for forceps in Egypt
This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him temporarily full powers, he decided to play its protagonists.
Took everybody by surprise, it announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote in his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had awarded two additional months in this House to finish its work.
For almost two years that Egypt is based on a draft text, several times amended that weakens the institutional stability and legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, President pushes ahead with his "autocratic style," continuing of "betraying its word" and "trample the law."
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that this is a way to bring to an end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians.
For President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy, while the dispute raged across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Although the resort to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers," supposedly expire after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing.
Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing not having been able to express their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
So that the quorum is reached, 11 people, members, alternates were added in haste, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, this is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Some commentators are amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee considering that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was poorly regulated.
The text, which was still in the process of being voted yesterday evening, 234 articles.
Objects of attention, Article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace the "principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisie," replied the liberals, who see it as just a communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University in an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is worrisome because "people called a vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less than the current moderate.
"For the moment, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not intellectuals and academics, some trained in the French system "temper Blouet Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledged that "there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrowed religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" Islamic jurisprudence, including [ed].
And the question could arise in the future the extent of the civilian judges are competent to rule on it. "
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are considerably reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Council of defence.
Nor will prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem hostage.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, freedom of the press in particular.
Moreover, no article does more to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president must speak yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will be marching them Saturday.
In Israel, the holy places, the Centre of the world and a sea of brine await the Ukrainian Kumpanija

"That language has, in Moscow will": migrants save money to learn the language
While the Members and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose: to earn money to support their families back home.
Since 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and the retail sale.
However, over time, promised the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
He will have to validate their language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Are free only nationals of the country where the Russian has the status of an official language.
The people who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of the rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of the friendship of the peoples, the State University of Moscow, Saint Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants can pass the exams in cities across the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce exams was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, the human rights activists have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what is it going to give?
What is the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and immigrants?
Firstly, the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery."
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of selection organized will solve the problems at 90% of the foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, future migrant is intended to encounter dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "trip" in a crowded house where he and dozens of others are tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and must work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected wage," confirms the Chief Executive Officer of the migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
I do not stop, the police!
However, many of the republics of Central Asia who want to earn money in Russia that they do not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair.
Indeed, their families have not even enough to feed their children without speaking to dress properly and to equip them for the school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave earn money when the opportunity arises.
It is difficult when you don't know the language they hand over a lifetime.
"You feel diminished and undermined."
Defenders of Human Rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language.
The reviews will be designed solely to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no review or official work.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome to enter or defence."
Many immigrants explained that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? administrative barriers and language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you may get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we do not have to register, where cases of extortion.
"They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," confided to reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
"I quickly, without skimping achète-toi and a beautiful work of art."
From the first day of the entry into force of the law relating to the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers out of a common colour printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the power and the defenders of human rights to agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."
The authorities can give migrant workers who were unable to validate the review of the first blow the time for language.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve to actively communicate with people.
The Ministry of the Interior has not of the arms market
The share of crimes involving illegal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against holders of civilian firearms.
Such is the reaction of the authorities in response to recent incidents: that there be performed at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven deaths.
The police wants to ban the carrying of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a permit to carry a weapon from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centers of fire, demand to abandon "this senseless."
The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, told the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on civilian weapons will not deter criminals to supply to the black market.
According to them, you can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior says that he control the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market of weapons is provided through multiple channels.
The main channels are number five, "says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Headquarters.
Capture of screen from a site taking orders of weapons
The first is "on track," i.e. weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," said Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the police.
Baranets explains that these weapons stolen in the stocks of the police as those stolen directly to the representatives of the security forces.
The illegal guns go on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"A certified versions indicate that some of the fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit," says the former military.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons plants that cannot compete with the competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local artisanal production, sometimes, a mafia was formed and organizes the supply," says the former military.
Where are the weapons?
The experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was formed in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for public administration.
Experts have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data portals relating to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explained the researchers, comes from the army and the police.
Half of the weapons on the black market has recovered "by lack of employees whose work is related to weapons," it was suggested in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal excavations."
A salesman and a gun store consultant who asked to remain anonymous ensures that long ago nobody buys weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine searches; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for new goods in warehouses.
The person purchases through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.
It also delivers the goods by a screen.
"He carries it in town and sells it for 900 €per unit with two magazines," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, it makes a purchase of control from merchants of illegal weapons," says the salesman.
"As in a luxury boutique."
The seller and the buyer are typically through knowledge.
I have consulted the sites, blogs, until a type occurs and me to come to the station of Begovaya where someone was to take me in a corner "to haggle."
The price of the gun, it was provided on site
Viktor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust it.
There are sellers on the market, but there must also come by saying for example "on the part of such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I buy even a pair of American fists with the aid of a person to whom I trust.
I delivered them to me only because he knows that I do not give.
The new kids seek weapons of different ways.
The former Viktor Baranets military has tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when it was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there were "all that we want."
"I thought I was in a shop," remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, "said Baranets, we can all try.
As a potential customer, not only have I buy, it goes with the seller in the forest and it installs a target.
"You let me shoot and when I am convinced that the gun works well, it begins to negotiate," describes the expert.
A shop since his couch
The search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where one can buy guns "for different uses."
For that, it needs no document and person to meet.
"Just having a sum of money," écrit-on in advertising on the site "buy a gun or a submachine gun.
Users can leave their request and pose their questions.
And it sells to minors?
"Without a permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buys TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in its application.
The Federal Security Service released a vast network of fake sites and picks up the shovel people looking to buy weapons to fight.
People were rushing food like hungry wolves and then they use of coal in Siberia
Viktor Baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of such schemes, usually the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment on the check.
"It receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon was hidden," says the secretary of the association "right to a weapon," Dmitry Auschwitz.
Viktor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, one can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service released a vast network of fake sites and picks up the shovel people looking to buy weapons to fight.
"People were rushing food like hungry wolves and then they use of coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of a firearm illegal, the experts say, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Auschwitz of the association "right to a weapon," you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
It will take about a month and a half.
He came out of the warehouses long duration by the direction of these warehouses of average size.
According to the official data of the department, compared with the period janvier-octobre 2011, the number of these crimes has generally declined in Russia from 7% to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs dropped 7.8%.
United States: the employees of the fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of the American teenagers go through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against low salaries by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will gain or lose steam quickly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations of the left.
At the same time that the modest wages received by the employees of basis with Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of the protests seek the establishment of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," when a barrage of rain balances grabbing million inhabitants has befallen America and sometimes triggering clashes.
On that day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organize pickets with the trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are aimed at consumers of modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything: the layers of hunting rifles from a car battery, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less than the major supermarkets.
This is why many of poorly paid workers with Walmart shop solely on their place of work.
The price and the choice of products made of Walmart of one of the most powerful in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap partly because of low wages of its employees.
They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example of the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the events of the "Black Friday" demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic wage with Walmart, which affects $9.5 percent of the time, this is a sum that he cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would be tantamount to 46 cents.
They will spend in only one year 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and have brought no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am the night at midnight the following day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second.
His funds have performed in all 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday."
The company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post that left at all "less than five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was only an "operation of com 'among many others" on the part of the union organizer.
"Following Customer!"
The protests have continued this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other restaurants.
McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they did not even give you for sick leave and don't pay the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and New York is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food to increase with time, but little, on average employees Commodity- affect New York $8.90 per hour.
Nobody affects less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time where almost a quarter of the American teenagers working at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself to interview employees of McDonald's who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the board of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage.
They also sought to set up trade unions in the sector of the fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration of impeding and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For the union, seize the fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the key is the extraordinary staff rotation.
They disagree
Another tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the rally in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they did not even give you for sick leave and don't pay the work you have done honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support the employees of the fast food for that they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important sector of the fast food throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people attended without counting that not all were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.
"For the moment, it only happens moderately to fool the brain"
Recently, the fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.
At the outset, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November we heard that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the group of 3D interactive technologies from the laboratory Microsoft of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by the creation of virtual spaces open.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.
The whole of humanity has remained at the pixels on screen TVs and sometimes tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in order by the gesture.
- What we also reserves the future?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, many things unfold on screen TVs, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technologies.
It should get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.
First, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think of voice commands?
It is appreciated, but not overstated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we don't always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought with gestures, not broad gestures, but rather small, discrete gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + voice.
- That is to say?
- For example, how would you spend this who can?
You would with words and gestures.
- I spoke only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not do at a particular moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement.
I believe that very soon we will have to work for the development of new types of sensors that enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.
For example, the laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you don't like in the modern cameras?
They lack depth resolution, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we use in our work on the 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get around 8-megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c / s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds to the designers of algorithms.
We must bear in mind the resolution in the X and Y axis, but also Z.
Speed is too much, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c / s aren't really, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave a touch sensors Ougiya delay treatment between 1 and 100 μs current sensors, being closer to the second value (60).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but does not require, for having more executives in the second.
- But we not increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, "one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the returned signal.
And the third is in fact a camera sensor of the field visible.
It is not used to define the depth of the subject.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or it worse by increasing the volume required of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
- As many as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Don't you think of a point of view of the daily use of the technologies of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects?
- Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality you would from a cloud computing platform of the glasses in the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those that only you see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses from will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of the virtual Elementary objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What answers your group anticipates compared to this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of the tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting is the use of second hand to serve as a basis of image.
It captures perfectly the pressures!
But there are also some technologies that are really intended to assign palpabilité to these images "in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed to a point where the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of fresh air on the ends of the fingers.
There is also the bracelets worn on the wrist that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with the prospects.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a task on which today it will still take a long time to give the wrong: how to convince someone who is physically in a very short space walk in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also of the giant balls.
For the moment, it only happens moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization.
The reign of the taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "the Petersburg vanguard" dedicated to the people who are in advance, to the forefront of culture and art.
This list ultra-sélectif has already hosted prominent players in the art scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, all dressed in red that we may encounter near the Russian Museum, been or at parties and openings connected.
The tables of Kirill Miller still gather crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
It is one of the St. Petersburg storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the vanguard St. Petersburg branch of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and puts in a good mood.
He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role of its existence, its philosophy and its image of a bohemian.
 - Kirill, why do you go about the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise for example?
 I chose the red as dressmaker specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
 - And when you understood that you had to be a painter?
 - At the exhibition in the Cultural Palace Nevskiy the whereabouts of my work.
I understood that this was my way.
Then, the wave of the old unofficial painters and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there has been no wave.
I'm interested in the theater, fashion, music, all kinds except the words.
 - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - it was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I have taken place at Pouchkinskaya-10 that housed before the club work a musical and artistic, bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born: the NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "Van Gogh's ear."
Chnour and his friends sang songs easy for playback in tight shirts, they were among them, composer Igor Vdovin today.
When the group began to occur in live, he became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg fired not hurting emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is that they are received.
"D137 Interviews," Club "Griboedov": what are the implications of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees are party as accustomed.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the price "the personalities of our city."
I was appointed "painter of the year," and it was then that my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
 - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currency and acuity.
I'm having an exhibition scheduled "the Russian museum across the clowns."
The clowns belong to a class time.
Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and scary to be so.
But with the clowns, all fades, the tragic falls.
I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world via the total disguise and mandatory.
Today, it is the habit is important, we are looking at the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but that it should instead be spit in his face.
And lies will be erased by the disguise.
 - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play.
 - Perhaps that commercial art can also be beautiful?
 - Today the commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet wines.
The disintegration of the culture is underway.
Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the Dumb another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a ticket of $100 to please everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you're liking.
Each star has 100 fans.
 - But many thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
 - These are people that we have had to come see, this is the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, all declined.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are those painted at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse the ideas.
It said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money for the painting.
I am for this culture.
 - Kirill, what does in St. Petersburg?
 - A good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But all may not work in the culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path.
Currently, this is the "reign of taste" which blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
 - For you, what is St. Petersburg?
 - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital to Moscow, there is far more culture, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art has struggled to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers and readers, this is bad.
In Europe, there are many people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this layer is very close.
We must make art in fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project with the support of the award of St. Petersburg
Accoucher in space
The Earth is in danger.
Warming or collision with an asteroid murderers.
A caravan of space shuttles with earthlings aboard in search of a planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to keep our species in weightlessness or on a planet?
I believe that there are not a lot of choice.
There are in fact two true planets that we can win, not even as a hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If the conditions on Mars are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
Attention began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
There is still a century, it was conducting experiments on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit is in no way were different varieties of the Earth.
Then it was put into orbit of the insects, small flies breeding flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
One gets a chick perfectly normal.
It is then that the problems start.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must be put on its feet and start moving," says the director of the Laboratory of the Institute of the safety problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding no support, the chicks are waved in a haphazard manner.
And after 10 p.m., the babies saw their fully atrophying instincts.
The chicks did not react to the light and sound.
Unfortunately, they died just after four days.
"We" twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there, "explains Vladimir Sychev in recognizing the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The latest "organic" miniature ark with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" ship that the species of the same sex.
There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, there is nothing natural described.
"It was again the biosatellites and then this is the only experience. we must do this kind of research," remarked Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats have given birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it still fails to make reproductions directly into space.
This is not a trivial matter.
In losing their normal environment, the animals are no longer able to carry out their instinct.
Unlike the beasts, the man is capable, in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional substance.
This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons.
But women are going into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity's most valuable asset.
Our seagull flew and person on Earth could not say if it held after a flight into space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody responded to this issue," says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the area of the rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaïev.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and has even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to one offspring in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
But humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Laboratory Centre for Hydrology Preparationof cosmonauts: mandatory step in preparation for the flight.
Here, in no buoyancy, the cosmonauts train to the exits extra-véhiculaires.
The water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Insofar as the baby grows about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb of her mother, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is logical in principle, because since its birth in the bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child just born weightlessness is a more natural state, women need a force of gravity.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis is size decreases very rapidly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Good agreement, ignore it based on the birthing simulators.
Of course you can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will bring it out.
"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If he did not feel the terrestrial attraction, the agency does not form the skeleton or muscular system.
You can't pay an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we will have to consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté," provides the Director of the committee on bioethics of the Institute of the safety problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the area is still theory.
However, over time it will become a reality, when the Terrans travelling in their commuting to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI public finances) said: "the control of the pseudo self-employment (in Czech" Švarc system ") failed due to the politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.
This is what said Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is missing here," said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A control conducted jointly by inspectors Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abuse the approach of the "system" by Petr Nečas Švarc.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls; is permitted or forbidden?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it bans anything, even the head of the government cannot stop the action an investigating authority to inspect demand respect for the law," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Oversight in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which were compared the laws governing public procurement of these two countries.
What was the question?
It is a parallel control that we launched about two years.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and national laws and an actual practice to follow.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "tougher and better quality," however, according to certain parameters, such as the practice is best in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually elaborate rules of increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
Why is this project can help you and what is the result?
A joint control of this type should contribute to what we stopped trying to clarify the laws, lowering and improve the thresholds, when it was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude all enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained above.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different?
For those institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof organized similarly, it also has a board constituted a little differently, but these two institutions are basically the same way.
The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a tinge however compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it also has the accounts of this type in the various Länder.
The HRB can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, there are controlled at the level of the accounts of the Länder.
With regard to national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, definitely not, but I repeat, I did not have data for comparison.
However, it must also be said that this country that we see as a model is also facing a series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
With regard to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are they already feel?
This amendment came into force relatively recently, it does not have any impact on our operations.
As we make up checks, there is a delay.
Our comments relate only, for the moment, the process of preparing the future control - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public markets - where these changes will come naturally feel, because the thresholds have changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.
Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
The problem that may arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to meet them.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) forces controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Let's where we will not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
The system is allowed or prohibited Švarc?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it bans anything, even the head of the government cannot stop the action an investigating authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.
He may declare: "we are going to change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the paperwork and this, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder be removed only for cause of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is missing here.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain workable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow also.
The network, however, remains largely impassable in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were passable this morning, but in some places also frozen and snow.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5 ° C and -10 ° C but should recover slightly in the day.
The snowfall has ceased in the region and it remains in the plains that a thin layer of snow.
The crests of Krušné hory (Ore Mountains), however, are covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
According to data from the regional service roads because of the fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The expressway R6 and national roads in the region are now passable without difficulties.
The vigilance remains to be set, for example on some bridges that can be frozen and slippery pavement.
All the roads and paths of third category, including mountain roads are passable.
There is still some of their sections of the remains of frozen snow and places compacted by the traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Parts of Pardubice and Hradec Kralove
The Directorate of roads and highways reported on its Web site that some roads of Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers of compacted by the traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous and located in altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in the areas of the region of Pardubice situated at altitude.
Freezing rain can occur in the vicinity of Lanškroun Ústí nad Orlici, Polička Svitavy, or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the roads and third category.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 in the vicinity of Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow lies mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagles (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou Trutnov and a layer of compacted snow by traffic on the roads in areas located in altitude.
In Bohemia, the time will be dry today, most often found, with possible cloudy periods.
It will be a light wind and temperatures will vary widely between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Area of Pilsen
The roads in the area of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise increased vigilance and adjust to the weather.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snow and chill that followed, some channels of communication may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, visibility improves however gradually.
This is the information of the regional service roads.
The highway was impassable D5 almost without difficulties, the maintenance of the road communications, however, recommended increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sectors may be frozen in the District of Pilsen-Sud and Tachov district.
The departmental channels and third category are moist and in this case applies cautioned against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, and especially on roads less traveled to the region of the Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling in the areas of the region of Olomouc Bunnpris today must reckon with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads.
This layer remained on the Col said "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical processing operations.
The snowfall forced Tonight maintenance personnel of the roads to get on the ground; according to the services in charge of the roads, it fell more than three centimeters in the District of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulties.
"On the heights of the District of Šumperk lie the remains of snow.
The drivers moving in the direction of Jeseník should expect to meet Col said "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick layer of snow and soft, "said today at ČTK the head of road maintenance services for the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also went on site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment performed, roads, are now open and wet, even in the highest parts.
In the District of Olomouc roads are passable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in the sections in forest areas to pavements remained moist.
Parts of Ústí nad Labem, Liberec
As of this morning, road maintenance services of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to data from the police, in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore the snow and ice should remain on the roads. in the plains, especially in the south of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement has been reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its training: rain and melting of snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
There were also reports, since the main roads, difficult conditions on National Route 13 at the border between the regions of Usti nad Labem, Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice Knínice and is due to branches of trees that were bent under the weight of the snow to reach the floor.
Šimon Ornest said: "in concert, we want to collect the positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month that should be the end of the world?
This is just one of these new alarming, the kind of trap in which we love fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, rather laugh and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a remnant of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you're in December a project quite unique: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present in more detail this project to our readers?
This is a charity that we prepare for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for the 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the time will end the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, on a timezone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.
Who was this idea?
At the outset I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to work together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, shirts, bags, and the original key against the end of the world, they bought online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other performers has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is entitled "end of the world (in Czech" Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will they be heard during these charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world did not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Joining the anthems at some time in the context of a live show, utterly unique, Czech television.
The lyrics of this song was written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How do you come to cooperate with them?
We are working with other personalities of the Czech actors, owing to the fact that we organize concerts and charitable events...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and fun.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to the disabled and we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and it for six years.
Teachers are regularly with students of the institute Jedličkův and propose activities that interest them and enjoy them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go over, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička we will transfer this project in a new independent building.
A number of music groups and performers will end up on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria do you choose?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague, will end up on stage, Support Chinaski Lesbiens Illustratosphere, with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Preparing also to others "mega-events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the context of the Prague Spring; here, too, we will surely be a quality program with guests interesting.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
International projects are minimal, up here you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and the logistics of your shot?
This is not so terrible that it looks at first glance.
We have five members including the electric wheelchair must travel in bunker gear, of course we trimbalons too much luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything is always more or less well past, CSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ with regard to access facilities for the disabled, the attitude of the public towards persons with disabilities and so forth.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow to the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only by electric chair in the center of the city.
They are still not as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift.
Fortunately there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of the disabled is being created.
How do we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things for which we are still behind...
It is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements are always dependent on efforts by the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
This is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you're, The Tap Tap, rather the contrary to the forefront of progress.
Respect for the public and facilities are one thing, but the situation really begins to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?
I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am musician (I play, among others, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
The success came in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
This is true, creating links with known singers and work actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can we afford quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Were you aiming to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of tricks that copy from each other.
In a way, it is logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...
But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for all of society.
Does your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to make the quality work, we must be firm in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve objectives.
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group open, people come and go, we cannot do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
It will be the case on the eve of the day scheduled for the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Arena Incheba, Brno and Ostrava in Fléda to Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
Late in the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio relay when will jointly sang the song of the band The Tap Tap "end of the world cancelled."
The aim of the concert is to collect funds (25 million CZK) to equip the functional training centre Studeo who is in Prague in the institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets opened at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed has participated in a number of projects of the agency.
The road from Poland to space has however started much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they did not always understanding.
I would like to mention for example the conference of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his pioneering book entitled "Introduction to the astronautics."
The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski became interested in its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to the astronautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski relevant (1899-1966), who became a big propagator of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics of world renown, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925 was built in Poland a flanged wheels designed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, there is neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear if the rocket was intended to propel or curb the flanged wheels.
The only known about this flanged wheels are those of the press.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It emerges from the documents kept that research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research findings are interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had to use a military rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the plans to use the technique of the rockets were conducted by the Scientific Advisory Board ("provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated the work.
The council was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautique were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a society in the November issue of the journal 1954, where four more detailed articles devoted to aviation.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the astronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was of the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) showed the efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and by the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket logic RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), who became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1,800 meters had a length of 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
The result was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-story rocket RM-2 were initiated in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters long and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
Following the prototype should be able to perform science - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind aloft.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The rocket Meteor-1 developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first flares of type RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for the scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 liter, while Meteor-1B in this volume was 0.34 per litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later versions were built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland at the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second cosmonaut non-soviétique of this program.
The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on public work.
This decision has raised in the public a lively discussion.
No doubt it is interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
The systems-oriented economic liberalism, both within the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of greater economic competition unregulated.
In practical terms, this means that economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free movement (without limits) of private capital ally to a rampant financial speculation.
The significant differences in the cost of labour (wages) generate a tension on the price.
It should be put under this term meaning: a producer tries by the importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in "making it more expensive" the price of a competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappear. the result is high unemployment in the country where the price of the work are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment it brings, the social costs of the State may increase.
All this situation intensifies the unwillingness of the contractors to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies creates a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.
This is manifested mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force economically his own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This happens partly by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
It follows a growing poverty and deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, there is the public distribution points for food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already per million people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes fully aware that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay a premium to reach the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament.
The economy measures of almost all the Member States of the south of the EU, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or just stumble along with low wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.
We should ask themselves the following question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, so the poverty will rise from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian African or will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media, to get bored, that the state cannot make capital investment in its own economy, as the economy headed led to an economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state may not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It is then whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the state as a whole.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby and present in all states.
This results in a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of the draft legislation law firms closely tied to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All of the power comes not from the people, as the state constitutions of Western-type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "the rule had long been in full decline and functions were assigned by the violence.
Rockbursts faveurs bribes, illegally obtained, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The Russian banking system has collapsed kickbacks and corruption without limits and people went to the election with votes already sold... "..." the honest people did not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State was 8 months without consuls.... "'We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." it is true that Appianos Pompé had in mind, but this is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to advance the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior to the elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, we can see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of the type of liberal democracies as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises which we are now witnessing and crimes against humanity as we know them by the recent and ancient history.
The repeal of the law on the public work is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both international and domestic level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to explore ways to reduce the level of social security for the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution lies in reforms to political goals, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital into the company to the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever of violence and never will," says Sting in the song called Fragile whose main towards the refrain is "let us not forget how much we are fragile."
"If my son wanted no wars, it would not," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high.
Some take advantage of Israel, asserting its right to defend itself and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recurring waves of killings; after all, the current residents of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view, located behind the curtain, "on which benefit mainly to long-standing tensions already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East.
Some of these ideas are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerged from my own understanding of that, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they had their actions to the throne to someone who ran their acts on the basis of pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when the global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration causing some financial powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation.
Among families with an astronomical wealth particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule it out).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they have built the first World News Agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and who had always meant for them to tighten their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare for or carry out wars against the countries in which they have not yet such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of the Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to send money home and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the Member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF to have triggered the Great Depression.
Their thirst for power at the global level has resulted in the years 1859 in 1871 in the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially in the United Kingdom, and the third is expected to reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid that are not repeated crises like those that they caused in 1907).
After responding to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand Hapsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed in Germany of horrible war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they can then place a strong enough leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she was actually) of fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began.
A terrorist acts were committed by all sides.
The second world war began; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the shackles in which international bankers had held initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps established the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed in Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has ignited a conflagration that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or Muslim population generally of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level (just look at how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where there is, at the root of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?
This should make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because just like us, international bankers did not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) grow to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which handles 20 percent of all the world's oil (naval corridor has a width of 2 miles) and lead to destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now appear to be the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new born is to implement an electronic chip making him a totally controlled.
"They are forcing all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and bond to cover the hand or forehead a trademark red iron, so that he could neither buy nor sell whoever does not bear the name of this wild beast, or the number of his name.
We must understand: anyone who has common sense account numbers of this wild beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six. "
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators took Islamist students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for decades.
The situation was not in the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in effect, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, even worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats séquestrés were eventually released 444 days later, after negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory for America.
Just before it is occupied, while six employees of the embassy.
After a few detours complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a whirlwind coverage: they left the country with their Canadian passports as members of a team of filming here to do the groundwork for the shooting of a film to show of fiction.
Combination of genres.
The plan of the field exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the story more credible, specialized magazines did state of this film project, press conferences were organized and a shadow production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were long secret, the film is based on the recollections of Tony Mendez.
The film, Affleck is a combination of several kinds.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The Musiciennes move: sequences of Tehran of documentary style (in the captioned sequences are presented to the iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration.
And then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career.
The actor ridiculed, he became a director and respected his game of actor has ceased to generate ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature dark after the police "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
This is also the first movie Affleck who is not taking place in his home town of Boston.
The meaning of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also showing that sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "shall" by Canada.
The best scenes from the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, is writing a page of history.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the wrong team of filming in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many shares at too many places
The director had to settle for a subject is in fact that few thrilling scenes, the film sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is sidelined by a phone call in America and the prosecution on the runway are pretty far-fetched).
The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are utterly charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters have deserved a larger place and it is far from being the only in this case.
The film of Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, it leaves a moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It takes the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of history, yet somehow incomplete to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he made the case.
A rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry on bank charges the most absurd, has decided to launch the competition of the regulation or the ideas from the workshop "EU" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in the direction of large European companies was at the origin of our decision," said to the newspaper Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities noted, there have already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, the women were an advantage for the rates of life insurance because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year all other idea as incredible "the workshop of the EU."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components, bio-fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been established in the past against the ban on the use of the term "spreadable butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional light bulbs.
The quality of bananas must have a size 14 centimeters.
The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be of a size 14 cm or present a "normal."
The European Commission has defined by arguing that she only harmonise national standards not homogeneous seeking trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the regulation of the EU last year that must appear on the inflatable balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. investigation that the balls are among the toys, the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 years for trumpets blowing in.
Here, too, it was strange ideas.
The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Keep Doing" liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the regulation of the Union regarding the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic reached then, for example, the volume set for the canned mushrooms risqua and a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation have found interesting the idea of paying sums of money in some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of a grant to apply for the grants.
These ideas are not from Brussels but of Prague.
"The fact of having no sea we handicap.
We are going to ask the European Union a refund. "this is expressed in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following the purchases said "interventionist", the state was found with inventory full that he had then export.
According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from the country without maritime access.
The subsidies for grants have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development headed by the Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write applications for grants from Brussels.
The EU said: "the bizarre regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fight that she no longer) raises strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs successfully defended the title "Olomoucké tvarůžky," for which the name "Tuzemský rum" dating back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."
Only alcohol-based products, sugar cane, and not out of sugar beet, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products from the EU, we are now in the company of world-renowned cheeses like feta cheese or continue to Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits, Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp and Pohořelice Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and hops in Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets Otava of" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.
The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, expresses Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how do we have the idea to stand in the presidential elections?
This is not to be a senator or president who account for me.
If all was without problems in our country, I wouldn candidate nowhere.
But I can no longer bear to see as the country was looted since last 20 years that the thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the retirement age increase.
I didn't have the ambition of a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please me, then I try to provide a solution for that change.
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any political party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you put quickly en route to the Château (Alexey Petrov: seat of the presidency).
Is it that you don't turn our backs on those who elected you?
I have always said that I will launch in the battle for the Château depending on the results of the senatorial elections
Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would come to the presidential elections.
My goal is not a function, it is merely an instrument enabling me to realize my vision.
This is why I need the influence the largest and broadest mandate.
The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television sets, but also that we are marking time everybody who try to make the change.
Added to this is the press that breaks the reputation of persons and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It was, for example, said in my statement that I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Venons-en your visions.
You began the fight for the Château with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns active beyond 20 million [of CZK].
You have to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won my case.
The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As independent, a member of any political party, I have much more likely to get the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and partisan dogma, take every party that is best for our country and implementing it.
You consider as a man of left or right?
A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me rather left.
For me, that this is a little to the left or right, it is not really important.
For me, what's important is that we move forward.
What counts for me, it is not that people are on the left or the right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contribute to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you will go when someone you are said to be a populist?
But what you said don't prouve-t-il?
When you build a business plan in a company, you also have a certain goal and vision.
You try to bring.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke were applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without the support of the parliament, you still have slogans.
You don't survivrez long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you're going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my side to impose it.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.
They would then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, bluntly, be an amateur, and not a genius, or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just throw me in politics and I try to get the support of the majority in my program.
I am trying, alone, to make things, and if it doesn't, I stop in six years and I will return in the private sector.
It is as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really angry, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people have not voted and what did have, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have written a Senate that will be hard to impose changes.
Despite everything, I will pour my vision, for example the election by direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Envisagez-vous to base your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I do not have the financial means.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent."
You don't have money?
You talk of tax returns, what's yours?
I think about 60 million worth of my personal property.
I in Prague a value of 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork with a value of about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have one Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always loved James Bond, while driving his car, was with the women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
I should debt?
I have already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate much interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.
But I could not live, for example, pay the English school of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I am not present in any elections.
You will therefore continue your commercial activities in order to live?
Did you said that you provide your activities to mute?
But this is not linked to the amount of the remuneration.
As I promised, I partially answered my activities.
For example, my assistant will take to spring the direction of travel agency.
The people that I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I feel I must live somewhere.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were contractor?
I won and I still win between two percent and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my commercial activities.
You will find this interview in Saturday's edition of the journal Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only the subject of imagination. for contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos
"I think this is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company neighbour, we said: "yes, it is actually nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need today of a library.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries ringardes, no?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom community which has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record.
The town of 80,000 souls displays the lowest rates of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city decided several years ago, contribute to the general culture and reproduce the shadow seven bridges on the euro notes in the form of miniature pretty painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus, the authorities of the city realized that there was only one way to retake control the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the architects MVRDV Rotterdam, master of the charts bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual composure and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the members of the jury still stood, bewildered and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice by order of size into a pyramid, and he finished his speech buttressed arguments activists by a common: "Dear!"
In this, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up.
The building is part of a revitalization project also includes an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This small town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a modern pedestrian zone and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades to think that they contain a dairy, a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under glass.
Admittedly, a lift takes you through the heart of the massive, but the true joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you disregard the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor lamps and elegant unequivocally speak the language of the municipal public spaces.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking for the eyes of the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, the library shelves along the facade and in the middle is a room big and dark, which is often uncomfortable and personnel," Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classic spatial configuration and open spaces for reading from the interior to the exterior.
Inside the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet Chess Club, the Centre for the environment and the technical control of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes sheathing, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the town of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is a day we found in a farm business Frisian ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it uses for years of synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and it saves time.
The end membrane is used for a season or two, then we can throw it out.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, slabs of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose smell evokes both a new car and sneakers.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After nearly 500 meters, the literary cafe offers stunning views of the city, but also of the Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.
A new donations for the soul.
"This is unbelievable, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is resolved by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun shines as little time inside, even on a sunny day.
Thick wooden beams mounted through the use of glass facade of Sunvisors, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds can do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, describes itself as "the Boekenberg vô finally found" of Spijkenisse.
There are a few weeks during the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from its library staff.
This has helped to bridge the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are overflowing.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a library half empty."
"I think our invitation has created some relationship between Anthroposophy and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration. "
Thus, MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.
Although it may seem younger and less educated.
It is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "the Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.
But she then chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support either the US position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Germany finds difficulties to adopt a clear position on the major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually destroyed by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a common and coherent policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are clashing on several fronts.
It is expecting them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.
I think they tâtonnent yet to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal."
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
That means when the term of foreign policy "normal" for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and its European partners, including as regards the national issues.
I believe that the German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and to abstain from the vote on the United Nations?
Germany had first important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
This is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
It is undoubtedly a decisive point.
However, I would award is not too much importance, because it is not purely unilateral relationship.
But this is a decisive element in the strategic thinking.
Germany present its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from voting on important issues, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
This is why I think the gap is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps that Germany will be respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences due to the US domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly made a great understanding toward the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the Government of course cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great that they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm towards the policy of Netanyahu.
Germany finds the difficulties in reconciling its close relationship with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners?
I think it does not make things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
They therefore cannot be within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they do in the current issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will be in the future a vanguard role and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role which marks more independence.
Germany is sent to play the role of a player on the international stage, Germany want only assume a key role?
Or difficulties still to play leading roles?
Germany is not yet accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many German sentiments are heard.
It does not make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From that point view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.
It must contend with neighbours and opinions varied, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy continues to diminish, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if they do not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, such is life.
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, in American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly became Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are trademarks known throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is it all about?
Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The mark enjoys protection as well as the company that bears the name cannot complain.
And even if it could, he is not sure that it would win the case.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East.
Each week, a new folder arrived on my desk.
The imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
So, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
A German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where the registrations with the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company has artificially created by claiming a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property rights.
In large cities, shopping centres on several floors that are almost as counterfeit.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents the load to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese talk of "Bang Mingpai," parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."
It is with this term that are designated women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach itself.
"This is bad for business, we must fight against this trend," requires Pattloch.
"The mark is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous."
The financial losses and costs of running into millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the flagship products.
According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and one that is growing as quickly.
However, it is not easy to expunge the dubious records of the Trademark Register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch referred to the trial in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "reality of the market."
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle prevails.
A famous case also concern graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery maker Sany, the same company that came to Putzmeister concrete pumps.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, logger of Volvo, before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW. the conflict was resolved and Geely had the change.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarism of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admitted, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would be spent last year of an "emergency situation in the conduct of the work at a restored normalcy."
Thus, the number of opposition procedures untreated dropped by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office.
Expensive act
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and it means that China is for the 10th consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also occur for the total number of illegal marks of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of law.
In other words, each recording reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle would cost much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of components for vehicles to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its rights on the Chinese TOFD Freudenberg.
"This is our fault, because the names of family cannot be protected in Germany," said Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had dismissed the objection of Munichites.
Freudenberg has prevailed with two following bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he added: "the process is long, stressful and cost us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. the archives service even had to review the actions of the last 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what you see what this means for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threatening to spill into Europe.
This would be the case if copycats of this region ensured the exploitation of non-protected.
For example, a Chinese producer wants to table in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for the production company of footwear and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but she could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler added: "it is important to be vigilant."
Pattloch and advise him to the German companies a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough to rely on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should instead "Save also in China can be protected," said Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay a license fee to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler.
Or we will lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
On World Aids Day: kick, sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcomed their arrival.
This is the story of a link that passes much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, they type of the foot: the cowboy boots, sneakers, the pumps for the ladies and moccasins for men seeking the pace on the ground of the foot. very quickly, they are.
One, two, three, four.
Secondly, the voices of the singers are growing slowly - alto, tenor and soprano - they will prevail, and seems to follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses its canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with its wild gestures of flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the home.
"Om' Obani" is not an easy piece, each family has different words, all in an exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help themselves
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide have the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa."
70 of them attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, it can become godfather.
This guarantees the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storytelling" or "singer of praise."
Nobody can speak fluent the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeat of the songs in this foreign language that it has resulted in Germany for now make it to his native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village Esitjeni, which depends on the projection of the German choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 residents, some of whom live in modest straw huts or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV won their parents.
At Esitjeni, one can see smaller scale what ails Swaziland: HIV infection rates and the highest life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population is almost never accept male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of the Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a trip to group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. the Imbongis have seen many children in the street that was missing not only the parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without school diploma, there was simply no prospect.
In the beginning, there were just a few people who are personally committed to shed a few euros each year to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later, the choir based "Voices for Africa," an association that has been an almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What is the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STIs, syphilis, and gonorrhea chlamydiées gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, the human papilloma virus, the herpes or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic infections.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear among men who have sex with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sex between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five said in Germany.
Among adults, the heterosexual infections linked to the chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV infection among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. however, some 20% of new HIV infections are occurring within the group.
Among the young, there is a rate of infections linked to the chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the change in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory for all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of the genitalia, pain, urinary losses white, pain in the lower abdomen and the emergence of pimples and warts.
However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating Mediastinitis or narrow body contact.
The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing sexual partners to regularly review.
Most STIs quickly screened can be cured and the late effects can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorship, donations, but especially to the funds that are reaping the choristers thanks to their voices in Germany, the means to accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of themselves and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, one of their grandmothers for example.
The victims, so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive until 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that they go every day at the school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no person is allowed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare the meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a school of couture and allowed the construction of two barns. with the support of the American organization for health PSI, the association hosted a screening test for HIV for many people.
This is not automatic, because even if the disease is visible in all countries, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 13 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is an issue which affects sexuality."
This is rather odd, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These morals sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There is however condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh. "
In order to foster some cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi leave together traveling every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the black continent still face the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also snatched a tear to some formidable guards.
The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light," say the people there.
And after a trip to 8,733 miles as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, before these choristers who get the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Str., there is also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could reach 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains of frozen water, as explained three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science."
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shade.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters.
The water is probably derived from comets or asteroids that may have struck Mercury.
However, no one makes the connection between the discovery of water and the presence of life on the planet, "said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essentials to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Inaperçus of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such small cracks through which we see infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbit around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "babies" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars, called "W5," a romantic little, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years.
The NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a star dying.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she died.
In the vast nebula Trifide, 5,400 light years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades star cluster also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more colors in value.
In this photo, the Helix nebula of infrared, as a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarities with a terrestrial continent have earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo reveals a spectacular tinge.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have managed to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy focuses on the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace.
One of the photographs the largest and most net that has taken the Hubble telescope is that of the galaxy of Twister.
According to the hue, photographs of the galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the amorphous Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the heart shining in the birthplace of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic demolition derby in the constellation Ophiuchus: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush toward one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble has observed the birth of stars in a spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname of "wheel of Southern fire."
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula of Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebula is located 1,400 years away and is composed of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed pictures taken by various optical and X-ray telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes at 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy "GC 1810."
In this cloud is the group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are linked to the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there was that of the gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our eyes on the world's major telescopes:
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, Galileo before it screens a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror image on this had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, are using the Large Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias belly at La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter, reaches about 11 meters.
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which restricts mobility.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness lies in its ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in mirrors of the world.
The scientists listen to the universe in the search for alien signals from the radio telescope of (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI," or "search for alien intelligence"), using the power of his machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here lies the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors the telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. it will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not take the shots before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The telescopes are part of the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea who observed the sky with the Subaru Telescope and were.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This figure can be admired.
However, the images of the area's most important we come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, we book of images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5.
The first of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will notably task to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after bigbang.
Scientists believe the south pole of Mercury harbors ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory does not exist, because Messenger orbit far closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
The radar data indicated for decades the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to Reconnaissance Orbiter around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are reaching ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years.
The trip to the mountains Talysh is an unbridled romanticism.
The many turns of the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers torrentiels and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few kilometres.
It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which little is known, if only they are fluent in Farsi and Azeri and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne too aggressive with its architecture of the Soviet era, which is not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks in the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
One can discover the lives of approximately eight dozens of Talysh region will have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Having a child to 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than questionable.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and it would have been 23 children. at the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would wrong a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"A surprisingly older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence due to the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no registry.
Each day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is the fact that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explained that the Talysh have special genes.
By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, think it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and milk products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of the people? to Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground next to a churner, it beats the content.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children enjoy also in the house.
In the kitchen making tea for the guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of belly.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that his son tells us with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and thus I have never lost and they have kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She still ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then, she spoke of her husband who was in the military.
The worst moments have been after the Second World War.
But all has improved when the "Dear father Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has ruled his country as a dictator, does almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.
Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good living in the region.
And maybe the son of long greying Mirzayeva is right: "the seniors have great respect in our culture."
They are the centre of the big family, they are loved, and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" failed in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
A rival MANIFESTACIONES reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not mince words full of emotions.
We must manage the transition.
"And this is my responsibility to the people, and toward God," he said on state television.
His speech was aimed at the entire people, but also to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, Muslims and secularists.
Because all members of the opposition divided hopelessly confused and afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its business "in order to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world didn't really know what wants to save this engineer of 61 years, holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California.
The judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly Islamic majority of 100 people during a tour de force of 15 hours are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the law is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But that really means the word "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the margin for maneuver legal to implement a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case it is that suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters pertaining to the Sharia, Azhar University must be consulted. the establishment of Islamic institution is the largest in the country and his brilliance shines on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the military court.
During the reign of Hosni Mubarak, gives these courts to repress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, "reads the draft, protect" the true nature of the Egyptian family "and" promote their morals and values. "
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of the art cinema and literature.
Clearly, it would be a simple matter of censorship.
In addition, there are no articles explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offend or denigrating the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the rule does not define what is an offense or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people."
Suffit-il to draw a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi put to vote and who, in his own words, "very soon" will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.
"The revolution" manipulates
The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Cairo's Tahrir Square, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi launches, came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi of trying to foment a "coup against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and reversed," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have pledged not to monitor the referendum that involve its invalidity.
"The Koran is our constitution."
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people are asking for the implementation of the law of God."
"Our country!" shampoo, demandaient-ils to Morsi, saying that "the Koran [their] Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, spoke loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box of the direction the country.
The project of the Islamists will win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which should extend until February and encompass all social forces.
This human rights advocate of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had discovered the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he has been beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even uttered once in the new Constitution," therefore regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations to the rules of democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president takes off all its powers," deplores Saeda.
But a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.

The rakfisk of Norway: if the fish is the most fragrant world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the space for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Placez-les in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty football.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell of disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
It snows, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - according to the smell that you want it exhales - up to a year.
When darkness settles and it's cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen full-time local fireman, also known as "rakfisk General," responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and seem to be a large quantity of drink.
"Some people prefer the aquavit the rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting under your nose, this is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi chefs who have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water in the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once he is released, the fermented fish and - no doubt with the sense of diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In previous generations, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, higher wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, though, of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each.
Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to annoy him.
Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of 22 July."
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes transperçant, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a tray of rakfisk by hand.
We are - how do you say - people cautious.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discrete, we do not like us.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, has invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries laid money down the drain, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she says in a carefree laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I am the queue to buy food - I had my share of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a true discovery, it was excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I spent is one of the many places where it serves the rakfisk for dinner and where they can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the strongest scent of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wearing his trademark bowties, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
One would believe oneself in the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What have you given to score the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, looks at the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, of which there are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are rife in normal times, a dam security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access into the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to prevent people from reaching their workplaces, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the House.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task ahead of him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, results that outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a war on drugs that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A sprawling densely populated state and gripping the capital. on its stamping ground, opinions are divided on this new leader.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is etched in the memory of all.
The office attributed the development of tourism and infrastructure in the county.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, formerly bosselées and full of cracks.
A plaque bearing his name is attached to the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the Party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
This is a complete man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
This is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the autoponts highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, were found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the most violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face this reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fight to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported suicides by Mariana in 2010.
However, his family believe that she was killed by her partner.
"When I got home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed," tells the Lady Buendia.
A signs indicated that she had been beaten, and this was already underway.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall, next to a cross which uses the word: justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a birthday, a disorder pleurnicheuse.
They want you accept what they say and we remain silent.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico during the past six years and the new president has promised that he would make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope it will be as good as president when he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, Member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning had not complained of ill-treatment, state prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse including Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during the detention.
The trial focuses on Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have sought to demonstrate on Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about ill treatment that he allegedly suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. improved Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaint about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the case be classified Manning on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and was a severe enough punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During the hearing Friday, Fein has discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers posed questions to Manning and recorded her answers.
When Fein raised the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that has reserved his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had within the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do any complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly when asked about his treatment in prison, "said Fein.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded the issues raised.
"They have established" no problem "(after addressing the concerns), however, this does not mean that I had not caused any problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury."
The military reported that they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level below the closer surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to cut this status... to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and will be issued once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very stressful.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage," said Manning, on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent much of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also said that he had only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
He has tried to remain in motion, because sleep or reclining position during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woken up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning has been placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and others described a morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to cover it with a blanket during the appeal.
For questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said he had discussed the agenda of his warnings that it was dropping its coverage that could hide their nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered him to drop.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he allegedly tried to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his or her flip-flops to harm themselves, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that her underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences that he lived during his detention and that it would substantially reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted in a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defense has said that Manning intends to plead guilty to the less serious offences and fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who would argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules governing the detention of all prisoners at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense.
If all the charges are accepted, he could face life imprisonment.
My identity crisis mexico-américain
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are party; they remind Mexicans difficult periods, "he said.
Navarrette said that Mexico-américains are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby before the immigration and customs services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two tracks: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing where to turn leader.
I grew up in the central California, where I was called the "Mexican all my life."
It is an ethnic qualifier, in the same way that my friends in Boston use when they say 'Irish', or my friends in New York when they say 'Italian. "
Secondly, I became "Mexico-Américain."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the ground that has seen my grandfather, no need for special qualifier or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my accent.
So I took my American passport and I headed toward the file "foreigners."
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender in writing half of their territory at the barrel of a gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, once a U.S. official formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship the most difficult is that the country has with more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States.
You want it addresses the issue of bitterness?
There is a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and other for which the country cannot offer.
The only reason the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at the moment, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity to Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person was a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, we went in good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they alike, as if we were individuals from lower strain and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be party.
And we do not end up stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States but lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, I remember that there was friction between the Mexicans and Mexico-Américains, because the Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and Mexico-Américains are upset.
Although U.S. citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Américains I know do not have the impression of being part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we see as Americans.
And in the United States, we regard as Mexicans.
And now, complicating the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a country that must absolutely superb visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if we consider the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are present, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Nor will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
A further bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While remain the same arguments useful to know which began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has all shatters, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps their fight will increase even more.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help them to get out of this impasse.
A war that is no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of the strength of the two sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and deported the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded planet, Israel has not responded to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.
Turkey, a regional power booming, once its closest Muslim ally of Israel, has made a strong case for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Golf.
The members of Hamas are growing and saying that the Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most of the Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public.
Diplomacy in the future, Hamas may emerge as an important player who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, hardliners of Israel draw opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep at night - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the recent wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has thrived, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime ministry, which has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in terms of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud Party merged with a party even more hawkish leader, Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election on 22 January, a beautiful.
Why treat these doomed by giving them a Palestinian state?
If they ran the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring.
Even if the Islamists who took power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbors.
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is designed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains as advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small hope, and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to outsiders to champion the cause.
Egypt, who must now tackle to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to be united.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of cigarettes neutral came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and performances of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking of their parents.
Besides the different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small type on all packages.
This is the most stringent in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco.
The Australian government has said that the aim was to deter youth smoking by removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance they begin ever.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children associated the crown logo to a princess. "
Even if Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.
The tobacco manufacturers have said that it would reopen the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"A negative consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the cigarette cases, in particular, to mask the horrific Uncollapsed packaging, has strongly increased two months since that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost before the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to hide the cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online.
Australia has banned advertisements on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you are no more than a small storefront to promote your products, the Internet is par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in the contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of the brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves if there is a simple citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and who took the trouble to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have reported to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos of warning in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
A tougher laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos do not bother me.
I ignores them.
"You take a cigarette machines and the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package featuring a photo of cancer of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, this is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the heart of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to storage of packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload packages, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all, and we said OK, this is good, it stops and you put the key in the door," he added, lifting the arms to the sky.
In a world constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the period from Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I had plenty of time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - bored from time to time, they said.
This forces the brain to take interesting, even to nurture creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types of screens, we are not aware of the benefits of boredom.
Then we should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will return.
First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, "said Peter Toohey Greco, a professor of history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of" Boredom: a Lively History "(Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give the boredom.
The problem is that it has been found and destroyed, in different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After numerous publications and submitted the idea in a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have described the boredom as an experience that is "trying to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity."
What makes the boredom of apathy, "he says," is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like.
With apathy, "he says, it is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, it is "the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a sullen mood and feel that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when in fact it is a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV show that had no report, others have just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group has not all heard the soundtrack.
Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more worried than the other two groups - they have struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task, or taking a break from the attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, when you make a tedious task, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you do not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that when it wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn more and waving retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We're bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight of aircraft, a speaker with a voice lacking in sparkle, a film particularly annoying.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a scale "predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have the time to do it all."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, including need many and varied stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored in school and for homework at home, while 23 percent said they get bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of the parents reported getting bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew "adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level," particularly because the children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I based my question: boredom is good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, placing bets or abusing substances to pass the time, as studies show.
By contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way that the brain was found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the right thing to do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
If your child is bored and give him an iPad, it will miss most, but he will not have learned to handle alone nor autorégler, said Professor Fenske.
And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I do not think we should criticise.
Feel at ease outside the constant ferment that generate the activities and technology is the goal toward which we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get more often, but the boredom awakens a frenetic and acute desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy the time of arrest.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, was indicted for something that will soon become legal in his state: the meatballs possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After that the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for drug possession and material that could be used to its consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a court appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it a?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote from Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving drug use a low depends more on the place of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were shelved.
The police force has ceased to indict adults over the age of 21 for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are in the most conservative of the Colorado have called to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to charge the persons who possess them.
Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of western vote now to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"Things are moving so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators from the state of Washington will also pose a few questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulation on marijuana, firstly regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could build on," he said.
The law of Washington, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a gap of a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana is illegal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees adequate access to marijuana approved and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis within a radius of 30 kilometers around a school, a park, a playground or a kindergarten.
"There will be no more difficult than urban areas to install a registered trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (the public prosecutor) would do more people aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charge people for this type of offence "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
To Weld County in northern Colorado, "district attorney" (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users to detoxify.
At the moment, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those who have committed a crime which, at the time, was an offence recognized," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions have been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favour of the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest town in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.
The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, argued that decision, but decided not to drop all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework appropriate government and personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials as regards the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws "(National Organization for the Reform of the laws on marijuana).
"They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute those who smoked marijuana, therefore, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and representatives of the state provide a new frontier of legalized sales, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which designs always sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will break.
Despite some high-profile arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police is not likely to depress the doors to pick up small packets of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes the shops licensed to sell marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy advisor to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities were not waiting for the federal authorities act.
Before the vote, some local governments have adopted moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a year's delay.
Last week, the town of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should enforce the ban next week.
"We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we faced a federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the state.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of joining the University of Oxford.
My father and my elder brother have studied in what seemed to me a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study the history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that students from the first round had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink cups chipped.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been intimidated and the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I had a private school.
I have been persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly influential advised Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why mention it today, maybe.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-students of the same type of persecution.
The growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, in the same way as those gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the student lounge (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College reported that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and undesirable SENTÍAN" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the Committee of the university for equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("wonderland: young, intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the policy among students, and which dépeignait "Tories" as the eccentric and the Nazis.
It was mentioned specifically the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), "which moves in a silver Rolls-Royce, complete and moves with a cane to shiny head.
In other universities, the conservative students said they would be treated as scapegoats for the implementation of rising tuition fees. "
Luke Black, 20 years, Vice President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a newspaper Sunday that" there is a growing left in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR towards those who are centre.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of the intellectual debates, as well as to the welfare of the members," she said.
I was the only one to think this way during my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, when I was 18 years of age and a crippling shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very slow.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week, when the new students have knowledge with other teachers, and I had a foretaste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm toward students Tory, but that they were taking pleasure.
It was as if the policy regarding the striking miners, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved in wood from classrooms.
The first sarcasm that I was the victim was a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost his footing.
Pitt, a small man in the face, easily outstrips pustular.
"Does the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
Other students have laughed.
The tears I burned the eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched a truculent tone.
I returned to my room, inconsolably.
During the dinner tonight, I am sitting alone and then I felt a tap on my shoulder.
This was a student in his second year of studies of English, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I am afraid that it does.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting.
It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory purport to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I carelessly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students echoed the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories do they love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, isn't it? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Do you only able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Do you were forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Do you had become Labour and disown my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatoire ostracism and isolation.
The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speech.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view of the marxiste-déterministe history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"Thou shalt not be happy here," he said.
I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends dwellers more open-minded.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
It was disbelief.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They do not do that, not in the city to the ladies dreamers.
Even my friends had impeccable communist ways.
He had tears in her eyes.
Laisse-leur a chance.
I am sure this is for teasing.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a meeting of work led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the utmost seriousness, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Rougissant internally of shame, I accepted to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and traitai them "old crazy."
The respite was short-lived.
This is my father who has pressed the last nail in my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed back and forth in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned.
When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I am never returned.
You can also treat me of chicken.
But no child of 18 years should not be a victim of such bullying in school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also benefits from an unshakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance to notoriety."
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona and other celebrity clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture," a retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house during the last 50 years.
"I love it," he said, with its inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story, "he is the only player signore" Garavani, but that could not be established without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Marie-Chantal of Greece and Princess Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: the fashion designer of the small town of Voghera, northern Italy, the idol of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong to love the royalty.
"At least, they do not their cigarette butts on your splendid carpet like pop stars," said Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza Fiona.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We erect all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad," says the former wife of "Heini Thyssen," close friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The Argentine supermodel Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decor, the food, the music.
"With him, each guest was important and appreciated," recalls the "Top Model," which began to work with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It never ends, because his creations are works of art," termine-t-elle.
Parade of noble lineage
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but loves shared.
He likes the people very high and with the greatest titles and they love him, too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour of sixty meters wide which proposes exchanging roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must scroll on the podium to admire a "public" dream of bearing the main creations of Valentino, as the suit that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the public of mannequins, Organoarsenicals names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Abascal Naty and designer in 2006
Many of his clients say the first Valentino clothing are like first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember well.
It was a pair of pants, shirts, jackets "gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection of 1971 / 72.
"This is a gift that I had done," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the couturier.
"I prefer to all others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it sublimates our beauty," adds the ex-duchesse.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and Patricia Della Giovampaola modeuse d'Arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time that she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and was living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his gowns for evening...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening gown with a flowing skirt, a bustier draped neckline and a fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," says the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the evening dresses of the couturier with "the utmost care, because an evening gown is not only a dress, she is also all the memories that she vehicle."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress worn Marie-Chantal Miller married Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the designer called his seamstresses) to achieve this silk dress with inlays of ivory beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half metres behind.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of haute couture to the end of the 20th century, "the return of the high-society."
Obnubilé for years by the "skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani became more honoured than any of her husband.
"Its refinement, its calm, well-perfect and I have always been clear to me," acknowledges d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friend.
"It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If this is a princess who said...
The trade the harshest in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, holders of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who are literally working in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living by wearing the sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in air.
Having reaped big rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of nearly 70 kilograms, it installs them in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude porters exhausted, but more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that a misstep could cost them the life, as happened in a French tourist who had such a fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extract.
Once on top, it spawned a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and bearing the heavy baskets, they marched 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, you might say, its employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and being used to launder the sugar.
"As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto, who performs in general three trips per day.
It takes 3 hours and exhausted, but it allows him to win some 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a human misery for such an effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the holder who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto income is close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, coughs constantly breathes with difficulty, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas.
At 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started to pay the bill although it covers the face with a mask and bears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, coughs constantly breathes with difficulty, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
This is the price that must be paid to pursue his dream.
"I will work even two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French promet-t-il English in a" more than acceptable.
Battered by life, engaging and intelligent young could be tourist guide, server or in a hotel receptionist, but, instead, it is the work of a mule.
He shares a wooden hovel tainted with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop gushing at night, when his characteristic yellow colour becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
The Gender, Anto darkness descends into the crater is illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load of sulphur baskets on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanised extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to holders who work on their own and are paid to the weight.
Moreover, they are not under the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park billed the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not humans," protests Madrusin corpulent porter, a 42-year-old who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left for college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, ensures that it will not work "as long as he can," because it needs money to raise her three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the tide is turning and the miners trapped in thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains of suffering serious diseases... in addition to their usual Obliviously respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years, can only charge 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano that three trucks in the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 miles away by a trail of goats overgrown by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," says Unainik opening your mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
As time passes, but the misery for generations the most difficult in the world: those that are human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore search for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans cast the responsibility of this lack of children on the career, the stress and the cost of ownership.
"The people of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, fulfil our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint tablets, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The lyrics from a rap group that uses local references as "will put a referendum in the drawer" to mock the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hope to draw attention to the problem of fun with this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to the people "their national duty."
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that this was an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to pheromones or organize speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they may not have worked.
We therefore said the following: what could be more creative in solving this problem as a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore did not take more seriously.
He spends 1,300 dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers pays up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich and high technology from southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the replacement rate, it was in 1976.
So why the Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says that this is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the establishment of a family," she says.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and to delay marriage and the births, which has resulted in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at sharply increasing immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites that moves a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore enjoyed last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small homes.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments are 46 square meters and their sale won much success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a lifestyle of Célibataires and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than the larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines to proponents, who previously put a spanner in the works if they wished to propose too small in a housing project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step toward increasing the national birth rate in discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people might start later," said a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young twenty years.
The men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, it is the women themselves who have the last word.
What is private is private online and offline
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private or "area of privacy that we can protect any intrusion."
That est-ce-qui is the private domain for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and social networks?
Comprend-il the dangers to which they are exposed in Internet events that he does not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they have linked the term "something very personal" and "the password and user name" when they have applied to social networks.
"I do not without giving away my personal secrecy in a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the Private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years.
"They are very secretive secret, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
I post on FB, images of the fun and games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I will not share one of my photos or someone who could make a fool," he said.
The boy recognizes that it was wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on Facebook and its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
His mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting.
"I don't know if I was them, I just position," he said.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly," he said.
He says that he would never accept the application of an unknown person.
It will not do not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of Jose, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on this last, he admitted that he did not know 20 of the people included on its list of friends.
"I don't worry because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, nobody has made advances nor requested her address or phone number.
"If they gave me the pressure or demanded supprimerais them, I just in my account," he acknowledges.
José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the boy.
A relative of one of my friend was bullied on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he stressed.
The victim, according to Jose, has not closed his account.
"It has only happened in private profile."
We then explains a series of manipulations to configure its account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in situations uncomfortable or embarrassing.
Yes, I'd do if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know that this is the cyberharcèlement," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and Bachelor of Education and Learning, considers that to steer children and adolescents, we must understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed," she says. "
Porras said that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and digital immigrants," uses these words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We, the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are in the process of learning," she says.
He adds that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite attitude on what he needed or not disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the necessary maturity."
"We also call on them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she says.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the privacy of children and adolescents is to use issues that they are sobering.
"Tell them not to do nothing," she says.
Secondly, Porras lists some examples: there are things that you would not be telling a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?
Or, you see that they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published?
Sais-tu what others publish on you?
When you identifies photos of festivities, about the other people permission to identify them?
And also, everyone needs to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational adviser, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.
With each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we must not talk to foreigners.
The summit of the Unasur ended without the Declaration of Lima is made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency reported at the outset that he would be released after the close of the summit, then said that it would be published from time to time on the website of the Peruvian government.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access to information about the summit has constantly been limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, audio restricted" was published in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists were those given by the press secretary to some of the governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important news.
Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that has reached the summit.
Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd Summit of the Arab American Sud-Pays (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been applied with the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published in March.
In the two international event, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems to secure transmission for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information.
The Summit also concluded with a joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at regional meetings and declared that they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear from the parties in the lawsuit that was brought against Santiago and Lima that begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect the verdict and implemented will resolve disputes that we have today in this international court," said President Humala his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international courts," added the President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after that Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua regarded it as seriously flawed.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Rouseff, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he said that the countries of the Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship through the development of agreements on the residence permit."
He informed that action would be put in place to improve the "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for a better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triumphalist but should help increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples," concluded the President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, particularly in rural areas and cross-border pooling our country... and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian president in a speech.
Among these, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the underlying themes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its integration within the Union of South American Nations," which it is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America is a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another issue at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday to Mexico to calmly discuss maritime dispute through the ICJ ruling requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these routes, they are not comprehensive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua is going to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible," added the President Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the transfer of power to the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet prior to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn how to integrate Europe a citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should follow the example of Europe."
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, stretching from TV, that Europeans "were killed each other during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he described the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"We must reach the free movement of citizens and workers in any country in South America, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the president of Ecuador has shown for the restoration of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the goal of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who you will never compromise, on the other hand, we, the South, have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said that he does not regret his decision, because it does not itself has betrayed its principles, but he instead met its "deep democratic values and human rights."
It concluded that at the time, "there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected."
Moreover, he criticizes the Swedish justice who demanded that it puts on its territory to an interrogation concerning an alleged sex crime while "own Swedish legislation can do so by videoconference, what could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had had a lung problem, but nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of anyone," he says.
Correa said that the solution of granted asylum to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a safe conduct that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he stressed that he had had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings from various European bodies," he said.
And he believes that "if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as the makes it completely its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or being interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that it was "not tolerated mediocrity, bad faith and the lies that interfere with the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians or malicious perverse but bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this light, it welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador," and instead of putting forward his re-election, "he approfondirait the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should stand firm and not Tolerating opportunism and the attempted coup in disguise," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
What is more, the president of Ecuador as "entirely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a country and a South American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
We must resolve them together to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said that it is "beneficial that Latin America understands the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a firm judgment if it."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa has ensured that, if he lost the primary to February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations that are as unfair as those of Ecuador, the socio-economic poverty can only be solved through the political power.
"My political movement was believed that it was me who ensured that possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from politics.
If we lose, I will.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, Cuba.
I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security.
The AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man has hidden from his family.
He decided to take one of his illness and began to inquire about him and his determination was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV civil hospital in Guadalajara (hCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
Even then, the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say hello to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still when the virus has already caused the damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported case, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the unit of HIV of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologue and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed the patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for people do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those at a rate of 500 CD4.
Put simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis in 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years," explained the scientists interviewed.
To put it in context, it should know that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average.
If it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients were on the national database died.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why is there still of death?
I think the problem is not with access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never failed to drugs, the problem is that the patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they do not know they are infected, or when they learn in advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is conducting earlier diagnoses and, for that, it must offer testing, to all who request them."
The specialists and the members of the Council of State of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves as Fabrizio, who had to make its screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying the AIDS and Kaposi's Sarcoma, a cancerous tumour which is one of the complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some believe that they will die and don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke three times per week," they say, this is not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, her parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsible, I pay attention to me and to the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share its Intimité with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who fear today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.
Do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are positive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they should know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gap between health and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we gave packets of 100, which is fine, but the result, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections were teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do?" asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at the counters, but they were found in the distributors of public toilets and where the young.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
Nor is it to pay them the girls and the motel, as had reduced the Governor Emilio Gonzalez when he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how it works sexuality, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV listing).
The state is the fourth state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of HIV infections are sexually, 6% through the blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, as for each recorded cases, there are four or five people who do not know him.
A judgement ratified on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro granted via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. the scenario causes a negative precedent for all transnational corporations with influence in neighboring countries and having solvency problems.
It seems that the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the starry banner, field of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment of 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to enter the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of the insolvency of businesses with a national profile.
In fact, the law of the Model United Nations Feel the Commercial Law International had been established for this purpose by the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgement stated that without the vote intersociétés, recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries of the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here there is a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of the Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, because there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, of all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A fact omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis that confronted the United States, reflecting the costs to the country.
For now, the family society González Sada interjettera appealed to the same court of appeal for the vote to be held in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance and reclaim non-prospérité requires a retrial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on corporate bankruptcy, noting that the freed up agreements signed by the two countries to reach the same level as in paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
In addition, he noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set out for the cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pile-up of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they shocked the country.

Héctor "Hetin Reyes'" basketball is my life. "
The showing of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin Reyes."
The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage was condemning the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, the OBS, with Vaqueros from Bayamón or as chairman of the basketball federation.
"I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the Federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes did not exaggerate when he made that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that recall his itinerary, witness.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all her memories, those he loves the most are those that remind its passage as the player within the team of Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, those for which I am most benefited because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, either as manager, co-manager or leader.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team, "said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here, and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a big player for you, measuring two meters.
You want it? "
This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was a better shots.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had resulted in Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.
He welcomed the championship with Gausse Vaqueros, but only at a distance since 1988 it was already the honcho of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hasn't been playing the last game, said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World is the best national team that you view?
It is one of the best, like that which beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have taken a beating in the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all predictions.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.
That was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Having been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the OBS employed up to 17 teams in a season.
You can do?
There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce play only in their area and are the only teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff spots.
Today, the youth travel and play too when it is not necessarily needed.
I've at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attended a basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side.
The actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became internationally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous businessman, formidable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role ironic that he loved the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it will greatly miss.
"It was an exceptional person and he lived life in substance," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver to Larry Hagman in 1992 and admitted he had drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected a malignant liver and he had undergone a liver transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman had made known to television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams," broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Capt. Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius attractive, played by Barbara Eden, and he brought it home.
He also played in two comedies that have remained little time to the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the movies, there are roles well received by critics in the "Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously stable J.R. that Larry Hagman underwent its greatest success.
The CBS drama series of the Ewing clan and their relatives ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "who killed J.R.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record audience at this time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers on average were in front of their screens and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "Mash" celebrations in 1983, which had collected 50 million viewers.
This was the sister of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. Raashidoon pregnant and had threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people had also reasons to attack.
Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a man and insatiable but charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and a faithful husband who tried to confine his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would be like epitaph for Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here are the only party that he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste from the original series, recalled Hagman Friday as a man of "immense, both on the small screen as in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the channel TNT made on how will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the celebrity with classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first step on the scenes of the theaters of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoir "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': the ruthless memories of Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm)
"I have nothing written in this book that might hurt someone or affect it in any way," he said to the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients worried.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to be operated on and after," he says in 1996.
I try to give them a bit of comfort, as "fear not, this will not be easy for a moment, but this could go well."
It has also been campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course of the "end of the world" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the NDG, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he launched an irresistible hook: the end of the "Great count" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited them over the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian thinkers of the end of the time thought to trigger the apocalypse.
"I never realized that it would be half the apocalyptic more than I've ever seen," said Professor Charmé this week to his students from the Université Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we already told, this has been a very good period.
And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it is not the only teacher to teach courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the story.
Temple, an assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption "media, culture and end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the NDG, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios to guide a certain human conduct.
If the nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, could be a war.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropologie, have teamed up to teach a course simply entitled "the end of the world."
"We add" 2012 "to have the chance to offer the course again, if the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the looming disaster, "students must study, create projects and spend their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student choice other than to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The course proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about its course for students of high level, composed of 35 students.
We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the share of people who asked if there was still space.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are capable of doing to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23, of Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether religious or secular, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Wekesa Will, a student in Psychology and nurse for 25 years, claims to have viewed the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a professor, told us believe in the end date of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," says Julie zegle, a student of last year at Temple, 21 years of age and from West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I admit that there is an anxiety-related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he stressed.
The majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded when asked if he knew that we gave here courses on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines are not at the end of the world," we responded, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, we have talked about the supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or to philosophize on the fact that the 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
The students and teachers took the date lightly.
Several have told us that they thought they were going to parties "to the end of the world."
"Sometimes, I called friends and we rigolons together," said Samira Ford, a student communications from 20 years ago.
