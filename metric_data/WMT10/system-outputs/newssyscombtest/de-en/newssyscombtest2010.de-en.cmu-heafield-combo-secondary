Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose runways Sorgenn not only the giant mountains - residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and the New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid, binding.
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or " Matsch " will be the operator of the Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura.
The New Year's Eve stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners offer now for the Silvestertag mostly just weeks stays.
I think that they are still try to sell it for a time, but then they have to give, and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will be quickly, Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by bad that no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year without snow in the mountains.
Should be verschneit the runways within a week, will also be sold out the Christmas, says.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, manages to fill the rooms in the hotel in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in the Janua, and in February, the business will also run well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve visits is also the Omnia hotel in zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne.
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment, when the snow comes, is increasing the interest in the Giant, the director of the hotel, Erik Sporysch.
On a more snow mess for the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday, it should cool and if it rains, the snow on the mountains.
But then again, a warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, which for the most stupid.
When he finally his eagerly - awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it is that he showed on the Kopierpapier from the Bush - Iraq three years ago.
Not only that, in the text itself, he repeatedly used the phrase " as in Iraq, he has even the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: " new Vorwärtsweg " without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as " irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision ".
Subsequent months showed that the recommendations of the military strategy, the only possible and was very successful, that people today in the news about Iraq.
Bush's reputation has not improved, because he has left his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have again asked the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The President has three months, but no better idea and he has the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000, even though he himself.
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete the process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraq is relatively well - structured, honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - it can rely on no one and there are no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, that leaves only buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The building of a " strong state ", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries broke out on the " Homecoming " is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents, in what way the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush Gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question of whether or not to solve the problem with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, would prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses more in cash
The chief executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year more bonuses in cash.

Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts to link the premium Wall Street bonuses with long - term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion for bonuses set aside.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today despite the measure exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, the 25,000 pound with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

Ministers Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received on Friday morning, the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form of this by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet in the issues of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which deepened the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On its future remain in his post will Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget bill, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals on money and the money for the civil servants ' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the official cabinet, on the design of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures imposed by the fischer - government in the fall, and the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but need not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the " serious problem " that " the unsustainable deficit " of public finances, have been neglected for a long time.
In his view, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, led that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a " strong worry. "
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek - words that the budget deficit is that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film " Invictus: the Ungeschlagene " of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar - actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: " If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the from the Boxbereich " million dollar baby ", the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, the slave owners, to a fictional US president, and also in " Evan Almighty God ", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active career in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to undfür four years he has been President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
" Invictus " is the Latin word for ungeschlagen ", and at the same time, is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to some of the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still and economically divided.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, in the world.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela - history on the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so this as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have noticed that when I say, schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, as he Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I rang the door bell that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: ' in the film, I see a lot more from '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actor in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood " Invictus: Ungeschlagen " received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: " That was a very good story, very well ausgeführter film. "
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes. com, has Invictus 76 percent positive assessments.
Light secret dissolved on Norway: the Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was not successfully and as a type " Bulava " missile which was originally the pride of the Russian army, is becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or have been damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers on " Bulava " than a ", which flies. "
A missile, which flies, but do not
This was already 13 attempt at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time, " Bulava " from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp enables the firing from the submarine.
It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified fliegendes object on Norway was actually the damaged " Bulava. "
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals has diesesmal challenged and claims that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without error, the head of the Verteidigungsministeriums only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The nearly 50% success so the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the " Bulava " even without problems and even to ten Hyperschall nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance, which is also in gestählten ' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds, which are intended to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants is not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
But their income is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the development sg. Resistentviren, against the no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, from the VSCHT (chemically - technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how to deal with the virus - resistant.
They have proven that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane substance, which is responsible for the expansion of the HIV Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new ' improved ties, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein substance.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three - dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV - caused by the HIV virus would not mature Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work, in the Science paper was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples cages (see table) by a brief organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested in Reagenzglas, even against their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV - infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Institute for the National Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as " terrifying " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a " strong worry. "
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei left - wing party - more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the Budgetprovisoriums. Frase not clear
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government's assessment of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
The fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Social Democrats (CSSD) , the changes in the budget had nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit - boosting laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the law should be changed.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were not
That is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the government.
The ODS nominated ministers have made no mistake, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people sit to top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen in favour decides to the fight against the deficit of public finances, " it is completely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority in Parliament ".
He Then allegedly with the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak said the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the would explicitly ask that they enable the adoption of the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all positives, Topolanek itself.

With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional rail: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transport, as a whole, the railway to reimburse the so - called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kronor in has this year. local trains provide the districts, the next year, eight billion kronor, while the state three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains has completed the railway a ten - year contract, until now, the Treaty was only for a year.
The railway praises the system, it is not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
To changes, it is only in one - day Netzfahrscheinen CD Net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card will be the price CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will depend on the drive was, until now, it has been claimed for travel between any bezirkstädten uniform and 160 kroner.

Jancura makes criminal proceedings for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, criminal proceedings for libel against three social - democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the region Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions have signed but ultimately the long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three heads us and say that we take the cherries, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said the radio Journal.
At the same time, he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for the continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura it as free advertising for his company and for his own person.

The campaign has launched Jancura after the districts at the behest of the regional rail transport with the Czech railways and for the task in a High 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender.
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and inconsistent with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.

He was a Member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I am not saying his name, said the radio Journal today.
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now the floor votes that would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken.
The medicine institute already set the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free Vaccines for August - children
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition st that they have not received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccine in the last year or earlier, must also pay for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be between 3 and 5 month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses of 300,000-450 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment, which would need the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children around 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so - called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die in our investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty - vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be in the future.
From January to paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, which was involved in our union, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky led.
The Department of Health wants but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken change.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of vaccination number " in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this is a voluntary, " says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents their infants against Pneumokokken from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this was the first flächenimpfung is paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical children doctors, the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and doctors received in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some Members feared that the insurance so " the money from the health insurance could lead ".
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance companies pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum of money.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Islam Can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on building minarets and the widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: " Why do the French love " (original title: " Why the French Don't Like Headscarves ") (2006) , an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, which divided the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening on the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls " Islamic free " offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City hall (or both
Young Muslims Should be lectured about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman Can marry a non - Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest - oriented banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well - known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss - born Arab Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed Bowen, are with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia, which is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
He queries whether French political makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism.
He sees a " tightening of the screws " as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say " yes, but not yet. "
The bleak outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and takes life that can survive anywhere else.

Bewandert in the complex history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14 - year - old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle his Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, which, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today Zooanlagen typically still have a millionth of the life of wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his skin.

Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two hunting nations the ice longest remain.

Marines were among the 6,000, the Arlington placed wreaths laid down
The Obergefreite De ' Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to lay a wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are.
In a few months, from where we are, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would hope someone would do the same for me, so I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.

It is now an 18 - year - old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make the trip each year in various cities along the route to events, the people in the military and are paid to victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non - profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed wreaths across America) , the event has extended to other states.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the National cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150,000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we civilians can support our soldiers.
It is as the visit of a family tomb.
Were Wrapped in warmer clothes the volunteers across the vast lawn and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, since these are not as often as the newer graves, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine branches on the grey grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper part was attached.
The section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations across 1,000 placed wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and family and friends kept each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names written in stone, while others are too small black and white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet ready.

The US government contractors by Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has a contractor to the US government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, working for Development alternatives, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of " risk can be arrested.
All so - called counter - revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti - government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a " slow " approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government taking concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of government employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has allowed ordinary citizens this year the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, as a 15 - minütiges phone call would cost a daily wage.
The Internet use is restricted on the island.
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect their names, often the government.
Too many websites is restricted access.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other free society - the tax free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, " which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title " new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants very often within a day, were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill, and said that they hope that this case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA plot to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north - west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to try to get the right advice in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of five men - which remains in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiting in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, in deciding who is to be trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11 2001, has made it a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Gangmasters act as guardians of the organization, not those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would - be recruits from A Qaeda a specific test, analysts said.
Because of their potential access to US and its propaganda value, but they are also seen as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, Chief analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years have become much more cautious about whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow, which so many have already followed? , said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate " Action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre in the city of kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, in English, " there is no Planet B " and one in Spanish, which declared that " the world says ' enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of their birth mother, her heart has to with the type of problems the country because of the effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to take part in the large demonstration - pass to the floor and appeal to the world leaders to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around the results.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are banned during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, burned several explosive devices in black clothes in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main channel, near where several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the building, he said, and added that it began as a Leuchtraketen, but by " a few large explosions ".
On the inside of the Congress Centre people gathered from television screens to watch the whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: " This is something that I was not even aware of. "
He then in Mandarin and said: " because of the venue is great, I can hear what is happening out there. "
He noted that from the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, " we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people ".
Test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District of Washington is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the evidence shows that the Viert in the last two years, faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , their African - American counterparts, but only three points from 209 at 212.
In reality, the performance gap between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African - American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell to a statistically significant point of 245 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture over a six - year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202) .
And although the score, the children of both groups, has grown in that time span, the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district last week expressed its concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D. C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D. C..
I will not for a span of two or three points, and, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we always see the positive signs, I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend the time and energy that we use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson - reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading not at the beginning of their school career
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth - class games and real life experience to the fore, was under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP, which reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit from the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and the extra money and resources for the weak schools which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D. C..
The objective could create political fallout work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the achievement gap, the traditional public school year, which currently in Washington to 180 days, in order to compete with the charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers ' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called " a milestone " on the road to a major increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg - College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars of ziegelsteinfassaden and smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela had also been recovered in silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, was more of a full visitor, rather than the future students.
" Yes, I will soon be here! " Shouted Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
" Wow, really? " she said, as the low professor - to - student ratio of the school reported.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children on their three - day tour and now they have included the intended message: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School end or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of the college education, which is needed in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these " second generation " of Hispanoamerikaner the college - which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States, without the High School.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advice programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low - income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help the Wegsuche through the system, then a single measure at any will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We have to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre - school through the High School.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas college tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR up - a date hochschalten - and is more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college - preparation programs to launch the start, if low - income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school.
According to the US Department of Education has helped the program since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday in two major oil companies can get to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have shares in only two of the 10 auctioned for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American oil companies in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers a long time in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably is more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state - controlled energy company, and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the contracts with the ministry.
Major U. S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state - owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other companies with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, the spokesman said the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big players of the world economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field on the current level.

The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Oath redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed the development of Afghan security forces and will send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
This commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will not resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon now, so that they have time to look for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, in accordance with UN has started the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish - Italian - descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean - Marie Guéhenno, the previous UN peacekeeping operations has taken into consideration.
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, " the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because it is already a great deal of scepticism the international interference in the election ".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid of the American - led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I May, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon " significant additional sanctions " on Iran, because he has not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U. S. soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
" One of the things that are on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit. "
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a " package of positive and negative incentives " is necessary " in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons in reality, less " because " their people are suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with " credible " consequences if its nuclear programme to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme, and a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much - needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran appears to have but since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreement in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Iran, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, simply has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran have never, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called " crippling sanctions ".
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday, " gratuitous and unfundierte allegations " of certain members of the Security Council called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to talks with the United States and five other world powers in order to reach an appropriate long - term solution. "
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before it in the oil - rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August to 50,000.
Gates also sought to allay the Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal of troops. US Representative quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: " We will your security, your wealth and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters, the lecture that " mother earth is too tired to talk to other children " and " one more baby means one more tomb. "
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: " under no circumstances ".
We have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is nothing more, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 - month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern, who affectionately called " little emperors ", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department of population issues, while the number of the population 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent to This is well above the global average of 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 years and older almost 22 percent of reported residents while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, the head of the Shanghai population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to help the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future ".
Shanghai will soon " as old -- but not so rich -- such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A gradual easing
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy would be the most controversial, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her triple annual salary in some regions and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese state officials have attributed to this policy, the critical demands on natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples have had to carry out sex - selective abortions, which an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their stance on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently even more radical changes to allow, for example, two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July, the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, belehrten family, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how we can apply for the permit.
The city government has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural town in the outside areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the requests from couples to see after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts reported no change.
In the municipality with a population of 115,000, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West the one - child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would like to just one child, because she was also a Einzelkind. " We were the focus of the family and that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not really want to do this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 - year - old, a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39 - year - old grew to see their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- " we must rebuild his home " -- and the -- " if the child is 9 months old, have a CV for the best schools. "
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The UN - sponsored climate conference which until now by wild postures and has set on Friday with the publication of a document for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special UN working group, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be short and long term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging countries limit their carbon emissions and how much should be the upper limit of the global rise in temperature, the political decision - makers.
The process will be a great deal of flexibility, John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted the six - page document, a 180 - page negotiating text in order to focus on what the leading representatives of the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer described as " the big picture ".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions in the same period 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent.
The talks on Friday, the European Community has also given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, said that the leading US climate negotiator either " common sense " or " highly irresponsible " of him was that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States, China would not help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers who bear the costs of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants say that the talks in the best - case will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning a 24 - page draft treaty.
Artur Runge - Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, " political pressure on the whole political process, " in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues must be resolved before the arrival of the government leaders to reach an agreement.
High - level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese vice Minister entstiegen their aircraft and through the corridors of the meetings behind closed doors and press conferences during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly, 13,000 people daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late - night shows, in which they are making fun of the betray and sell, and draft will be passed from hand to hand rather than by e - mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: almost all the important ministers are now here and will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defines the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a. m., 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a zugabfahrt, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high - speed commuter train in the country with his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin - commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could be vibrant commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and concerns about environmental damage to the British high - speed tracks still the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2) , a company based in January, the government should submit a feasibility study Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next stage of the high - speed rail network.
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site is the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, nordwärts leading high - speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y - shaped route, in which a single high - speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
" It seems to be the most viable option, " said a railways insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London - Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals offer the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km/h, which the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of people can travel to.
Up to 18 trains per hour on the London - Birmingham could be in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed, could be processed on the 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high - speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan, in his opinion, should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections.
The trains would have to switch from the high - speed lines on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, and the journey time between London and Scotland would be about three hours.
This is seen as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be a beacon for the rail revolution.

Although the court the admissibility of the complaint would have to check by Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his Klientin at their sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) , in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane Bettencourt following added: " could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, once or twice a day to Banier wrote.
Françoise I have since their marriage never more ".
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " is fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, " the representative of the prosecutor, Marie - Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt - Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of consumers from the marketing revolution: it is For the staff to join " values " determines the best, as it was earlier in the consumer - products of the technicians in the station.
By customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected.
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R& Eund, what is even more crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) " of all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision "; it by the staff, which the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff of the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers.
The very - related benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately, not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure with a new situation after many detours, finally, to do ... what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which was recently by the American " neuroscience " and unknowingly far - reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the " leverage " (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le Figaro. fr survey by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure
Instead, for the smooth operation of the modern business the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any idea or practice of steering a fundamental minutes: for the wage - earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can predict the executives of the companies ' social performance and anticipate and human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the harmonious development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the " just war " Obama praise from the law
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize to the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the President, the example of the former vice - presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a " necessary " war in its newly published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in have done a very good job ".
I found that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to " the existence of evil in the world, " in the words of Obama's recognized.
In some parts of habeich this speech seen as historic, Ginrich said in the radio show " The takeaway " has been questioned.
The previous members by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to see a " president of the left " to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee that they were " not free and not for peace, if the use of force would not exist. "
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has " a very American speech ".
In addition, that he is a " Kosmopolit ", as he always does, " he said, " as an American president, " as he pointed out that the Europeans " as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection, and they do not much, " Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as " boring, pompous and inspirationslos. "
To the left of the President of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Verpackt the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent, as a " monumental ".
The speech in Oslo " offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression, " the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama " the necessary discourse " and described his speech as " bleak and exemplary " at the same time.

The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension by the minister for the entire profession.

New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, as " Russian Silicon Valley. "
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of the Frankfurt Innovation centre (FIZ) .
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt signed a " protocol on closer cooperation. "
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for technology, the big corporations and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so - called " socialist plan city " for the defence research.
Selenograd (literally translated as " green city ") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply " the new heart of Europe ".
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper a train station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of Baden - Württemberg capital for a decade in chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks in the middle of the city, was seen at the time as a technical fossils of the 19th century, as bremsklötze of a modern rail transport, since it took a lot of time, locomotives from behind.
In short, to go further.
And that is why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about half - way through the trans - European rail main route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - so the slogan of " heart of Europe ".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city is almost impossible to implement the Tiefer.
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since there are modern locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 and the ICE - neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians have.
The train with power, because the risks of the largest of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
Städtebaulich the project is still reasonably justified.
It creates new city area, which is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the development are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low - cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is not because of intense climbs for freight trains.
Much more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
What is clear is that in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and Engstellen the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 - kilometer route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
Is urgently needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke is the real bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.

Quick election
It was then everything faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board, the editor - in - chief Nicholas Brender had pushed out, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As the favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studios in Berlin.
There was A confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to the procedure.

With the argument, Brender had lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, he rejected another term of the highly regarded chief journalist.

Nothing came of it.
The person

The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday by the journal medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the board of directors, the Rhineland - pfälzisch Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said in the last week, the countries should change the ZDF state treaty so that the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of ZDF however.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move by the body immediately after the criticized.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence it was both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic, the left - wing liberal anyway.
Study will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday at a meeting of Ministers of culture and conference, both sides agreed to improve conditions in the studies Bachelor and master.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: in principle should only with a single test.
Moreover, the workload of the students and " a realistic and reasonable level ".

The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries regulations should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Minister and Uni rector the saying of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so - called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part: " Each module, with only one test, " it says in a 30 - page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part.
With the " significant reduction in prüfungslast, " said the Accreditation Council Grimm, should be offered a " trend, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted. "
Moreover, the " Studierbarkeit " in the future, " the critical factor " in the design.
Modules as content are " strictly to examine " whether " unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of
Events " would be avoided.
The students ' right to maintain margins, the initiative will enable and promote ".
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies.
This must all five years ' reakkreditiert " - which means that it will take until 2015, all courses were reviewed.

The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October " with vigour " to the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too strict.

So far As the only country in Rhineland - Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
The money to the universities, especially Tutorenprogramme set up and studies advice and review and Auslandsämter.

This is the conclusion of a study model only one test.
The study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of performance to other universities and facilitate access to the master.

The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of Juso - university groups called for the design of education policy should not be held behind closed doors, " the ministers and university chancellors.
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students affected " a say. "
Support the future graduates from the President of the university rectors ' Conference (HRK) , Margaret winter coat: " We need the experience of the students, " she said on Thursday in a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal right, each graduates with a Bachelor - close access to a secondary Masters course.
On the other hand, that the current generation of Bachelor tomorrow sufficient master with the best possible conditions available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar.
The countries have to hire more teachers.
A freer access to the master of the Culture Minister, however.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany and is fine almost no control ... " is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which has lost this troubling language the arrival experience of dissidents who won the freedom, but at the same time his language area.
The 1951 in the Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993, the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the forum in Frankfurt.
For major literary sensation, he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitateakten. "
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner had received the German language in 1989.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner, " meaning someone who has campaigned against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough. "
The lyricist Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors by a case from Romania, the throes and the cowardice of a political system makes is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as one can tell after bisherigem knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate file IM Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it in for him at the time sensitive points ", " Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and in this audience, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the secret service, however.
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people concerned, so we must assume, speculation and in some case Sorin, Voicu and even Walter may also have known what klarname behind the aliases.
Unlike in the procedure safe sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring is still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) was first established in 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate head of Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, finally did it only once.
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly the case Söllner, as is so often the case in connection with verschwiegener inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The measured response of the Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, as the new coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a C - class.
The man with the distinctive Glatze left him because of the tourist city.
Otherwise, he would be able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and was the 55 - year - old as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but the work is continuing.
Or just right.
In the words of the first three days earlier Swiss: " We have reached the eighth final ", namely in the Champions League thanks to the success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, " but we must not be blinded by the success: it is a brutally tough fight against the descent. "
The " much more important task " on Sunday.

The joy at the start of the Babbel - successor behaviour.
Not only the supposed saviors, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time, self - confidence, dedication and game.
I am with the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and encouraged them to be brave souls plumber Gross said that as simple - sounding recipe for success, had ceased to have any effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel - Jens Lehmann, " if a new impetus in football, sometimes things happen would not have thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of violation break thanks to his dynamism to the best players on the field, the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " fresh air " and the operation of the new superiors: " He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it obvious.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sports Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, stability.
As Gross, players and managers, the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: the evil awakening, Khedira.
And sports bureau Horst Heldt reminded that a season objective has been achieved, but is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a broadcast television interviews just before the start of gate - keepers Jens Lehmann fresh.
There are decisions that the other and not the Jens, Heldt, countered the harsh criticism.
The leadership had accused the board of weakness and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after play had been withdrawn, Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were " characterised by pure selfishness, " keilte Heldt back and consequences for the final men.
They will not be friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team and strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had " a big share of the success, " said Heldt and Lehmann voices - and also the man with the plastic bag.

Of The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, the duel before the end of the Klitschko - era, but the blows of the world, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights into the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only on the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, met his blows the world champion but only rarely.
After all, he is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left for clarification of the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - according to the latest findings on the air strike in Kunduz, the opposition Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel trucks in September " knowingly the falsehood, " said Green group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD television news programme ".
It is called the landläufig: he lied.
The order to kill was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) .
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only about the destruction of the abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the German Kunduz - commander Colonel Klein requested NATO air strikes report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not influence specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg correctly and fully informed about the background of the tank vice - attack.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and the minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence even pointed to several reports, including a two - way document of the and a Feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sunday newspaper. "
He has not yet received a response, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the allegations and pointed out that in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden.
Anyone who witnessed in a guard traumartige conditions, things others do not see or hear in the modern Western world as crazy or, at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality.
Dream suddenly changed Wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the vision of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New - Age - prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychoses.
The gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted a " great similarity of the mistaken one with a dream, the dream of Sigmund Freud was " a climate, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, of such a ".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. turned into a character.
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him devil shape with blood red, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They chase him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and sets the noose around the neck.
Jumping.
The noose resolves itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, " walk in the clinic and let you cure! "
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi - low, he takes medication against depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he is married.
In the fears I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population at least once in life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is treated as the second most common illness after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychoses affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state of übererregten to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia.
The vote is particularly prevalent hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not important to separate more trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has a significance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as in a dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and not active.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality is not possible, the images are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a Halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says fox, " but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically. "
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why is our brain antics, researchers is still a mystery.
Exceptional conditions can lead in every person that he loses the reality in the short term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that involved minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain will be disrupted at an early stage of development, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox said.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the manifestiere not also first over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the choice is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, because they intervene in the transmitter system.
If our brain is overheating
The crazy, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and expensive drugs, in order to get rid of them, others are, in order to get money for drugs, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich caste.
Whether related images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of the position.
Caste collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and last year, he has his results in the book " The unreal world in our head. "
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of surprising many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise when, in which are sensory processing, discouraged or too little; if our brain or even if stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, pain or other mental conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in a lifetime to have experienced hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, really.
If it were not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he says, look at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it.
She is awake, they hear and see these boys, just as the girls in the bank in addition to hear and see.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy? , asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other images are not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the most frightening phenomena
The images are Often also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new classmates, while he explained for all other hearing and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures you see, the Fratzen or the girl with the arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
In the past year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes, she knows that she is not crazy.
Cow is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffered sensory deprivation, in all probability, hallucinations, after a while.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl, fear of other children, often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they dad, since they can think, is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish images and reality. " every experience, " says caste, " will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also night dream images of caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to Schizophrenen are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience is, unfortunately, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has creative - is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt - Degenhard has researched the so - called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi - dreams, the Erlebende for real and he cannot distinguish downstream from the.
The oneiroide awareness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self - and world loss is threatened by continuing replaces the life - threatening reality through their own imaginary world, the decoupled from reality, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a world of change is taking place, but the real situation in the imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and making itself in an intolerable situation, the people own ability, not submerged in a loss of loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The devoted art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book " change of heart " as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valve operation, followed by a heart transplant on travel, while his body to the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen, a in a selbstgeschaffene created world, other times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, among the drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel and even after years in minor details.
More and more even than real memories.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, says the psychiatrist hard.
Ultimately, show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the guards
Any change of status, say the psychologist caste, " can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality. "
An experience which can also be rewarding.
The snow fall can
Burda
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he told the mirror.
The holding is to include in future to 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the will to enter into the company, said the 69 - year - old the mirror.
The details we have as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are in a position to do so.
We cannot swallow 7 500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from January by the Presidency, and Paul Kallen to his successor.
The 52 - year - old Kallen is a board member since 1999 in Burda.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury the responsibility for the company's assets, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also for direct marketing, outside pressure and finances.
For the first time, is not a family member at the top of the Verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen is also " 10 to bridge 15 years, " Burda.
The holding should continue to 100 percent of the family Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said that family businesses are not safe from the sinking: " This was always families who were infected by a capital, which is completely and thought they could rise as a major player.
My strategy was never.
He had " never world dreams, " Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was, and I do not want to play the game in the world league with ' Time ', these shops have become too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only be read his e - mails, without a chance to see certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time on one of the products of the year.
To see It is on the road, is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek cost very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that it has two new devices on the market: one, that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, which it must pay a six times higher.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has come as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to give all the data in order to be able to read his e - mails, or if you cross the border, a café with WIFI (or are desperately seeking a link with Fon) .
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his e - mails and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) offer, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely rethink and start to consider ways of how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloading of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day of FonPeek a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States.
And that is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e - mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re - elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a bright yellow - green, the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and it was something groβförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that at the first sight, it seems that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and one from in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as a hair wreath, with the previous bore the hair.
75% of working mothers have given their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women's study " fertility and women in Spain. "
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study makes clear that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of you who work outside the home, no other activity, only part - time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
" The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and the first child and have achieved until much later.
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the contraceptive preparedness, " explains the CSIC, Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of the women in the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only the main education or higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or for the first time.
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss even before its first permanent employment and their first child, making it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and have their first child, Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth

The award of the British fashion industry

On this occasion, they were all appeared.

The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presented in " poker the Asse " (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the X - ray images of writers in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life) .
He used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes genre (short biography, life and work) , but is looking for a Änhlichkeit the fervent heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent neither horrors still Erleuchtungen.
Except that this book is a köstlicher lesegenuss, it is also a stirring call to read and read again and again.
Here are a few sequences from the book.
On Albert Camus: " reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt, without words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God. "
On Samuel Beckett: " nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what is in the blood, not in his brain, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a humour, without any sense of how the knife, which had nearly killed him. "
Graham Greene: " Our man was from this woman with a passion that lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the route of corruption. "
In addition to James Joyce's " Ulysses " was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, you must climb on the north wall, on the wall, try the best mountaineers. "
William Faulkner: " was a comical Kauz.
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a gutsbesitzers county and other times, he said that he was the son of a black and a Krokodils.
Both dreams of a certain GröΒe. "
On Louis - Ferdinand Céline: this writer took the insane cry from a bridge from the personality from Munich, so that his response until deep into the night of the 20th century to his literary way he made in a journey that he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the würmern.

Cowardly aggression
My 70 - year - old mother was last week by our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years herliefen, our dog is a Mischling we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard.
Our outrage is not in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and animal, which is, of course, on the leash.
In addition to the attack, a woman who was walking, she wanted to see these people as a result of the incident, feared for their own lives, because if wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, with a woman, a child and an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
We have, Of course, in a police department complaint, however, we have great doubts about whether it will bring that to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative will draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, the " far more than just the design and production of products with every day safer " and reiterated that they also help with other actions educational and informative nature to this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan ' to be or not to be ' in a first phase posters to distribute 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread.

The sale of small trucks is rising again something
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the manufacturers ' association Anfac and the car dealers ' association Ganvam presented figures.
These are good numbers, however, currently only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, which was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the overall admissions of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles sold in this number, but all vehicles from which the vans market is: descendants of passenger cars, pick - ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium - sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third - party financing.
So we have to these restrictions, which are the result of the tap of credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little.
This plan is intended not only to individuals, the self - employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, not exceed 160 grams per to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The car dealers association predicts for the 2010 a similar year just as the last, for which it with a sales (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is happening now with the ESP stability control systems, the aid in European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems, because of their operation can also help to prevent many front - rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers system on the basis of the Bremsstärke carried out on the recognises.
However, this system is not that pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss was no longer on the Bremspedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe with maximum force in the braking system and the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1.100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
It would be even less accidents - it is estimated that one in four accident involving personal injury could be prevented, once the so - called intelligent popularity.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, there has been a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helps him the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, namely that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be put off until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen that it will take in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturers, so this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper - sports cars, which the Russian group Converg stronger.
If it should come with any of these buyers to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close at the end of the year, if it is not sold by then, will continue to maintain.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilogram.
In order to create something, they believe, was the first to the automatic aufklappbare roof has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem so that alone has saved 21 kilograms; thanks to this model, the GT3 " disappearance " another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; from 64 to 54 reduced the fuel tank were saved another 7 kilograms; through the installation of sporting Bacquet - 12 and with the light 19 inches again saved five.
Then we had also achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR - 30 again six kilos less and the exchange of Türgriffe Griffe from substance by the lack of kilo.
Although he, too, with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test was carried out with a car with 6 - hand wheels, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig.
During his driving behaviour can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the streets.
Rather, the opposite is the case for long, we have a small and easy model, which is a but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, his muscles in a low gear in the required time to make warm until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then again, everything from his engine to get out ...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise it with the ' sport ' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which already has been used for the first time.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is unbelievably brutal, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraβen on which we are with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps.
The electronic assistants had to do on the whole route almost nothing; and, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, it can be said that there is an ultra - light car, a car with an indescribable Fahrspass has, as it would otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and 70.831 euros.

The office of the President must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January, when officially expires
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that he knows that " Mel " before that date the message, in which he had found since 21 September asylum must have left.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measure, it was used to stabilize the markets, the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly, the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the banks.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the para - normal amounts which the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard& Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, not to a degree of uncertainty for the defenders of the moral hazard had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness of what they had caused, since the devastating effects, which led to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously predicted.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the non - payments and therefore a euro member country no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the duty to maintain the stability of state money.
Yes, we are as expected from an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large sums, it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, the European differences and increase the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard& Poor's is a farce. during the early indicators of a large part of the market research institutes to their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which, with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, despite all the warnings of a long life.
Once again, it appears that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, " caution when driving ".
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural - Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed Galán the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, under the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the issue will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 MW more, under the will of course by other " Stützenergien. "
Galán, is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say this law, as incentives for the national coal consumption, which is the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, " in the long term in this direction, despite some " individual " Maβnahmen, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, that the decisions on the investment, even if they are, in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.
