A strategy Republican hinder the re-election of Obama
Leaders Republicans justified its policy by the need to fight ballot-rigging.
Now, the latter Brennan believes Centre a myth and says the vote-rigging is less frequent United States the number die of fall lightning.
Of fact, lawyers Republicans have not found more 300 cases of electoral fraud United States ten years.
A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
Here, these measures will undercut partly democratic system American.
Unlike Canada, States Americans are responsible for the organisation federal election United States.
And a majority of governments Americans enacted, from 2009, new laws still hampering registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has spread after the elections November 2010, the increasing 675 new representatives Republicans on 26 States.
Consequently, during 2011 introduced 180 projects bill restricted the right of vote on 41 States.
The new election laws require voters present a identity document with a photograph, also proof non-citizens.
Furthermore, these laws cut periods early-voting, maim the right to register as constituent the of the scrutiny and withdrawn their right to vote citizens with criminal records.
Before the elections 2006, no state American required voters submited a document of identity with photograph.
The rule Indiana first it.
The US Supreme Court confirmed at 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
On recent years these authorities have supported projects in 34 States to force voters to present a identity document with photograph.
Is important take account of, the contrast to Quebec US citizens not have a document, as the card universal identity Social Security.
Indeed, 11% of citizens Americans 21 million of voting age, have no identity document with photograph issued by a government agency of their state.
Furthermore, five million new constituents 2012 lacking identity document with these characteristics.
, but often, required identity costs document more 100 dollars.
With which, the new restrictions affect disproportionately the young, the minorities and persons low-income.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of persons earn less than 35 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of between 18 and 29 not have identity with photograph.
And even more.
On many states students, voters more vote candidates democrats, cannot use the document of identity with photograph your institution.
Furthermore, these States authorise members of clubs or hunting tend to vote party Republicans to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004 no state demanded proof citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state in present this requirement.
From 2011, a dozen States has adopted laws which require voters are showing American people.
These measures seek, clearly, limit the vote Spanish matter.
Seems two every three constituents Hispanics support the party Democrat.
Furthermore, legislators Republicans supported 2011 certain laws abolishing entered constituents the same day of scrutiny eight States.
Furthermore, cramping the right of people and groups create a service of assistance voters to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, general elections 2004, campaigns of registering voters contributed the registration of around ten million citizens.
Measures adopted since 2009 achieved rate of registering new voters into 2010 compared with 2006.
Furthermore, legislators Republicans adopted laws others five States favouring period for the vote by advance.
For example elections 2008 Florida, 33% voted for advance voters were African-Americans, while recent accounted for but 13% of state voters.
For Hispanics occurred exactly.
Is 11% of voters, a 24% of citizens vote for advance.
However, whites, which represent 76% of electorate, not represent 46% of citizens vote for advance.
Of course, legislators Democrats and their supporters objected fervently to adopting laws which restrict the voters.
Here, governors Democrats have blocked several projects bill.
The prosecution US intervened to suspend laws more controversial.
Was,, to limit damage.
For example, only 16 34 States adopted the law demanded the presentation a document identity with photograph.
However, is undeniably the new rules adopted complicate the right vote on 2012.
Critics Democrats denouncing the party laws voted, since it is clear with be influence the results 2012 the key states.
A report of the Centre Brennan 2011 shows States which have adopted such laws represent 171 of the necessary 270 votes polling achieve Presidency.
Is too early to say with certainty if these legislative changes city-wide electoral system significant will impact the presidential election results 2012.
A thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
Here, measures will undermine partly democratic system American.
Cancer detection prostate: could Hacerse the test or not?
Indeed, the test of PSA is occasions, results incorrect, with false results false results negative or even positive, following decided interventions medical useless.
Is a reason enough to wavering men, already reluctant, on if should be or not tests of detection.
Do Hacerse the test or not?
Have asked board two specialists.
In studies US detected a great index of infection between the groups sample it is hard interpret these data and make recommendations firm.
The European study showed mortality certain difference among patients had made detection and the not.
The study monitoring 12 years, proved moreover between the 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if not achieved tests detection.
I therefore recommend the test from 50, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of origin African-American have a higher risk.
The key is take a good decision once detected cancer.
Is cancers aggressive and others cancers which are lax.
Is really need that the patient understand the degree of risk its cancer. Must provide all options and not necessarily dealing cancers prostate not violate the lives long-term which case must opt rather active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men which has detected a cancer are not Treaties, as said cancer is not aggressive or entails a risk their lives.
Instead, I suggest active surveillance of the disease and if this progressing, offer them treatment.
Determine increasingly often criteria precise to decide who should or not be Treaty.
Recommend the test anyway.
But is important speaking with medical to determine if must be the test or not.
Movember has created, cooperation with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows assess the pros and cons of test of PSA.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is a recipe miraculous to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of investigations, adopting habits healthy remains best reduce risks suffer the disease.
We if everyone eat well and move enough, could prevent 30% cancers.
'If nobody smoke, this rate up at least 50%' stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman company Canadian Cancer.
Instead evaluated around 10% of cancers are inherited.
Many other remains totally inexplicable.
Society Canadian Cancer, combating smoking remains a priority despite the fall deters.
Tobacco is growth-linked 85% of cases lung cancer.
Is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
Greatly harms health of people.
'Today still is 1.5 million smokers in Quebec ", declared spokesman André Beaulieu.
A fact hopeful: ten years after stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity favor also the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase risks breast, bowel and rectum of well, pancreas and uterus.
'research shows the regular practice of physical activity throughout the lives protects against breast cancer', added.
Food
The body recommends, equally, limit consumption red meat.
Large quantities climbing, the risks of a colorectal cancer.
Prepared meat products also must avoided.
Conservation meat for its smoked, delicious Dutch herrings can result drying or training carcinogens.
'can damaging cells the body and lead to development of cancer', we explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between the complex vitamin and cancer.
However, for the moment investigations are not conclusive.
Segú the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them was a lower cancer risks prostate, another what they observed was, rather, a increase.
The effect of vitamin D cancer unable to determine clearly.
Furthermore, M. Beaulieu insists the importance of discuss the concerns and family background of each with its doctor.
'Making the test of detection not cause cancer.'
The bosón details Higgs
The announcement of likely discovery of bosón Higgs generated consternation last summer, and with right.
, the bosón is involved mechanism responsible for the mass all on the universe, nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or 'less bad' explanation of nature and the behaviour, has not yet been noticed empirically.
But to physicists not clearly be Higgs.
Know undoubtedly a new particle and resembles the bosón Higgs predicted by the model standard.
Furthermore, new data revealed this week a important congress physics concluded Kyoto appear confirm is, although still more data to be safe.
All ways presumably is Higgs, already that the possibilities mistake seem to few. See what.
There is great world, a law and inevitable widespread involved that two things not the same place the same time.
No way of infringing and not this rule try too, because will getting damage.
Although physics particulates is a world very complex, proved in it there a law of these characteristics: the principle exclusion Pauli, stipulating two particles cannot occupy the same space simultaneously if are same “state quantum '; a'" state consisting, broadly some of characteristics.
Physicists fall particles two categories.
By a part faced with good citizens so-called fermiones supporting wisely the principle of Pauli.
And are the bosones, a dirty bunch of anarchists not has respect for nothing, or not by this principle, which means on the same place and the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Laboratories Berkeley which is extraordinary, the bosones fall into two: the groups landlords, not discuss here, and the 'particles force', for which the large forces of nature spreading and with which the bosón Higgs would some form relative.
These bosones, might emphasize are not the gruesome creatures exotic we could believe.
Indeed, if achieved read this chronicle, is thanks to a bosón extremely banal: the fotón or 'particle light' acts as' messenger 'of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with a burden electric accelerates or changes direction, 'repeatedly' the field electromagnetic at the environment; a little as when launched a stone to a pond.
This' mess' begets a wavelength electromagnetic (of light the infrared, the ultraviolet, etc) and this wavelength is not a fotón; namely one of the bosones' bearers. "
Field stable more
The same Higgs bosón, is other field, the field Higgs, which needs be 'disorderly' to this appear bosón.
Now, the field Higgs is much more stable the field electromagnetic. For be needed to energies activate extremely high, a little as a icy pond which only a higher rock could glide by the surface.
Therefore lacking immense accelerator of particles as the CERN (the great Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to achieve such standards energy.
The analogy with the field electromagnetic is a new tool explains the relationship between the Higgs and the masse.
Not all particles or all materials interact with the field electromagnetic.
Some, as magnets, do, but other not: a piece of part, for example sustained never alone clung to the door of a refrigerator.
And the same way, not all particles interact with the field Higgs: the do have a masse, while the rest (how the fotón, incidentally), not the have.
Now, what 'can make' all such research?, question Madam Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and, furthermore, physicists escrutinen differences between the comments and the predictions of MS.
For its part, many want fervently, because the lower difference could open a door to a 'new physical' tape model certain holes.
This, has still major gaps as not explanation proposes on the seriousness (UPS!) or dark matter, which is around 80% of the the Universe (another UPS!).
But not have found such differences on CERN until now.
Repercussions
Impact of such investigations our day-to-day are difficult of predict, but not believe mistake to say which will have no.
To see: the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers laboratories not suspected the result revolution its work.
Entreveían applications scientific, but nothing more.
Indeed, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked laboratories Bell, where invented lasers on 1960, and by the first continued lasers (the first were pulsados) 1962, the principle lasers was rather considered a 'laboratory apparatus'.
Imagine...
And applications also can also proceed throughout the orchestration surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador light on 1969 during their research optical.
Despite was no its original intention, this captador serves now 'eye' to all digital appliances the world, which Award Nobel physical 2009.
This not mean, of course, activities of LHC want necessarily transform our lives, but never knows...
Palliative care. Best die... | Le Devoir
Your Commission die dignity, Quebec discussed recently the sensitive issue of order of life.
The debate must continue soon while prepares a bill.
Now, within this dominance essential, still much do.
I Devoir has tried see it closely.
Only a weeks, Mr L. lived only on its apartment of the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer which was destroying had given a respite two years.
'I had given five years, but already been so seven', tracing, a is, lying on bed on the heart palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, the previous day.
'But is always a shock, cannot be ready for this', continues.
It has raged: a weakness huge prevented go only to bathing and even eat alone.
Sitting against a tempting lunch, accepts resigned to help eat.
Courageous, even smile, to speak with the little-known-about I involved care, I bring medicines and offer bathing. A
The courage ordinary death.
'My greater desire is I heal diarrhea, is humiliating', admits.
Hours later, the team found remedy this evil.
'During our lives learn a makes PiS of', substance Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the heart Victor-Gadbois.
Return to childhood, to certain people, is a unacceptable humiliation.
'That depends the person to accept this regression',.
Because, according to the opinion of the majority of people work care palliatives, the great moment in the heart of this regression.
All patients entering the heart palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer cancer.
Have of prognosis maximum life three months.
On this state team doctors and nurses around them already care not offer curative ''.
The greater fear Mrs A., 89 years, is die 'aware and drowned'.
But the disease asked discover their children.
'I good children', adds.
'Ya I are more wishes this, says, before accept it fire-bombing mascarilla to help breathe.
And hopes, the days, a last visit of son lives in Italy.
On Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group volunteers, care the body and assistance food.
Are palliative care they when nothing more.
To help their death more comfortable.
On Quebec have a bed palliative care for each 11.700 inhabitants.
Is very little as know all result dying some day.
Here, the lives continues the better conditions possible, explained Dr Christiane Martel, a of the doctors of centre.
Whether to level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
The moribund it offer shenanigans potable brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
To diabetics not already controls its rate of sugar.
Death part of everyday.
Yesterday evening I serve beer Mr X, died during the evening.
This tomorrow, his son over beer the late feet.
'Ayudamos both patients and their loved', substance Nathalie Savard, director care.
The focus Victor-Gadbois the days proceed without be never equals.
Beside a man of 94 years savoring its last meeting family the courtyard, well placed between their almohadas while all drink to their health, a young 36 years dies tragically, surrounded for their parents, woman and its two children, having tried everything to survive.
'For six months, always is three five beds occupied by people under 45 ill cancer', worries Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted at the heart Victor-Gadboisarrivent is of home and 47% of hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% Canadians simply cannot access palliative care, is say, to treatment designed to alleviate suffering when a ill reaches the stage terminal their lives, is at home in the hospital or a centre of care.
And several bodies, as the heart Victor-Gadbois and society palliative care door-to-door of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively care of cancer patients.
Is precisely this major omission in healthcare Quebec what many doctors specialist palliative care fear adopting a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
From the October, a manifesto signed by Eminences of palliative care, as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate its opposition to such initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the health system Quebec is not sufficiently competent as to ensure anyone has right to palliative care quality earlier accepted proceed with euthanasia.
'Recently', tracing 'seen a patient proceed 14 days knee-capping experiencing major pains without having done the necessary to relieve this.
Fear patients wish die only because not receive good care '.
And parallel, many oncologists insist with their patients until last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when left chemotherapy treatment tiring.
'When I said to my oncóloga to the treatment, it I said gave great pity that I must fight', tracing.
'However, it I said that nothing more to!'
No care all-powerful
Dr Martel believes 90% of the sick requesting die thank their carers not they handled their demands once they soothed their pain thanks to a team palliative care.
But there palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful the treatment pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care door-to-door of Grand Montréal, patients not answer treatments on pain 8% of cases.
The end of life, doctors often resort to sedating palliative to sleep until the patient the time their passing, whether sporadically or permanently.
Cannot pretend not understand this part suffering.
Increasingly, disease not relieved will have have this sedating palliative.
Patients are not relieved say all same: 'I I die'.
But this not mean necessarily 'I euthanasia', but 'I I alleviate'.

Real-estate scandals far-reaching in Quebec
Road network, officials businessmen BTP, fundraisers party mafia and experts Italian have, day after day, what know a 'system formidable' of industry construction, officials politicians, unionists and mafia.
A 'industry' went too taxpayers dear Quebec, especially 1990 and 2000.
'It is strange how the system pulveriza once have dead to the major means', ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, Member Quebec and former leader Montreal Police.
He led scandal the outbreak of 2011, which was possible thanks to a investigation on malpractice linked contracts roads in Quebec the first Liberal Minister this moment Jean Charest, had not consented rather than delaying.
The 'report Duchesneau' established a direct link between the industry illegal, funding parties and corruption between officials.
'Since the start research 2010, only transport ministry would saved billion contracts', containing some of its instincts of stay with part proportional.
The Commission Charbonneau 'has already made two mayors', adds, waiting power to 'demonstrate the existing ploys behind individuals'.
A permanent unity anti-corruption created 2011
Permanent Unity anti-corruption created 2011, also applies with his team of inspectors researchers and government analysts.
This unity work moreover of policemen 'the escuadra Marteau' which, since 2009, have the 'cartel the sewers' exercises Montreal to inflate contracts.
Recent weeks, unity proceeded the registration series accusations by fraud and corruption against officials municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor a city outskirts.
Next of the list be Gilles Vaillancourt, just to resign Mayor of Laval, third city Quebec.
Is suspected has nicked by repeated bribes to change contracts.
Has formally charged engineers the roads Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This last has caused shock the explain to the committee mechanics' system 'of obtaining procurement.
He paid for three years 3% of value contracts achieved in Montreal a intermediary linked the mafia which transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to all-out during the 2000, giving more 88 000 dollars Canadians (a 68,000) party provincial, mainly Liberals.
Admitted, equally, having organized a fundraising illegal ex-viceprimera Minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation the cost contracts sewage
On Montreal, the 'system corruption' work effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero, explained public-works perfectly Commission: ten years received gifts, invitations Travel golf tournaments, restaurants, party hockey and bribes enterprises building sector totaling 736.000 dollars, all to change sewage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other have road network officials admitted given money for inflating the bills between 30% and 40% of false extras.
Furthermore, an organizer's Party mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay having made the eyes deliberately a budget parallel and filled their coffers dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was a of the first policies Montreal elected made sound the alarm.
As mayor district of Rivière-des-Prairies, this of the island, opposed since 2010 to the sale of municipal ground acquired by $5 million and resold by 1.6 million promoters full housing boom.
70% of money of campaigns was dirty money
Research finally conducted, it guarantees that throwing 'a thread to understand the system, root ants, by to stop gangrene and fish the culprits'.
And adds the process is' painful, but positive '.
Are cleaning the wounds but would take a clean research unit on Montreal and be very vigilant to dubious practices not repetition.
How to cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part declares' officials have stolen hundreds million dollars', but is restless above all by the role of the 'elected politicians the ploy'.
Believes 70% proportion of money dirty went to funding of electioneering on Quebec ironiza: 'I have said this is not a pale reflection reality'.
The government quebequés proposes limit 100 dollars donations to parties, but this not change donation, he, 'while not adhere strictly electoral expenditure, money dirty the policy.
Recommends complete review of system prize-awarding of procurement and party financing: 'cannot fall lowest; go the substance things, courage, enable us rebuild home with bases stronger, with more controls and laws'.
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those laugh look the mirror.
'the GSP is not the FC Barcelona!'
This season acquired a new entity with the GSP.
How explain this progress?
Could explain by a individual conscience, but also by the new dimension GSP.
Have come major players.
Go day to its hand.
The technical staff I also has brought much.
And these elements prompts me daily to raising my stake.
A party, this is easier.
All is very rapidly in football.
But I not I acaloro.
From my early in central preformación of INF Clairefontaine to my step Saint-Etienne, always I advanced leaps.
Will profit competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are accustomed to play parties very high level.
Know each training is crucial.
This makes a player as I keen to fight and disseminate all.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much on my positioning.
Is supported by attached as Claude Makelele, which played in the same position I.
Is Ancelotti is the man needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one equal in the League 1 and is between the best trainers European.
Has a great experience and won many titles the better clubs.
Has worked great players.
Believe to be other degrees Paris.
On January had a conversation very comforting with him.
I had out of a number injuries.
Faith me also explains my good performance.
What does on the GSP the first part season?
On the League 1, Lyon we took the leader.
But we the ambush.
One of our major objectives is the League of champions: we classified for the eighth end with style.
What is the objective of club this competition?
We reach out the further possible.
From now, anything.
But have great deal with many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, end the first of our League the Oporto to receive round eighth of end.
The GSP can become a great European club short term?
Already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be there long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Economic, the GSP is delivered their means to this project actualization.
Not win the glass on the League 1, like last season, constitute a major failure?
Of course, be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in lead this title of champions.
The last season not we far.
On May we take a disappointment, as had optimum conditions for finish first.
Had a season strong.
We with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a season quite better.
This year believe the good.
Even if the major equipment as the Marseilles, the Lyon and the Bordeaux fight for the title, think we have arms to llevárnoslo.
Does the media expect more of GSP?
Is normal to wait much of us considering what was spent on players that have.
We accepted entirely.
After we win 4-0 at home to Troyes, which still with things criticise is a little frustrating.
We wonder what more expected the people.
Can never win 4-0 all weekends.
Not are the FC Barcelona!
We a project off-side.
A team is built with time.
The League of champions have shown we can respond and be present.
Talk Manchester City, after two seasons, has not achieved qualify for eighth of end, and they also invested greatly!
Given the sums invested, imaginaríamos with 15 points of advantage to the day.
This would neglect our adversaries and the championship France.
Lyon and Marseilles, not were well the season previous, have been 'driven' by this new GSP.
This shows the League 1 is exciting.
I can say with May smiles, despite all the difficulties end taking the trophy.
The GSP seems perfectly resource-dependent success Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better than say we a 'Zlatandependencia'.
This means Ibrahimovic is very competent and burying many goals.
Has been to demonstrate the star the League 1.
And has shown in all the teams for past is a great player, a world star.
The group respected man and the gambler.
And he also respects men has around.
It genuinely exceptional.
This pushes the other to increasing its level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of world, also allows all progress.
How you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Has been a disappointment.
Was very enthusiastic by participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury I prevented accumulate time.
Saw things there and left strengthened.
Today achievement play selection good parties.
Is what expected from my baptism with the 'Bleus'.
Learned the lesson of what spent Ukraine and this must be today have exemplary.
What vision you have the first month of Didier Deschamps by the 'Bleus'?
Is obtaining results.
Are well-placed group World classification for the.
The seleccionador is, close to players rigorous and inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But not I comparisons.
Achieved Blanc its objective classify you to Euro.
Hopefully Didier Deschamps carried selection Brazil.
The standoff (1-1) of 16 October Spain served to the foundations?
Play gave us confidence.
Each struggled by all.
Before this shock Spain, not had experienced a play similar throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Opposite of currency exchanges current, based on central banks, transactions identified and the burden processing between the parties.
Furthermore, as often the technologies, the vision policy is palpable: the belief that the system monetary current, composed of monopolies banking, is financial crises.
Indeed, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a () is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euro etc and a protocol of change secure way of BitTorrent, enabling exchange of files equals.
Have occurred near 200,000 transactions thanks 15 computers of the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept the bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The value of the bitcoin, having reached atop 30 dollars (EUR 23) June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before today to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).
Is nothing impressive compared with changes global real currency or financial products.
However, the ECB) concerned him a report on coins published October virtual.
It described the bitcoin as' the currency virtual ',' more success competing dollar or the euro similar 'and' currencies conventional '.
Bitcoin differs of others systems with virtual coins as the 'appropriations', used to advance vídeojuego a and can win playing or can buy (and even sometimes swap).
The social networks Facebook developed also such system.
But around exchange a central authority changes controls and is.
With the bitcoin, all nodes network are time depositaries of books, verifiers, currency emitters and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is done between two addresses as e-mail.
A user can choose a different direction to each payment, guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this compromise signing electronically through a system cypher to double key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the compromise.
Thanks to content of the database, is also possible ensure changes bitcoins of appear Book of accounts public, disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is write this new compromise in this book.
This is through resolution a challenge mathematician launched to computers and the winner, a kind of central banker provisional will the privilege of add this line complementary.
Is a stage file meat of, transformation a great file a numerical footprint shortest and only.
Computers' take 'new compromise and add a number before' trocear '.
The aim is find the number provide an footprint particular (more zeros the principle).
Once is this number, the others nodes verify easily which is good.
The is then compromise indestructiblemente linked chain joint the other change transactions; changes footprint.
If, to commit scam, user like pay twice with the same money very rapid (less than ten minutes), the network just accept valid as a of the two transactions; the other would an orphan, as both have fingerprints different.
The computer to resolve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is in two regularly, with probability before the end 2012.
The number of bitcoins on movement is therefore limited 21 million, but are divisible until cienmillonésimo, leaving a large margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is reveals also each calculation increasing power.
The lives network has already rollercoaster.
Websites provide services to Bitcoin have been attacked and have stolen bitcoins on deposit.
'The failure used not affects same protocol', ensures Pierre Noizat, just launch Paymium, a company payment real currency uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB takes account moreover possibilities blanquo of money thanks to this service anonymous.
But the cash present the same defect.
Players weight as Wikipedia reject payments this kind.
Other, as the platform Wordpress, accept.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Insitito Weizmann Israel, discussed the book accounting and showed close 80% of bitcoins not circulates.
November launched the 'discounts giants'.
'change $30,000', regocija Jon Holmquist, working for Coinabul, which makes the bitcoins gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a book pedagogical on this currency, believes fairly the potential of this technology while network of transactions.
Its system Paytunia, amounts to a card credit () or real currency mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, so leave cheaper.
The bearer, furthermore, administers their identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy launch shops, not must install new terminals or softwares.
Simply provide a direction a telephone can 'cautioned and recognise', accurate Pierre Noizat, ensuring have thousands users.
We general review of systems hierarchical by systems more horizontal.
'do lack a time for Bitcoin arise but 2013 could be a change', predicts.
Furthermore, report the ECB provides revalue risks diverse, today regarded senior, if this currency succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must emerge late 2014.
Is time the Afghan army continue possession of its territory and Afghans choose its future, without expect nothing of us.
Have punished mainly Afghan peasants, the we regarded terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more the injured and the maimed.
The Taliban have extremists foreigners and old leaders refugees Pakistan, but often with peasants rejecting the presence of foreign army, as times Soviet.
Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if to its causes join jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, the Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will not when already Westerners more discreet.
The French troops of the basis of Nijrab, I noticed from high the hills planted of almendros thanks appropriations French made order.
The of lorries convoys and tanks returned Kabul without suffering any attack, under helicopters.
No influx of Taliban Kabul from late 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its step irresistible between 1994 and 1996.
Vacuum Kabul was then and the country involved in fire and blood because of struggles between different factions.
Taking control of country was perceived as a kind liberation, the return safety.
Afghans have paid price of obscurantism of their peasants swamped by the organisation al-Qaeda, but their situation is not better today.

A Constitution after a struggle Egypt
Is a new or nothing double President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the statement constitutional, gives provisionally powers plenaries he play decided the all the.
Took everyone by surprise the Wednesday, when announced the Constituent Assembly vote its text end the following day.
Only a week, the Head of State gave two more months to this House to finish its work.
And almost two years Egypt uses a text provisional several times modified, what weakens institutional stability and judicial entanglements.
This new initiative failed the fractured the country.
For its opponents, President persisting its' delirium autocratic 'and continues' betraying its word 'and' trampling the right '.
By part supporters, ensures to be a finally faster with the institutional crisis and policy and accelerate the transition process.
The next 15 days should organise a referendum.
A very short period of time obliging the Brothers to renounce their project explain the text article by article, Egyptians.
For President is a way to regain legitimation popular and democratic while the controversy ravages around the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced Egyptians will vote for it, as a interview the American weekly Time.
Recital the resource voted rapidly, contains a ultimatum to the Egyptian people: 'or vote my text or full powers maintain the', powers supposedly will its order with the Constitution.
Is this environment strange where 85 Members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist its large majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals not went to the convening.
To mid-November, a little earlier statement constitutional, had closed the door because felt could not assert its views.
The human rights representatives religious minorities and civil society did the same.
To achieve the quorum, last tomorrow added to 11 people, members substitutes, hastily.
Some of them are very close to the Brothers Muslims.
Unsurprisingly, Articles voted have been unanimously.
Commentators makes them grace, furthermore, a of the few discrepancies times voiced virtually to prayer, is several committee members arrived think the clock badly Constituent the.
The text yesterday afternoon was still remains voted, 234 articles.
Article 2, the spotlight, remains Constitution finally identical to 1971, which stipulated 'the early Sharia are the main source the right'.
Parties Salafis, for those establishing Islamic law is a vindication fundamental, expected it could replace 'the principles' by 'the rules', what had allowed a implementation stricter.
To Islamists, this article was not amended is a guarantee its goodwill and its respect for the others components of Egyptian society.
The liberal denouncing of hypocrisy and consider it is only a advertising trick.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
Relate especially Article 220, which gives al-Azhar a consultative role University, particularly for anyone who has of confirm its laws of Sharia.
According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier is disturbing because 'people so-called to Rule unelected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here see the premises a theocracy '.
Fears Liberals are also increased by next rector of this university be rather less moderate the current.
'For now, no a involvement specific religious.
With this Constitution are under the civil status.
Most jurists who have working on this text university but are not ulamas, some of them taught system French ', explained Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition Egyptian.
But recognises can be some ambiguity on Article 220, because the terms imitate employees vocabulary religious.
'We refer specifically term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could future would what extent are judges competent civil to pronounce above all this'.
Beyond its church-based, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms relate to the powers widespread which confers the chairman of the Republic.
The Brothers Muslims will argue we are few compared with which were during the earlier regime.
Another sticking-point: the powers conferred on the army.
Under the wish the military, the budget review not be put to Parliament but to a national Council defence.
Nor banned prosecutions of civilians on courts military, as asked associations for human rights.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, of now on, insults are banned, could have serious consequences for free expression, particularly the press.
Furthermore, no Article emphasises protection of women, emphasises Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
To all positive was the ban of torture agree with Article 36.
The word was not on the previous Constitution.
Although Egyptian President should leave yesterday evening in television, provide demonstrations to midday.
Supporters the Head of State marched the Saturday.

'The large and powerful' you lead to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While Members and human rights defenders discussing the consequences bringing the law on the compulsory examination, have already appeared on the country tricksters trading with certificates false '
Each year, 13 million workers immigrants reach Moscow, San Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Mostly citizens of countries Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its sole aim is money to help their families stayed home.
Since 1 December enters force a law, whereby each immigrant have labour scrutiny to see their knowledge of Russian.
For now, this rule applies only for those intending of work in of services, services, domestic services and Community retail.
However, with time, as promise at the Immigration, examinations mandatory will for all immigrants.
Furthermore, not is pay examining language, if not also the of Russian history and the of legislation.
Knowledge the language must confirm even for receive and renew the work permit.
Are exception citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Will not be subject to this law persons managed obtain their education diplomas and diplomas before the dissolution of the Union Soviet 1991.
Usefulness, fate and rights
The network examiners work EU-sponsored the Institute Russian Language Pushkin, the University Friendship of the Peoples, State University Moscow, State University San Petersburg and other institutions of higher education Russian.
Immigrants to be to tests on all cities, now Russia are open 160 such.
The initiative on examination introduction was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Immigration.
But defenders of rights, long before the law into force, achieved frequently do this question to the press: what will this actually?
What changes bring requirement knowledge language, both for Russians as for the immigrants themselves?
Firstly, respond representatives Service Immigration, this will reduce the number of 'labour slavery'.
Many people talk today on the the labour immigrants, explained Victor Sebelev, leader representation Federal External Immigration of Russia Tajikistan.
Defence their rights must begin before departure.
Only a selection system organised will solve the problem immigrant workers 90% of cases.
The problems immigrants have without profession, education, the not know language nor spend control doctor.
Without understanding language, States Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people, with the pretext help, I tarred a '' to a viajecito paid shocking and close covacha, where he and dozens others consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 14 hours the day.
Received countless complaints of our immigrants.
'In their homeland promise them a thing, but at are cheated, deprived of their passports, not paid wages promised', confirms Head of the Directorate immigration labour immigration External Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
I enoje, jefecito!
However, meanwhile many citizens republics Central Asian want work in Russia recognise which not know language of the country to go, but in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not both its but their own misfortune: few Turkmen people, Uzbeks, Tajiks to afford primary education normal.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, for alone vestirlos, calzarlos and buy for them to school.
The reach adolescence, these boys venture to work to the first opportunity.
Is difficult, if not is known language, recognise them.
'One is and lower humiliated'.
However, regard to the law on the language, defenders of rights point a important point.
Examinations are carried out only for those whose status immigrants legal.
If not have this status, there will not examination and, consequently, no work official.
Meanwhile, most workers immigrants continue in Russia illegally.
'Welcome or forbidden the step strangers'
Many visitors State receive the status official our country is not as easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and on the difficulties language itself.
Furthermore, the legalisation costs money: 12 thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, enrollment false can be quickly and only a half rubles.
Employees Russian police know usually we false documents, are not registered and cases of extortion.
'We asking hundred or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea', remarked to journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
'we, not be paint tacaño, purchase a'
The first day of the entry into force of the language law, highlighted that not only documents registration of immigrants can be fake.
Several certified 'false' of language knowledge have already been seized by officials Federal External Immigration.
The falsified documents had been printed in printer standard of colour.
Of course, reached the hands of new proprietors not as gift: each immigrant, queriéndose facilitate the task spending evidence, paid document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and more expensive than procedure examination official, employees immigrant three thousand rubles.
The main task for a future next is protect the system against corruption to the 'diplomas' cannot be buy, converge government officials defenders and of rights.
The authorities can promise workers immigrants had not could happen with success examining the first again time to study the course basic language.
Furthermore, to immigrants speaking Russian be offered work requiring communication active people.

Are on strike restaurant employees fast-food and US supermarkets
To a quarter of US adolescents their first work teller 'McDonald'
On recent days, US initiated a wave of protests on low wages paid supermarkets the corporation Walmart and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains such as' McDonald ',' Burger King ',' Taco Bell ',' Wendy's' and 'Kentucky Fried Chicken'.
For now nobody dares assert if will or not this wave the nine points, or has spent lose forces and amansarse on their early stages.
Action protest have the support unions and a number of NGOs left-wing.
Also increase the modest salaries received by workers Walmart and the system fast-food, the objective of organisers protests is the creation unions workers in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy virtually has not been occupied by the unions.
Is Forty and six cents per year?
Action started week, after the day Thanksgiving, the 'Black Friday'. This day, US coomenzaba the orgy discounts which captured to million, sometimes has involved clashes.
This day, some workers Walmart the corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs pickets of and contained protest together with the unions and activists left-wing shops the corporation, whose products to people modest income moderate and.
Walmart sells all, from nappies, rifles hunting and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk.
Products at its stores are average between 8% and 27% cheaper the of the major supermarkets.
Is why many workers underpaid of Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and mix products have fact Walmart a corporations larger America.
According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products very low-priced, partly because paid little to their workers.
Recent also complain poor working conditions, such as the lack of there or scanners.
This' Friday Black the involved demonstration demanded increasing salaries and complained the cost health-insurance provided by the corporation spent 30 to 100 monthly.
For a typical worker of Walmart, receiving 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure is excessive, said.
Scientists University of California at Berkeley argue if Walmart increases the average until 12 $per hour, this will cost Corporation 3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more what spent wages now.
If Walmart places the increase wage the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will be only 46 cents more expensive.
A year them spend the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more what now.
Supporters of Walmart told satisfied the protest took place only nine States and it no loss to the corporation.
The 'Friday Black continued in their shops from the 8 Thursday afternoon until midnight following day, and during this time, Walmart sold around 5,000 articles by second.
, their tills made the 'Friday Black almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company Dan Fogelman, declared interviewed the website of left Huffington Post, left their jobs' less five 'employees Walmart and the protest had not been' another public relations trick ', organised by workers Union.
'Box free!'
Protests continued New York this week, the objectives were not precisely stores Walmart (this progressive town not them appreciation, and why now no), but the 'McDonald' and others restaurants cheap.
Let McDonald says which sells billions of portions, and then even you give sick and not you pay for your work honest!
Jumaane Williams, Council member Municipal New York
Currently, agree with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is of 7.25 $.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing with time, but only slightly, and average, ordinary workers receive New York 8,90 per hour.
Nobody earns less they.
How survive New York with this money, for me is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost quarter of adolescents US derided for the McDonald and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school yet lived with their parents.
Few were the saw this as the main income planned or stay there long time.
Now, constantly failure in interviews with workers McDonald who complain for of this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
Furthermore, a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal a comment whose points out it irresponsible bear children if not know with what to eat.
Players protests, which began to 6: 30 Thursday morning the McDonald of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded the tellers and cooks fast-food they start pay for least 15 $per hour, they double its minimum wage current.
Also demanded sector fast-food of the creating unions workers.
The law of the US prohibits the administration prevent this right and punish activists unions with skulduggery and redundancies.
Furthermore, rarely it administration life.
But, for objective reasons, is easy unions cover the sector food rápid.
A major staff is the excessive rotation.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place this same day others restaurants cheap Manhattan.
The culmination of action rally took place half McDonald the near Times Square, involving several politicians local democrats, particularly the Council member Municipal the city Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald says is selling billions of portions, and then even teaches you a hospital or you pays for your work honest'.
Demonstrators received the support of other highlighted Democrats New York, for example candidate to Mayor of the city Bill of Blasio, which said 'must support workers fast-food sector receive to achieved fair wages and economic prosperity deserves each neoyorkino'.
As described the newspaper New York Times, this was the greater demonstration such American history of the fast-food.
But few involved hundreds people even, not all were employees fast-food service, where trabakan tens of thousands New York.
Is not yet clear if this will spark to cause a mass movement.
'For now, deceive the brain is not easy'
The issue of reality improved so popular among fans to technologies modern, late perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
To early summer, annual conference Google showed a model movement and subsequently, November, it transpired Microsoft tabled also a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with chief interactive technology 3D the laboratory Cambridge Microsoft, Izadi Sharamom, was illuminating to scientists this company glasses already belonged to a stage.
To them attracts the perspective manipulation of objects virtual on air with the hands naked and the creation spaces open virtual.
- Please generally what is the studied its research group?
- We are the interaction persona-ordenador, but we extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity its mass has been stage trapped work pixels of the screen flat, sometimes the is the finger.
But we looking 5-10 years forward and guessing the changes in this interaction cardinal.
For example, the console Xbox and sensors represent a step Kinect and today no Xbox sells without Kinect, already interested all control by gestures.
- what more the future holds?
- Despite led Kinect interaction physical the level, much of this still happens on a screen flat, to times 3D.
The introduction information has improved (the system receives more), and exit still is not very good.
Are seeking to change systems this, work imaging really three-dimensional, based on different technologies, including the of design.
Must ridding the world computer the our, the physicist, more tangible.
To this, however, is necessary acknowledge the user, but also the area.
Then can complete the real world with objects virtual a more comfortable.
Firstly, the devil with these fools helmets of virtual reality!
- what you think about control by voice?
A detail very popular, but not believes it over-estimate?
- surely not can consider a panacea, remains resolving, already privacy not always wants others listening of our actions and intentions.
Indeed, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own area.
For example, to control devices into public places, had a project that consider gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter.
Furthermore, gestures were caught not by the Chamber of the device but by a wristwatches which had the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now, but theoretically can be reduced the size of a wristwatch.
But, overall, the future is for combined control, for example gesture + voice.
- how this is?
- Of example, how I ask you forward this tin of Soda?
You will and the shows the same time.
- Normally I only speaking.
- Oh, this will be hard recognise.
- or is, you to force users adapt to what can or cannot do the machine?
- not necessarily, but is mutual.
Believe a future next we have to work design mainly new types sensor to determine precisely the reactions.
These can be, for example sensors already lasers, which provide a good resolution in-depth, what is very important.
- If we his work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what complaints you cameras modern?
Do you lack resolution, thoroughly or more?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the start of our work with the recognition three-dimensional.
Of course, be good 8 megapíxeles to the speed 1000 fps.
But issue is not the megapíxeles but on quality of the matrix and depth.
From this last view, all existing technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work designers of algorithms.
Or is, we must remind not only the resolution on axes X and and, but also Z.
Is also important speed, the number scoreboards by second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond, sensor contact with retardation processing adjustable 1-100 Ms and mention that modern sensors produced serial are closer the second value 60-100 ().
Not everybody understands how much this affects the interaction hombre-máquina.
I be very useful for my work equivalent of such device but not require contact to datasheets by second more.
- and is not need to increase the number cameras?
The Kinect now has three 'cameras', a of which is the issuer of infrared and the second recipient the signal reflected.
But the third chamber is actually a simple sensor of standard visible.
This is not used to determine depth of subject.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or contrary, increase it and increase amount required calculations.
A, play analogous flexible Kinect with the curvature of location cameras and see how this would help determinr the position three-dimensional.
- Concerning I recall Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses the public.
Does view of daily use of technologies reality increased, glasses are a platforms more visible?
-, everything the time holding a smart phone the hands, is not oh-so-comfortable, but I: the better option would be a reality increased 'transmutable' when, basis of a platform of cloud, you could move of glasses the smart phone,
Glasses are devices very personal, this is its strength (things private only you can see them), but also its weakness: a reality increased based on glasses not will work on objects with others virtual.
- imagine if manipulation objects virtual holográficos air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film 'Iron Man', but also for any simple deadly.
There is a problem in this idea critics often point to: must táctil response!
The not feel nothing!
What answer prepares its Group for this challenge?
- In my conferences often say the reality increased is the seventh arrival on the interaction between man and machine.
Believe the eighth could well be the addition of sensations tactile.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second-hand as support for the image.
It records tact perfectly!
But there are also technologies which are genuinely aimed to provide tangibilidad to these 'images on the air'. For example, interference several rays ultrasónicos to a specific point the finger gives a sense similar to one feels if someone was soplándole the buds of, but this feeling is still very weak.
Also bracelets to the doll influencing nerve endings detect tissue of the fingers, this also a direction promising.
- has addressed fooled the brain?
Is to think he feels what should feel the moment sees something?
- That is a good idea, still we have not tried.
Here lurks another challenge to we fight long, how to a person physically located a very reduced creates that will a open space, almost without end. Are also working on the idea of the tapes run (not as the of gyms), mobile platforms, as the balloons giants.
For now, deceive the brain is not easy, are still work years.
Is what is work with virtual reality for researchers, many things are a state total conception.
Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
'Rosbalt' continue avant-gardism the 'project San Petersburg', spent citizens, to the forefront art and culture.
This list of the best are brilliant figures art and stage San Petersburg, whose achievements arrive beyond recognition town: often find in Europe without Russia know even.
The new hero of 'Rosbalt' is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, a man barbudo bluefin dress top-down, which is find Museum close Russian, around Garden Summer or meetings fashionable and inauguraciones.
The scoreboards Kirill Miller always attracting crowds, wherever it displayed.
Kirill Miller is one such cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of San Petersburg, creators new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-gardism San Petersburg of the late 1980s - the early 90.
Furthermore, is a urban, whose appearance on the city streets of the inhabitants smiles and lifts all the mood.
Recently, took their a organillo and became the San Petersburg, already organillero has matured to difficult role Bohemian, for their existence, their philosophy and its image.
 - Kirill, why go by the city bluefin dress and not yellow or turquesa, for example?
- chose the red colour because I fashion designer and I dedicate to the appearance and image.
This world the red colour is a compromise between the artist, creators images and society.
Although society, everything which is not a little grey raises aggressiveness and turmoil good properties.
But my provocations are addressed unleashed a conversation.
History my action provocative are a invitation the debate.
 - when comprendiste which debías be artist?
 - In exposure of Culture Nevsky, where they my work.
I realised this was my way.
Then the wave of old artists unofficial had over, and the new, free as I, were still incomprendidos.
I friend artists of the new wave, with the after the outlined Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to 'Pushkinskaya-10', and already ended the new wave.
I sumí the theatre for clothes, music all the genders but not letters.
 And all this coupled on your Clínica of art... - To me was important be on the cultural centre San Petersburg, where were the best minds creative.
On 1995, I territory Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while not had reforms, existed a club artistic musical, a club bohemio, the House of Bohemian San Petersburg.
Many born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember how brought the project Schnur to 'The ear of Van Gogh'.
Schnur and friends danced songs light under phonogram, vestían trousers tight, between them was the currently composer fashionable Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play alive, became 'Leningrad'.
Trachtenberg was cheerleader many programmes before Hali-galivskih.
Gave to Trachtenberg and was the start its great race; basic education and training the received of us.
Gallery D 137 ', the' Club Griboyedov, are relics Clínica the Arte.
There were our employees and customers assiduous.
Am a hero last century, when culture meant something.
2000, the survey was the press, the prize was' The people of our city '.
On nomination 'artist of the Year elected I, ended my culmination.
These is not work new times comfortable; I a man likes the truth honesty and the culture of last century.
Our is times easy to popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but little worship.
 - there your work recognisable. Something
 Very of my paints are hits, which clearly expresses present and the occurrence.
Going to make a exposure scheduled, 'The Russian Museum on clowns'.
The clowns are a status timeless.
I was accessible, but now be is painful and frightening.
But the clowns all embadurna and tragedy removes.
I delighted how grotesque, I ideas grotesque.
For example salvation of the world through a change totalitarian and mandatory clothes.
Now one are for clothes, moving external, but not within the person.
And, perhaps person not should and hand, but escupirle the.
And deception remove when change clothing.
 - Earlier you saw the role organillero of urban. - One city cultured must take a hero.
Who better than I to be!
 - Well but best art commercial can be beautiful?
 - Now the art commercial must be scrupulous, sweet, bear tact.
Witnessing disintegration of cultures.
Before people was formed on herds, the bohemios wanted a thing, the simplones other.
Now all have divided into micro-communities, is difficult please all.
Am not a ticket 100 dollars to taste all.
Now is who quieres like.
Now, each hero of worship has its 100 fan.
 - and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
 - Van to see the abandoned, there it the field sexo-social.
And a cultural event are 300 people, ten thousand never come. As result, less management, less money, all withering.
I my fan, more important is not hoodwinked, not spoil what you achieved.
When was young was such tables to a art-collecting the tapeworms strung on the wall alongside Falk and Larionov.
I started with paints, with which people usually ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
Say culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
No culture, this is another story.
I a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example artists living in poverty and died poverty refused the money only to paint pictures.
I this culture.
 - Kirill, what lacks San Petersburg?
 - Buenos experts culture.
There is a concept: officer culture.
But not all can work culture.
When kings were right all was differently kings perhaps not comprised well culture, but knew need maintain experts courteous.
Moscow now there is very good consultants.
Have people St Petersburg well could be experts, but are closed, because need to a experts top-level correctly assess they and I open path.
Now is thriving the personal taste subjective.
The same Erarta, but the difference is they say honestly not art modern is accepted, some artists who must seek others museums.
 - what is for you San Petersburg?
 - San Petersburg not a capital cultural. Moscow much more culture, there ground.
But on our stones is difficult art grow.
Need cultural and have now more writers readers, it.
Europe is a lot of people with curiosity will exhibitions and concerts.
Our case, is this class tiny.
We must make the art fashionable, as was to the early last century.
The project subsidy with a executed San Petersburg.
Give birth space
The Earth is jeopardise.
Global warming or an asteroid strike murderer.
Caravans spacecraft with human board leave in search of a planet parts.
To preserve humanity is the main question: how continue species at conditions weightlessness or the same planet parts?
Think there is little choice.
Only two are real planets which can be colonised, the less hypothetically.
'These are Venus and Mars, "says the investigator leader Institute State astronomic, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus temperature is 500 degrees.
Can only be live to major altitudes or the orbit Venus... space.
Began address reproductive problems space with flora.
Already half-century ago involved experiments with plants.
Four generations pea cultivated in-orbit not differed nothing varieties land.
After wine rearing insects the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.
1979 sent the room eggs quail to see how develops embryo conditions weightlessness.
Obtain a result polluelo normal.
But then start the problems.
'The problem is this polluelo must find support, must stand on their own feet and start', explained Vladimir Sychev, the director the laboratory Institute biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences Russia.
The not find support, the chicks given volteretas randomly.
And after ten hours newborns a atrophy total instincts.
The chicks not reacted by to the light or the sound.
And misfortune was after four days simply died.
'and twice we born the chicks, but then we because was work impossible there with them',, commenting Vladimir Sychev on failure experiment with the chicks space.
The last time a 'miniarca' biological flew the orbit was 16.
As spring 2013 continue experiments.
However, biosatélite 'Bion' only will travel species a same sex.
A experiment with rats, which were sent the area already foetuses.
On principle not be found nothing supernatural.
'This was precisely the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies as this must be', commenting Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing space rats had offspring.
Yet achieved tackle the problem reproduction directly space.
Is a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their habitat usual, simply cannot make its sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike the small animals, principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and able of creating a fund emotional appropriate.
Experiments similar is not conducted for reasons ethical.
But women travel the area for already 50-year.
The greater risk what spent Tereshkova.
And most precious of humanity is the body female.
Our gaviota, and nobody on Earth could say: if is after a flight the area.
Can or not having a baby after this flight.
'After all, this question nobody has responded', commenting veteran of aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
On June 1964 only after a year flight the area, the first woman a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, also was a cosmonaut.
1988, the second woman a cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in-orbit and even worked on the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
Are few, are counted astronauts who after long flights all has result sake and a generation healthy is growing.
'and if can say more, is dangerous even on flights orbitales', summarises the pilot a cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some ways biotechnology, radiation protection, creating gravity artificial.
The hidrolaboratorio Centre preparation of cosmonaut is a stage mandatory preparation for the flight.
Conditions flotabilidad void, the skills cosmonaut practise work space.
Water simulating the weightlessness.
If a adult water is an environment comfortable yet hostile, for a new-born child is its home element.
Small hombres-anfibio appear confirm lives in the ground arose of the ocean.
There is a connection between the baby is roughly 9 months within its stem the amniotic fluid, because I be easier used then water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment birth until the time of first bathing spend only 2 weeks.
'This is little to forget something, "says Marina Aksenova, monitora swimming newborn.
On short, if the weightlessness is a been more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary gravity, force of gravity.
The weightlessness the muscles abdominal and pelvis is decrepitan very quickly, expulsion of foetus.
Good, omited this, trusting action stimulants to childbirth.
Of course, we give birth a Chamber particular, it boutique.
'and then what?', Valeri Polyakov this original question.
Furthermore, the child also need seriousness artificial.
Without the sense gravity, the body not generates skeleton the system muscular.
A newborn in-orbit is impossible vestirlo with a special made-to-measure, as to exercises adults.
Simply be disenfranchise what is vital to it.
'and this experiment do together, to allow birth of a child a environment strange, lead to bring Earth a disabled, a person absolutely unsuited' envisages the committee chief of bioethics Institute biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth children space is a theoretical issue.
However, with time this will reality, when humans on its ships bound for a planet distant the home for their children foreign-born area.
Leader NKÚ: the inspection of system švarc 'has not the political guilty
On public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and legislation quality, although implementation feeble.
Says so Miloslav Kala, Vice-Chairman of the Control Office Supreme (NKÚ) a interview to Aktuálně.cz.
The law will never perfect ', but implementation must be correct.', my opinion, what we lack 'describes the current situation.
The joint controls inspectors Czechs and Germans also reach conclusions similar.
As example practice incorrect, mention attitude of Petr Nečas towards the system autonomous only be on the role, known as the system švarc '.
 The first Minister said recently the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) not would employers with inspectors. Then, is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated somehow and if prohibits something,, government nor the President can prevent action office must make such checks and require obligations', Kala.
At the committee meeting control Congress of Deputies, you spoke team between the common project Czech and German, the context of which compared the legislation the award public both countries.
What is exactly?
Is a control parallel we make some two years ago.
Said simplified: European legislation regularises how to organise the award public, this is existing legislation each country and then the praxis itself.
We have united all and, although the control is not finalised, achieved differences very interesting. Generally, legislation of our country is' stricter and more complete ', however, the praxis specific parameters is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms not enough with incorporate rules ever-tighter, but is must focus on law enforcement.
What can make fact this project? what believes that are the conclusions?
Common control of this kind could contribute to importance investing efforts applying laws, reduction and improvement limits, although this not impacting.
The economy savings means achieving a appropriate thing reasonably-priced (what not always mean the price is the lowest) to prevent enrichment, and eventually, action criminals.
But not the fact reduce the limit award means we this.
Perhaps because the system is saturated so 'red tape', those want to find failings will system easier if maintained limits as high as now.
You discussing the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the prácticaa of the award public.
How does the system controls Germany?
Is an office like our NKÚ or organises differently?
How bureaux, as the NKÚ, there acts Bundesrechnungshof the (Federal audit), with a organisation similar to our, with a college also, all is it is structured the both different, but principle both offices develop parallel.
Also competences are to some point analógas, but, as Germany has a organisation federal, courts all are even this level. Here differs slightly of our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only monitor the federal money, what here call state funds.
Public funds, administered by regions and municipalities, there, Germany, control the Federal Audit.
On local legislation, is simpler the our?
Generally not I would comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model some aspects, but cannot be state exactly what is better.
Could be better, for example, on quality inspectors?
This certainly not, but, repeat, I like do such comparisons.
Is be said even those countries take as model face a large number of problems.
If not not I would no benefit cooperate with our office, does not?
Regarding legislation of our country, what meant to its Amendment law on the public procedures manifest? somehow its incidence?
Given the validity of this amendment is relatively short, not said control activities.
Since we controls ex-post need a delay.
For now, notes the preparation process of future controls: initiated a 'new tool detecting risks non-economic', we fact 14,000 procedures nearly public have been analysed. Changes will perfectly reflected here, already amending the limits, are some types of conditions selection process and similar.
Does the approval of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a imbroglio to the bureaucratic system?
I believe this law is certainly a right step hope so. And
The problem that can arise is rules tighten '' and impossible deliver.
With the previous rules, persons controlled were linked the contractor (for example, regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every law on procedures respected not public meant rape of budgetary discipline.
Does then sense toughen the law of this way?
Believe not this way.
The system must exclude those to attacking or exploit he and not punish those commit a failure formally, not has incidence decision-making.
Such a system only achieved create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how exceeds this?
See where leads this road begun.
The first minister recently declared that the ODS not would employers with controls the so-called system švarc, with reference to fact be autonomous only on the role. What this mean?
The system švarc 'is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated somehow and, if prohibits something then even the first government minister can prevent action Office to must make such controls and require obligations.
Can say: 'change the law and we allow' but cannot say we as if nothing.
On law on the award public, regulation is rather strict terms of must act formally. And as must be to protect public competition.
But, furthermore, is tragic exclusion candidate with the better supply not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never perfect, but implementation must be correct. This is my opinion, what.
Roads presented plates ice, although are mainly passable
On several places of the Czech Republic roads presented plates ice and snow.
Although most of the are, some ways passable must extreme sharpening caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today morning roads region Karlovy Vary were passable, but involved plates ice and snow.
The temperature free-port and of five and ten degrees below zero rises. During the day slightly thermometers.
Has left nevar on and low layer areas the snow is fine.
Instead, the crestas of the Giant Metálicos snow is nearly the 30 centimeters.
Parts visibility was still bad because of fog, according to information of control centre operations of roads region.
Fast-track R6 and road top-rated the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, recommends be precaution, particularly on some bridges whose surface can be helada and be slope.
Also are all the ways passable second and third category, including roads mountain.
However, some still is tranches with remains ice and snow apisonada.
Is must increase the attention road to areas higher.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
Some roads Bohemia must danger of frost Eastern and areas higher and the mountains can have formed a layer of snow on tracks, reports on its pages the Directorate of roads and motorways.
Operators roads warn drivers on the danger training plates ice, especially in areas higher region Pardubice.
Can result frosts near Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially roads second- and third category.
Roads R / 43 and I / 34 Svitav have been addressed chemically.
Is snow particularly on the roads hill of Krkonoše to Orlické Hory.
Is a layer of snow areas higher apisonada roads Rychnov municipalities of nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
Within the Bohemia Eastern, the sky will today between cleared and partially cloudy, without rainfall.
Temperatures oscilarán generally between three under scratch and a degree soplará positive, a wind weak.
Pilsen region
Roads region Pilsen are passable today morning, although must extreme sharpening caution and will need adapt time.
On the early hours of will tomorrow frosts, temperatures vary between EUR three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and of subsequent decline temperatures, some ways ice also might be covered.
Parts drivers will find fog, but the visibility improve progressively.
This is clear from the information of control centre operations of roads region.
The motorway feasible D5 is almost without restrictions, although recommends oversimplifying the precaution, especially track between the kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of the majority of roads top-rated is dry and without ice.
Within the road Tachov bordering Germany Pilsen and can have tranches with plates ice.
The ways second- and third category are damp,, this case, also warns tranches with plates ice.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially the less crowded ways in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc region
Drivers to areas higher region Olomouc will find snow partially disposes.
After the treatment chemical, still was snow on the port of Červenohorské and towards Videlský kříž.
Operators roads prove snow during night; Šumper road accumulated a three centimetres of snow, according to managers tracks.
Elsewhere region, most ways passable are without restrictions.
'In the higher Šumper the, remnants of snow.
The drivers the port of Červenohorské will find snow environment disposes towards Jeseník ', has confirmed today a operator the administration Šumper the roads ČTK.
On the ground and evening attend the Jesenická also their colleagues and, after the treatment chemical, pistes areas are now higher cleared and mojadas.
Road Olomouc the ways unrestricted passable are of Šternberská drivers should lead caution in the sections forest, where the ways remain spoilt.
Region of Ústí nad Labem went Liberec and region
Roads operators Northern Bohemia have reported various sections complications early morning of.
Beyond places where snowed or, according to the database police the mountain road Telnice and Knínice between the Ústí nad Labem went region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even low-lying areas, for what ice and snow obviously remain the road. Instead, low-lying areas, especially Southeast central massif Czech, no problems and roads are generally dry.
By the mmento not have occurred complications of service.
Operators of roads warned the presence ice around Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, conditions have been ideals during the evening. During the day is expected rain and snow melting and evening heaven will cleared and will ice.
From the roads general announced unfavourable conditions in road R / 13 border between the region of Ústí nad Labem went Liberec and.
Between the road Telnice and Knínice had to be cut in the trees had arqueado on the way with the burden snow.
Šimon Ornest: our concerts want accumulate positive energy
Is says less than a month will the of, what is on this?
Is only one of between many other news alarmist to the we like maintaining.
The group The TAP TAP we like rather joke on this and we like say we are the only group world achieved found positive energy to postpone order of the world or to.
Furthermore, December original project organizáis a really: three concerts against order of world.
Can explain our readers?
Is a act planned state charitable we two years.
We decided to take the potential marketing final the the timetable Mayan enunciated for the 21 December to the 11: 10 the tomorrow.
The previous day, 20 December the 21 hours, organise 3 concerts simultaneous Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Will approximately the same time where ends the timetable Mayan on the island Kiribati, Oceans Pacific, 12 p.m. ahead of our time-zone.
How happened this idea?
Initially was my idea later went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Also to found positive energy and avoid order of world, also want reflect, with society, on the state that leave the world our children.
With occasion the end the timetable Mayan we also created a collection only of articles: boots, t-shirts, pockets and original against the key rings of can acquired on www.e-tap.cz, differently relying.
The group The TAP TAP, together with others interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the of, entitled 'End the world cancelled'.
Is currently popular on YouTube, will hear the beneficial concerts?
Clear yes, and fair the last, good, always the and not the world...
The cantarán all the interpreters the same time the three concerts.
Anthems is enlazarán each other simultaneously thanks to the broadcasting particular live on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets the role protagonist of Jesus the video clip, where sings Xindl X...
How arose this cooperation?
Work together even with other figures cultural stage Czech, beyond organising many acts concerts... beneficial and
We all our efforts in participate in this project.
Demonstrated most of them interest and I amused work with us.
Why be spent money raised concerts against order the world?
Equipment for the Centre education barrier-free Studeo, term in its sixth year running civilian with partnership TAP Jedličkův ústav.
Pupils school Jedličkův ústav are regularly the visit of teachers with the amusing and interesting performing.
Pupils not have sufficient resources to pay teachers and we efuerzo to this.
Within the framework completion of the Jedličkův projects ústav be a building independent we move with this project.
Each concert several groups acting and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We drawing up a programme is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example Prague act Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
To more details consult www.kpks.cz. you,
Is You scheduled some other 'action spectacular' similar future?
First proceed in May in the festival Pražské jaro, so here surely prepare a attractive programme with guests interesting.
Next year we would also play Bohemian the National Hall New York and personally while we United States, I would amplify with action Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, until now have acted for example Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The TAP TAP, however, is a group disabled.
How is logistics and organisation of these journeys?
Is not as difficult how can appear.
Five Members wheelchair, the chairs must travel compartment to baggage and we much weight, boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly ready, which it puzzles me.
Even Moscow, where we returned recently, went all without problems.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the various attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What you you have found?
Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, all works better than here; in Russia we witnessed, this, is.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full barriers, there remains frequent be a person moves single by the city centre to a wheelchair electric.
Something as and is, for example, give preference someone on wheelchair on lift, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership strives to focus attention the problems of the disabled.
What aspects must take example of most progressive countries?
Many aspects in we behind...
But is important to mention perfecting and the improvement depends always of persons directly.
On London and Madrid is very normal people with a disability serious switches alone in public and can go to the museum, wherever...
But is not very common which a large number of disabled participate in social lives actively here with The TAP TAP it a step ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is a thing, but when the moment arising eminent sportspeople, artists, players political or lawyers begin to change everything.
Until now, are isolated cases of people have a great willpower.
The group The TAP TAP is currently popular, but looking years backwards, what you led to form the Group in 1998?
Entered carer as on Jedličkův ústav, where was quite young people my around wanted engage something.
And since I musician, raised, others saxofón the founded a group amateur with a colleague.
And with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, we was a little hands (laughter).
However, the popularity not to recent years, or I mistaken?
Is truth that helped us quite connect with singers famous and also work actively to promote the group.
We concluded that the work unseen, is as if not.
Thanks aid the European Union, we afford to furthermore teachers quality, equipment, etc
Do you had intention of go as far with The TAP TAP?
From the principle saw the potential, can be something otherwise.
The showbiz is full things are each other.
Is logical, its way, everything new welcomes caution and time-consuming in acceptable.
Little extraordinary things, but I daresay The TAP TAP is one.
The impression someone to see us first is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because the disabled are not abandoned beings suffer and should have compassion.
People is capable of a full life and develop, provided by course, for the means.
I always say if something I goes well to disabled, then, is not only progress for them, but to all society.
Is Ayudó the fact which is you a leader demanding, as I describes many people?
If do a work of quality, we must be rigorous many aspects and demanding discipline.
Think it perfectly normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the forefront clouds and when acquiesce must go two days test go to proof preparatory and long travelling and concerts the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But this is how works everywhere, each group wants work and achieve something.
Currently the group The TAP TAP 20 members.
How many were already in the beginnings of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group opened, people enters and leaves, cannot avoid.
Who has will and want find open-door always the
Will the day before the expected end of the world, the Thursday 20.12.2012 to the 21 p.m.
Will take place the Incheba Arena of Prague, Fléda of Brno and 12 in Ostrava and participate Plynojem and others musicians groups Czech
The three cities connect the veiled through videoconference to sing together song the group The TAP TAP 'End of world cancelled'
The objective of concert is gather necessary resources to finance equipment multifunctional of central barrier-free education STUDEO on Jedličkův ústav of Prague, which cost rises 25 million CZK.

Poland and the cosmos.
's meeting of ministers countries European Space Agency held the week accept Poland as twelfth Member of the ESA. Is the second Member State ESA of bloc of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became full member the 12 November 2008).
Poland initiated intensive cooperation with ESA 1994 and during subsequent years involved in committee of projects Agency.
However, the road Poland to the cosmos started long before.
Enthusiasts already Polish involved flights the area before WWII, although not always understand his work.
I remember, for example, the conference A. Šternfeld the Observatory Warsaw astronomic, the 6 December 1933, presented its ideas on the study pioneer 'Introduction to cosmonautics'.
Ideas of young engineer (born the 1905) left assistants indifferent and, after years, Šternfeld recalled Dr Jan Gadomski was the only had shown interest.
The year 1934 Šternfeld achieved France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for their 'Introduction to cosmonautics'.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier became later a great promoter of Astronomy and cosmonautics.
Published hundreds articles magazines Polish and wrote a number books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known worldwide and contribution science was rewarded when was behalf one of the cráteres of the hidden side the moon.
Already year 1925 built on Poland a dresina was to be employer-based of an engine rockets.
Unfortunately, is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not the project destalles.
Is not clear if rocket was to be used for grubbing the dresina or for braking.
Information on this dresina merely collection on the press the time.
From the year 1933 artillery Polish began to spent missiles.
Research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia cooperation with the Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From retained material, research came to stage tests practices.
However, with the arrival of German troops, was research.
The year 1937 the press specialised the prototype a missile hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza', of author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were military use engines for missiles.
Little earlier war, the Committee adviser provisional scientific (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) responsible for all technical projects rockets to military use and all the work coordinated.
The Committee was founded on 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted for starting war.
Others studies devoted to cosmonautics were on the Polish press after the war thanks to the work Society Polish of astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 of the magazine Problemy refers first society with four articles very extensive efforts astronáutica.
One of them, of Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to cosmonautics.
At the time already launched projects satellites artificial and was obvious that research cosmic was a discipline prospects.
Since early 1956 Polish Society of astronáutica (PTA) aspired part Federation International astronáutica (founded on 1951) and autumn of the same year PTA became full Member.
The following year the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice-President of the International Federation of astronáutica.
Played office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTAs involved significantly on the development of rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), a success and became the first Polish rocket which carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was concluded 1957 and launched first 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a heyday of 1,800 metres, around 80 cm and not reached the 5 kg.
Later, was build RM-1A version and summer of 1959 the proof airlines RM-2 rockets two-stage desert of Błędów.
Rocket measured 1.4 metres and weighed a 11.5 kg
Other developing rocket would be studied real scientific. Rocket RM-34 was to play a heyday of 14.5 km and its mission would control wind.
However, 1962 suspended the work.
The successor early rockets such RM was the rocket Meteor-1, built during the years 1962 and 1965.
Was designed as rocket two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and a burden initial 32.5 kg
Developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed each other for the space available for appliances scientists.
The rocket Meteor-1A the space available to the volume era of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of where it is 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The heyday maximum in the three types era of 37 km
Between the years 1965 and 1968 at the Air Institute rocket Meteor-2, the first air proof began October 1970.
Rocket Meteor-2 had a initial burden 380 kg and was able a weight useful 10 kg until 60 km.
Subsequently built the version Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Is necessary also mention Poland entry COSPAR Committee for Space Research in 1960 and training COSPAR national committee years after two.
Programme Interkosmos, Poland joined space research cósmico on artificial satellites Soviets and, 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension law on social work is not the solution.
The week the judged constitutional suspended the traabajos social law.
The resolution awakened a heated discussion in society.
Will certainly be interesting examining the problem existed since a broader view.
Economic systems liberal EU, like the globalised world, on the principle of greater economic competition and less legislation.
Consequently, this means the different ways systems economic and national economic conflict permanent.
The cause is the free trade principle and of free movement private capital unlimited, together with financial speculation.
The effect of large disparities in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation the manufacturer, with the goods imported cheap to gap and for this' causes a bajadda 'the price of competitor with the aim of be with most of the market and thus increase profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, delocalise production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of work compared with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital is not social responsibility and, with this, is not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates, grows State necessarily social spending.
All this conducive the full disinterest of entrepreneurs for pay taxes and damage social and economic caused to profit.
The situation is universally so known that is not necessary statistics.
Practices little handle of private capital create situations, certain economies, when governments of these countries forced to compete with the aim of artificially reduce the social level of the own population and thus attracting capital abroad the country.
Said otherwise, governments are private capital available to its own population disregarding the social decline.
This is patent on all on changes laws.
The aim is to force people to accept dictated of private capital, especially as to wages.
This takes place, partly through the system obligation economic case long term unemployment; using the right restricted employees rights work.
The result is a increasing poverty alongside the increasing differences between rich and poor.
For a number of years, are Germany delivery points of food for poor people cannot be with their own work.
The number of people receiving such assistance arrives already million.
Under the increase competitiveness German economy produces a case quite: people employed with a salary so under the state must pay rest to minimum necessary for survive.
Was public a scandal of this kind on the situation of employees ancillary of Parliament German.
Savings measures practically all States southern EU lead undoubtedly the same situation. Persons pressured by decline social status abysmal, forced to emigrate and the nineteenth or malvivir paid in the limit rotten society, hoping someday private capital investor reaches the country.
Need preguntrarse where is?
The case of other EU countries, then poverty happens of a country to another or is never Chinese, since, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or African still work by a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Theories Liberals and the media claim nauseam the state ought not capital bring the economy, to economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth-and-nail the thesis the state ought not intervene on the economy meddled on control.
Then is necessary wonder if private capital influences with its selfishness on the march policy and therefore around the state.
Here the answer is clearly yes.
Proof is the existence of lobbies, practice very powerful and omnipresent, all states.
The result is a straits to provide corruption, mutual the favors, of legislation is practically reprehensible everywhere but not is punishable.
Germany the situation is: state ministries, lack of financial resources, responsible wording projects bill legal private companies, which are often linked with industry.
Such projects laws are adopted after the Bundestag, Parliament German.
Of this way, all power not from the people, as announces constitutions of democracies Western, but the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
Is obvious democracies with a liberal-minded are rapidly describing situation how Appiános to his work The crisis Roman Republic times Caesar and Pompeii: 'the State wore time disintegrating and administrations thinks force'.
To change bribes, favors achieved illegitimately and help finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people going into the polls with the vote apalabrado of advance... had not people with nature aspirara to an administration once because of this disorganisation, the been spent eight months without consuls... began be seriously the sole remedy for a very serious situation was autocracy and need choose a man energetic '... Although Appiános thought in Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy for always autocracy.
The conclusion, in antiquity, is society in today inconsiderate preferences the individual benefits without taking account of common interests.
The private capital is not able, essence understand and claim the benefits all society.
The result is the same that the then, a decadence of unprecedented elite, without a effort to deeply reforming it.
The causes booming fascist and communist regimes must sought therefore unbridled liberalisation systems economic twentieth the nineteenth and.
With respect to the current situation, is possible consider disappearance of these systems benefit of a democracy, as a pause defined, waiting next blow.
The fact really damning is the elite current ignores losses hundreds of thousands in lives, disasters social and humanitarian of the we witnessed and crimes against humanity, as the know the history and the latest.
The suspension of the law on public is not the solution contracts; at least not long term.
Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally as within the EU, the government Czech Republic obliged to follow seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
Is the solution reforms specific socio-political, capital reinforce both the participation influence the state as the government citizens and undermine the monopoly position of private capital in society benefit of state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
'That nothing comes from violence and nothing arises ever could' (not nothing violence and nothing could do), Sting on their song Fragile and whose refrain reads' Let's do not forget how fragile we are '(not forget how fragile are).
'If my children not would wars, not would be no' Gutele Schnaper, wife Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed the year 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and Gaza, have arisen, as always, reactions various.
A, by Israel, argues for the right of self-defence and encasilla Palestinians the role terrorists. The other supports Palestinians and claims racism by the state Israel, genocide against Arabs Palestinians and waltz Israel of state terrorist.
Not I focus on who is guilty offal recur periodically and who is victim. After all, people today of Israel, including the autonomous territories, born within the situation current policy and not lived the early violence.
My intention is offer readers a look behind-the-scenes, a look to discover who thwarted tensions which are dragging for 95 years (calculated from the statement Balfour in November 1917) a small acreage Middle-East.
Some of my considerations are landmarks, others in conclusions I reached on the basis of my own way of understand the issue, on who or what group of people is the driver main developments modern history.
The history of humanity the history of the power struggles is first.
Each time can find Alexandra the or a Napoleon.
But is not longer so clear is if were always these characters the directing their steps autonomously or if behind its throne someone which action tended their towards a certain objective.
Must accept inhabit a time which concentrates wealth world's hands few individuals and this concentration of money and power this means, has been reached a alone generation.
Of between these families astronomically rich highlights a could be more prominent (if still anyone behind, not know, but not well): the Rothschild.
Not writes much around them.
Of course.
The 1990 nineteenth-century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associate their behalf with acts criminals very serious. Power and wealth, or both, I criss-crossed the backs, which for they always meant strengthening.
Have participations important almost all the central banks and countries where unrepresented declared or is preparing a war: before the attack to Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack Iraq were 5, after overthrow Qaddafi only were four, but meanwhile Russia linked the Central Bank the government Russian.
Anyone has tried oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central-bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession onwards to money-printing and was murdered on 1865 the theatre.
JFK began money-printing and wanted suspend the system Federal Reserve (EDF) and was murdered on 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting sue the EDF by have triggered the great economic crisis 1929.
Seeking power global led them during the years 1859 - 1871 charting a plan with three Wars, designed by masón Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war espoused objective eliminate the major Royal throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially Britain, and the third proposed reduce the land between population half-a-million and billion people (this amount of slaves to its well-being and luxury would and not many resources energy) and the creation universal a religion (the ecumenism is nothing more a such solution blueprint for) and adopting the absolute powers.
The method with operating the group families wealthier, together with the Rothschild, remains dynamics crises of and subsequent offer a solution ab (order face - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however erroneous, and always a deterioration. If not, enough remember the EDF was created not to allow a crisis as the 1907.
So, following the success murder of the heir the throne Austro-Hungarian Francisco Fernando, Sarajevo and after, result erupted WWI, trashed the Tsarist Russia with the revolution Bolshevik.
WWI ended summarily and unjustified militarily and economic capitulation of Germany (wars to end the were already Tsarist Russia unnecessary) and subsequent dismemberment of the superpower Central Europe, the rule Austro-Hungarian.
To prepare the ground WWII, allowed bankers and politicians established, covertly, a situation conflictual following the huge repairs imposed on Germany war, created optimum conditions for radicalisation bodies impoverished. Subsequently, I was with serve Germans the solution Führer the, which was sufficiently strong and simple and indicated guilty and to after a build Czechoslovakia comprising several nationalities with strong should play minority and represented German so well the role fifth column, which ignited flame and caused the outbreak of war.
The late nineteenth-century, the Rothschild fueled the foundation the movement Zionist, a branch applying to training of a state Jewish, predominately on region of former Judea Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The statement Balfour mentioned earlier paved the to mass immigration Jews to Palestine and began the early conflicts with the population Arab.
Occurred attacks both parts terrorist.
Erupted WWII: is difficult whether Hitler threw too to what had tied international bankers initially or if all part of a plan. However, the suffering Jews European concentration fields created optimum conditions for acceptance the state Jewish global society.
Israel was founded officially 1948 similarly the way war reparations imposed Germany paved the way towards WWII, with the proclamation the state Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers flooded start, the Jewish nation, like WWII, would fall victim first line, now together with the population Arab or generally Muslim Middle-East.
Israel is a laboratory immense, a machine welding and chaos, not only within its country, but also international level. Take as example divide so blunt how sympathizers and opponents of Israel.
Who is guilty and who the victim the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? where injustice engenders injustice violence endless, if the start all was greed some individuals and seeking power.
This is must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its mandataries, because, as is our country, international bankers only have their election candidates.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example politician fascist, loyal to international bankers, everything for war Iran and, given Iran is Member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten becomes a global conflict and, given Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where happens the 20% of oil global navigation row has only two miles across), lead to the destruction of the economy world.
Under what light are now the words 1994 David Rockefeller: 'All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.'
The new order world imagination is a world of ladies and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful people part of the financial aristocracy well well-off.
A world where each new individual it sown a chip at birth controlling all its be.
'and obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on right-hand or forehead, cannot buying and sell, unless the behalf of this monster or the figures of its behalf.
Is must understand: who has two fingers of, which adds the numbers this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is 600 sixty-six '.
Film Argo: if is crude, draw to Hollywood
In November 1979 a group demonstration students Islamists occupied the embassy American Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be to change dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to US, country which had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the administration American the situation had no positive perspective: throw the Shah overboard not could allow me, since if I had, endangered the trust of its allies elsewhere.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where revolution had led to the Constitution the system theocratic, was not.
Was a coup prestige of the United States, subsequently intensified even more with the failed of freeing hostages by force.
Diplomats imprisoned were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention government Algeria.
US, its destination caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure Iran contributed decisively defeat Jimmy Carter face Ronald Reagan the presidential 1980.
The film 'Argo' the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza a episode this history, which reaped a small success Latin.
Little earlier occupy the embassy, escaped six employed the building.
After a complicated journey, ended on residence embassy Canadian.
CIA, cooperation with the Canadian authorities, achieved disabuse them of Iran, for this helped a history covert a point extravagant: left passports Canadian, as Members team film outlining the location the country for running-in a overproduction science-fiction.
Mix gender
The plan redesignated expert 'exfiltración' Tony Mendez required cooperation Hollywood.
To the lie appear truthful, wrote on the film project specialist billboard were press conferences, society of production fictitious had even a real office.
The details on the operation remained secret long, the film has made to memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of Affleck is a mix singular of several genders.
A political realistic; thriller, a so-called caper movie ', history a episode which went well (an example deception can be the number Ocean's Eleven).
The film combine the moods. Are a Tehran well-documented sequences. The sequence of appropriations are photographs flagship times events, which were embodied similarly the film; no many differences here.
By the other, scenes typical of Hollywood a both lighter, marked by irony and mild exaggeration.
And furthermore, scenes of the central CIA and other institutions: men trajeados analysing the situation table in the corridors negotiations office, telephone...
Ben Affleck has achieved restart its career of a excellent way.
The actor, which had been mocked, has become a director respectable and act stopped be the target of ironic comments.
ARGO is its third largometraje, after 'farewell small, farewell' 2007 and the thriller 'The Town. City thieves' (2010).
The same time, is the first film action Affleck the not takes place on the city Boston, where fattened up.
Also, sensitivity capture the atmosphere of characteristic putting managers old above films standards Hollywood.
And Affleck demonstrates on Argo, where Tehran 'wheel' Canada.
The better scenes of the film take place on the streets, reconstruction developments truthful. The sequence lead-in the embassy is impressive capacity transparent that, the same time, trasmite emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight arises when, somewhere, is a step history.
Affleck and their collaborators achieve similar effect on the scenes fictitious (the team imposter on the bazaar of Tehran).
Too too action places
The director had to accept the fact a history explained offers much sense film the scenes more intriguing.
And manages quite well. To times adds something to reality: here is not all so elegant (the scene where lurks the crisis airport Tehran, the deviation a call Latin and pursuit following traced become madness).
The weakness of Argo is the disorder arises of the need show too too action places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very facetious as contributors role Hollywood, although his characters deserved more area and not are, alone in this film.
For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little layout dramatic, but is a Amelio to can continue moderate interest, value fulfilment and the style retro a thriller it evokes the 1970.
But collapse, this will be difficult.
As evocation a real story and as proof exaggerated of can be notions of omnipresence and omniscience secret services, is sufficient.
Rules bloated balloons for the, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year submits a survey on banking charges more absurd, now announce the competition decided on 'the regulation or ideas more absurd of workshop EU'.
'we happened after the last event, EU intends to adopt a share of 40% women jobs direction European large companies', explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer survey.
Between the absurd nonsense that are nominated is, for example, the recent court decision European unify insurance policies male-female.
Until now, women aventajaban better prices sure life because represent objectively a minor risk.
'Other ideas incredible of workshop of the EU can be proposals for people until the end this year'.
The election will take place to end of February 2013 ', reported Nacher.
Between the rules controversial the EU is, for example, the addition mandatory biocomponents the fuel, as result damages the environment; another ban is using thermometers mercury lifelong only because contain a small number of a substance sombre dangerous or the guideline size cages of hens, which contributed to substantial increase the price of eggs this year.
Has criticised the ban factual use the expression 'butter tartinable' or the withdrawal of the bulb classical the shops.
A banana of quality must take a 14 centimetres.
The apparatus of the Union take such decisions often under pressure and lobby mercantile or industry whose demands Brussels are advocated normally for some State or States (the Czech Republic, even with the veto threat, claims the requirements banks).
The interests a lobby were behind the request, for example bananas higher-quality should have EU length by less 14 centimeters and not could presented 'curvaturas abnormal.
The European Commission defended saying this only seeking harmonise national rules homogenized not to date complicaban only the market.
Rules referring to fruit and vegetables EU, despite opposition of some States, have softened on the basis the existing directive entails a waste of edible.
The candidate to win the survey might be prescribing the US last year whereby the balloons inflables traded is compulsory warn children lower eight-year are not allowed to inflarlos without supervision a adult.
The US referring here to a study American whereby, speaking toys, the balloons are the main cause of death child by asphyxiation.
Is also a restriction applicable similar the use of matasuegras by children of until 14 years.
Wheezes curious born even within our country
Equally absurd the regulation concerning European officials: anyone any role official EU cannot use designation of Macedonia. To hurt the sensitivity of Greece, must speak FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, cooperation with partnership economists liberal laissez-faire, nominó on the survey, between some proposals absurd mentioned above, prescribing the Union on the volume of provisions food territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of provisions food can such Republic territory Czech same day of our entry to the EU.
After, the Czech Republic overshot, for example, the volume canned established for mushrooms, was a threat of substantial fine.
To the organisers of the survey also I interested the occurrence paying countries access the sea and the idea of providing funding for subsidies.
This kind of ideas not arose at Brussels but Prague.
'we disadvantaged for not have sea.
Asked the European Union compensation ', declared autumn 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav shovels (ČSSD).
The argued in our country was much grain and, as result so-called intervention buying, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to shovels, since the Czech Republic is far ports, the EU should paid hundreds of billion.
The European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a tender for the purchase of the cereal countries not have access the sea.
The subsidy for a subsidy was proposal municipalities Ministry for the to local development addressed Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is intended to drafting applications subsidies Brussels.
EU: prescriptions are a exception rare
The guidelines of Member States are often, efforts criticism EU regulations and also a functioning and development more effective throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the recovery subsidies the EU for projects have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but Member States have achieved in negotiations on Budgets.
The Czechs also up the heartstrings, likewise other Union countries, the fight for the right to DOC of their goods traditional, although our country has not always been victorious of these struggles.
Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, defended with success DOC the mascarpone of, to go ahead and change Olomouc the behalf the national rum, whose tradition we back to the 19th century, and was renamed 'tuzemák'.
Only products from distilled of sugar cane can be so-called rum, but not those facts from beet of sugar.
The list official Designations of Origin EU, together with cheeses feta and protection known worldwide, the mazapán of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, are already for example cookies of Karlovy Vary, carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and the variety of hops of Žatec.
As Maras protected the EU, can be proud of the bread of jengibre of Pardubice and Karlsbad Hořice V Podkrkonoší.
People want save Republic, but am a amateur, States Okamura
Senator, how happened stand for election to President?
Not be Senator or President.
If our country, then not would my candidacy.
But cannot bear robs see how in recent twenty years our country, how thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and retirement.
Not had ambitions politician.
When see a not I like, attempt a solution to change.
And since I 40 years and my candidacy is independent, the only way of change things is stand as Senator or President.
The Senate has already arrived, but little then has way towards Presidency.
Does eschewing persons voted?
Always said my candidacy to the Presidency depended of election results Senate.
Later stated if out elected Senator, submit my candidacy to the Presidency.
But my objective is not the role function is the tool with which can do reality my own ideas.
Therefore need greater influence possible and the mandate stronger possible.
The problem is not only be a nation criticise café or before television, but we drive down anyone to initiate change.
This is the media, you discredit and confuse the free expression with freedom lying.
Me says I bribed journalists or I been adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Of their ideas.
The fight presidential financial thesis criminal and responsibilities politicians and declaration property above 20 million.
Must change the law.
As chairman not has this competition Senate and only the whole can propose laws.
How solve?
As citizen, I been part of a group pressure for the job guide recognise as work autonomous, and.
The problem is the policy: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right-wing or left rejecting purpose and this affects citizens.
Independent candidate, have greater potential to obtain support of all parliamentary groups.
Without encasillamientos or party dogmas, I capacity to choose something of each party best for our country and implement it.
Viewed rather a man right-wing or left-wing?
From terms Czech, I impression that the people I believes left-wing more.
For me not importance slightly already left-wing or a little right-wing.
What I matters is ideal forward.
Not me whether someone is right-wing or left-wing, I unite people.
Always support any solution openly good, whether the proposal next KSČM or SDGs and, similarly, be against bad ideas.
Makes joke when says of continue populist is.
But is not demonstrating what say?
When creates a business plan for the company, have also certain objectives and ideals.
And you try to acercarte to them.
Others called populism, but all the proposals speak already work worldwide or acquaintances experts speak of them.
But without the support the only Parliament watchwords.
And with this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or you if to people and speaks with them, achieved, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
Not I choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to them my part in this.
If elected President, not have problem in organise a broadcasting live on television which ask party leaders parliamentarians legitimaran the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials judges and State tax.
And, possibly they would communicate why not want.
If a character strong indicated disputes, can be pressure stage.
Consider direct election of the President, which has been a success pressure public.
The same time say only am a amateur am not or a genius not a intellectual.
To my views and ideals attempt find allies.
I start policy and attempt obtain greatest possible support for my programme.
Attempt getting things forward myself, but not well, within six years leave and the private sector.
Sounds a little as if Okamura out save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
Know with not do nothing, I therefore visited a number of personalities known, for if best animaran to stand to Senate.
Was to Radim Jančura but refused because had much work.
By my least I supported journalist research Jana Lorencová, which highlighted fraud light oils heating.
I tabled on the basis people is really unsatisfied, now I the balance.
Sixty% of the population voted and, those made, voted representatives of the establishment.
The Senate are two the sector independent.
People chose the Senate, so will complicated achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, as for example direct election of mayors or governors.
Does form its own party?
I have not yet considered because not have time to see the past unblemished of each Member potential party nor I am money.
Not have the money or for the campaign the Presidency, on my mind transparently only 20 kroner.
Is not money?
Speaks statements of ownership, how is theirs?
Believe my private property a 60 million.
Prague I a ground valued at 25 million, a floor valued ten million, another floor restriction eight million, a collection of artworks with a value of ten million, a Aston Martin of a 3.5 million and a Superb worth Škoda a million, and I a couple.
Incidentally, I have a Aston Martin because was my dream youth. Always I liked James Bond, leading this car, was gallant with women and, the same time, fighting the evil words and deeds and injustices.
Is leads a Aston Martin, their property is valued 60 million and not has money to the campaign?
You says to change Republic but not want too money.
Is not very convincing.
Not I 15 million for campaign.
Need I endeudarme?
The campaign I have already 2.5 million.
The fact without any sponsor who too interest in my programme.
And not I obligation of pay campaign with money of my pocket.
Costs campaign cover essentially what get of pay Senator.
But could not live. For example, could not pay English my son school, which costs 30,000 monthly kroner.
If I just earn, I would as candidate.
So will with business activity to live?
Not said earlier that was this activity?
This has nothing to do with a salary greater.
As I promised, partly I made my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute spring.
People I outside the Samaritan which salvase the Republic.
But I also need living.
How accustomed to win monthly as employer?
200,000 and 400,000, I continue gaining.
If President, then would business.
Can consult all the interview the Saturday of Práva.
The study MVRDV architecture the real adventures not only the forefront - the example library of Spijkenisse and the newly completed 'mountain of books' - 2 photos
'I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and, finally, something interesting to do', States Lisette Verhaig, a transeúnte through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, technical IT a large company located close library, points: 'furthermore, the building is beautiful'.
But I wonder why we need a library today.
All Internet, tablets and e-books.
It by happy to those libraries passé?
Spijkenisse, a city bedroom situated the doors of Rotterdam scarcely deserves a fleeting visit, has the dubious honour having taken a record for forget.
The population 80,000 inhabitants presents the rate of literacy lowest of the Netherlands.
For counteracting this shameful, some years decided contribute somehow general culture and copying the represented fake appear seven bridges on euro notes part armed concrete miniaturas decoradas.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And was as policy-makers decided only was a opportunity to improve statistics: had to build a library!
Winy Maas, study MVRDV Dutch architecture, all a master the art of the diagrams and responsible rods buildings fun while cynics, took the issue with its usual serenity and appeared the presentation the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and smiles.
And while the jury looked perplexed around and encogía shoulders, Maas proceeded to piling books size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: 'Dear,
Here the you, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years after, the mountain of billion closed 30 the runway.
This part revitalisation, project supplementing with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and asset-backed.
To early November the mountain of books was awarded second prize 'Best Library of NL 2012'.
Furthermore, the draft is also nominated the 'Dutch National Wood Award 2012'.
Of this way, small city history lacking hitherto not had nothing more to offer pedestrian a zone post-modern and a local government incredibly ugly following whose façade blanche one intuiría rather a central dairy now has a work contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is is a paradise books under quesera.
Well there is lift we transported fair the heart of this mountainous massif, but the real football-loving the reading space and not use it, but prefer merged with its topography each step escalation to the top.
The internal completely acristalado is bright and easy of cover with view, the ground brick recocido and the glamour street lamps support unequivocally the public condition library.
The urban environment perfect.
The look can reach visualise the park, dogs and children play football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
'Normally the bookshelf are ready throughout the façade and the focus opens a huge room obscure generally usually something uncomfortable and impersonal', States Winy Maas.
What us is put upside down classical configuration space and draw the area of reading Interior abroad.
The mountain is well taken: the are offices, the Internet library, the club chess, the Education Centre environmental and room maintenance.
Deserve special mention black bear shelves the role padding mural, parapet and barandilla the same time.
View, the tact and the nostrils are strangers.
Even the architects and civil engineers more the day shackle the forefront when hear speak of this material unknown.
'We wanted work with materials recycled', explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city Spijkenisse.
And is as a day on a farm Friesland, we have the by-product appropriate from agriculture.
For many years, the greenhouses and the fields of the Netherlands uses fabric plastic scarce millimetres thick as basis to restrain the root crops.
Is a materials cheap and efficient.
This fabric hard fine two stations and after dismissed.
To the library this fabric prensó, first such quantities, to achieve planks four centimeters thick.
With the heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a materials obscure, homogeneous and resilient than smells a mix car new and zapatilla of sport.
Following 105 rungs is the mountaintop.
This route continuous almost half metres around the mountain awaits us the reward: from cafeteria not only has fantastic view of the city, but it can also be enjoy the flavoursome Dutch croquetas and their ficus planted huge pots.
These create an environment Nice the couple maintained humidity air adequate to this mountain of literature.
Donations to a new soul
'Although perish the thought given their hypermarkets acristaladas, this building is a project exemplary regarding ecology', indicates Trouborst.
Heating and cooling necessary gained from geothermal.
Despite the mountain of books is located under enormous glass pyramid, even the days more sunny the sun only shines during few p.m. inside.
The huge cerchas timber on sense cross-cutting the glass serve to give shadow and absorb the majority rays the sun.
This creates a internal climate comfortable.
The rest is thing of the shutters automatic.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker sector IT, already has dared to put on the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Equally, the professor of medicine traditional Chinese Cynthia Bogarde visited the library. It qualifies the 'Boekenberg' and the 'late soul' of Spijkenisse.
The reason is, the opening that took place a couple of weeks, invited all city residents to donate a book their private collection.
This to fill, the gaps optical of a library yet with its full archive; currently has 70,000 exemplary.
The concept has significance deep.
Are full shelves.
'not is nothing worse than a library half-empty', says the architect Winy Maas.
'I believe thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a link with this building.
All know their book forms part library.
Although only there for embellish.
The study has achieved MVRDV a success in the discipline prevails slang the specialised is known as' creation identity '.
City Spijkenisse has writing a part history of literature.
Whatever uneducated young and.
A starting point for shape the identity.
Szabo: 'The Germans must play a role stronger'
Germany abstained on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, US expert relations UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin diplomatic position rather sharper.
Deutsche Welle: early weekend, Germany hinted which vote against the proposal to give territories Palestinians State status UN observer.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany non-support what Israelis have fact Gaza.
Now, to the special relationship unites the country with Israel, Germany should beware.
But the same time nor supports the American position.
Germany wanted demonstrate independence without be too critical with Israel.
During the uprising Libya on March 2011, Germany abstained when it was was of establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared NATO.
Is Le is difficult Germany posturing clear when are at stake important international issues?
Other, is.
This is because currently re-allocating its foreign policy, alienating a policy led,, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what further hinders things is Europeans have consistent policy and uniform.
Therefore, Germans are at a crossroads.
Of them expects play Role more independent, but are unaccustomed.
Believe still probing what its role, but have already started way towards a policy external normal '.
A foreign policy similar to the countries as France or Britain.
What means foreign policy 'normal' from terms German?
Is a policy when is national interests, persuades to defend different positions to the United States or its European partners.
Believe German foreign policy is a powerful motivation economic policy, is say, exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or East.
Economic interests Germans are to some point different from other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Are these economic interests have influenced the position taken regarding the conflict Middle-East and the vote of the UN?
By a hand, Germany has large markets Middle-East, especially Gulf.
For this reason careful and not must be into of Arab public opinion nor elites Arabs.
This is important, of course.
But I would such importance which is not a relationship perfectly unilateral.
However, yes play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relation to US the abstain on important decisions and vote on Palestine?
Believe Europe and even US German, the position enjoys a huge degree understanding.
Therefore think has occurred drastic a break as Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has achieved curry a respect.
After all, all this has only demonstrate a country which take seriously as international player and whose interests.
Europe is different views Palestinian initiative.
Instead, US has clearly shown for a veto.
Is there disparity of views between US and many European nations?
Have always existed these disparities due to internal policy American.
Believe government Obama shows secret a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the situation policy live here clearly cannot defend government in public this position.
I think the genuine disparity of opinions has no the importance attributed to it.
Looking at relations between Obama and Israeli Premier Netanyahu, Obama is to nothing enthusiastic with the policy develops.
Is Le is difficult Germany reconcile the close relations with Israel and United States, for a hand, with the position of its main partners at the EU, for another?
Think this making difficult for Germans.
Of course be a little easier for Germans if a European policy consistent and homogenous, but is not the case.
Therefore, not have the possibility part of higher BLS, but must boost things from its own position.
This is precisely what are doing now with the euro.
I believe the future Germany assume a leading role forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is nothing easy for Germany, whether simply by the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tough subject.
But the Germans have clear must play the role of contained independent.
Is Germany itself into the role of important international player? does actually Germany assume a role protagonist?
Or perhaps I remains proving difficult accept leadership?
Germany has not yet accustomed, is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country remains costing play a greater role.
If see the euro crisis, for example, each time positions itself as Germany mega-player, unlash certain feelings antialemanes.
This is not easy for Germans.
Is a old problem nobody wants be surrounded the countries enemies.
Seen this way, Germany uniquely much more difficult United States.
Must show receptive the different views neighbours and and this not easy.
The influence of US in European policy diminishes increasingly, but the EU not moment covers this vacuum, who is then?
Germans not left to take a role stronger.
Even if dislike, if it is unpleasant or if makes them a people even more unpopular, c'est the vie!
Stephen Szabo is Director of the Transatlantic Academy Washington, a institution academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analysed jointly the challenges facing the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also member of Germany Marshall Fund, where specialises German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
'Protection of trappings': when Puma and Armani immediately become Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known globally and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this behalf hides a designation officially registered China but has nothing to originals.
However, this enjoys protection while the real epónimos not submit a demand.
And even then is not clear they will to reason.
'A foreigners find it increasingly difficult protect their brand China ", points Thomas Pattloch, lawyer the practice Taylor Wessing specialist violations of rights Far.
Each week reaches my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple letters to register their brands.
Of this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and rather than Prada is records Prada-Kny.
German companies also copy legally similarly, as happened to manufacturer Puma sports.
Pattloch opens drawers which is seats the office brand Beijing.
The 14 September 2010 a Chinese company marking asked register Zegna DF Puma, a behalf artificial also of using home fashionable Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are world champions this copying and violating the IPRs is well-known.
On cities plants there major warehouses several execution-only sale of counterfeiting.
However, cases of Pattloch are other. For their customers, he combating the Trademarks Bureau give officially Chinese firms the right to benefit of a denomination is already recorded elsewhere.
The Chinese call 'Bang Ming Pai' or marks companion.
The floor originates on the term Chinese 'Bang Dakuan',
Reference women who have 'fish' to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities not feel guilty
'is damaging to the business, must combat this', requires Pattloch.
'The marks makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage which the image is enormous.'
Financial losses and coasts procedural sectors affected billions are, especially the goods emblematic of luxury.
According to the company CLSA market analysis, with a volume 15bn per year China is,, the third market and the luxury goods fastest-growing.
However, achieve cancelling inscriptions of dubious legality records brands is complicated and furthermore supposed much money.
Can processes prolong until nine years and the result uncertain.
Pattloch speaks cases where court dismissed a because had spent demand both the behalf aim demand already became a 'reality of market'.
'If the complainant has unlucky, perhaps even pay money the plagiador because the process has damaged marking this China', indicates Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the free-for-all.
Some cases best-known relate to elements graphs.
2009 Daimler-Benz lost a case against the manufacturer machinery construction Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by the manufacturer German concrete bombs Putzmeister.
Therefore today Chinese cannot continue using a emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, used initially a logo blank and Blue recalled greatly BMW; the issue dirimió on courts and Geely had.
The manufacturer clothing Lacoste lost China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented crocodile a looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities not feel guilty.
The Trademarks Bureau CTMO Beijing recognises than 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, 'the situation labour emergency again normality'.
Of this way, the amount processes complaint without processing has cut 22%.
Almost 57 of these resolved resolved, 75% more the previous year.
However, 81.500 complaints continue pending.
Fight this costs money
Typically China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO recorded more 1.4 million protection applications trademark, almost one-third rather than 2010.
Be a new record and means China leading by tenth time the list of new inscriptions worldwide, according to the trademarks bureau.
Think this is the number of same valid, figure amounting to 5.5 billion.
2011 would nicked by 1,800 billion yuan of rights.
, which means of average each registration costs 1.28 yuan or 160 euros.
Combat this costs money, as shows the company German family Freudenberg.
For more seven-year the group waging Court a copier Chinese.
While Germans have achieved halt the illicit manufacture of spare car imitation
The copier has achieved rights ensure the Chinese on the mark Freudenberg.
'We ourselves caused this situation because Germany surnames are not protected', indicates Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO Freudenberg Chemical Specialities on Munich.
The Trademarks Bureau CTMO also dismissed the use of the muniqueses.
The two following behest I the Freudenberg, but the part contrary remains fighting today.
Must bear tremendous care
Now the case reached the doors the Court High, where remains outstanding.
Wentzler is confident power resolve favourably the issue and praises professionalism of the courts.
However, also states' the procedure is extremely expensive, both terms of money as time '.
Is difficult to estimate internal costs archive; the business has had to review dossiers of until hundred years old to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the part contrary a 'sum of six numbers euros' with REACH a amicable agreement, but failed.
'This demonstrates how much we matters Wentzler', points.
The dangers on Far threaten even with affect Europe,
Specifically if the imitators ensure there the rights on brands not protected.
A Chinese manufacturer tried registering Germany Freudenberg the behalf for shoes and skins.
Long ago the group abandoned this field commercial, however achieved prevent the.
'have great care', States Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies which are extremely careful of doing business with China.
Not enough trust international law on mark rights, but is' also China whatever susceptible of protection ', as indicated Wentzler.
Otherwise, the issue can be more expensive than a simple register.
Of, where lose last round Freudenberg of their battle particular, then to pay the part contrary rights of licence by their own behalf, as explained Wentzler.
This or the segment involved expulsarían US market.
Day combating AIDS: sing, help dance,
On Heidelberg is trying the chorus Imbongi and Swaziland welcome orphans AIDS
History a link able of overcome 8.733 much more kilometres.
First we begin by dancing: boots cowboy slippers basketball, shoes seeking tacón and mocasines the on soil of parquet, and are quickly.
A, two, three, four.
Only then begin to raised slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, low tenor and soprano), arremolinándose, entorpeciéndose and siguiéndose each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the director 29-year-old threat with get almost their boxes for the order with its gestures vigorous and gentle.
Is Monday evening and room music Institute Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song.
Also reached fifty singers, of 23 and 69, from the human genetista until master of home.
'Om' Obani 'is not a part easy, each voice the choir has a different text and also foreign language barely known: the zulú, a language spoke elevenfold million, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Assistance self-help
According to a estimate of UNAIDS, United Nations programme to combating AIDS, worldwide exist approximately 34 million people with HIV.
23.5 million them live on the South Africa.
On Swaziland there are 245.000 AIDS orphans.
More 40% of the population is already positive.
Partnership voices for Africa has encountered Germany godparents for the 180 orphans AIDS people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
By 15 or 20 per month can be endorse a child.
This contribution cover the plate uniform school, the and I ensure hot food the day Gogo Center.
Imbongi means zulú 'narrador stories' or 'panegirista'.
This room nobody knows speaking fluently this language Bantu, but sing yes know.
For ten years this chorus is trying songs on this gentle foreign language at times achieves carry them to their: southern Africa.
To 8.733 kilometres straight line from Heidelberg northeastern the realms of Swaziland, there is a people so-called Esitjeni depends of voices this chorus German.
40% is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still simple shacks mud-plastered Straw, a large part of them are children.
More 300 already have no parents because have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example affects Swaziland: the rate of AIDS infection higher living and hopes lower worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population struggled with circumcision, which as demonstrated half contagion risk.
More 40% of Swaziland carry the virus immunodeficiency, and die with more thirty-year-olds has become commonplace.
En-route whole Africa on spring 2005 the chorus discovered this recóndita population, but what saw above all many children streets which lacked not only the protection of their parents, but of what: food, clothing and training.
Without title, possibilities school a poor country are slim.
Initially was only the particular commitment few what was a child to college and enjoy a hot food the day. All this to few euros.
However, a year after the chorus founded the partnership 'voices for Africa' since has addressed professionally of orphans AIDS Esitjeni.
Facts on infections sexually-transmitted
What are the main sexually-transmitted diseases?
Between the ETS of origin bacterial are the syphilis, chlamydia and the gonorrea.
The ETS of origin virus more usual are AIDS, the virus papilloma, the genital herpes or hepatitis.
The ladillas and the Sarna are between the ETS water-borne parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
The syphilis and the gonorrea occur more frequently men have sex with others men.
The Institute Robert Koch part that at least four five cases of syphilis registered Germany originate contact between men. Sexual
For adults heterosexual sexually-transmitted diseases more usual are infections chlamydia, tricomonas, the virus papilloma, the candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrea.
Contagion HIV among adults heterosexual the country is relatively low; however, around 20% of new HIV infections on this group.
Between the young, infections chlamydia are much more usual other population groups.
European surveys, three quarters of all infections young affect 15-25 years.
Our country virus papilloma also adds to diseases more between the youth.
How evolved number of infections?
Not all sexually-transmitted diseases are subject to declaration compulsory.
According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections syphilis doubled their figure of 2001 3.698 to 1.697 cases where 2011.
The number of new HIV infections remains downward trend since 2007.
2011 occurred approximately 2,700 cases.
Is one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate is a disease venérea?
Infectious diseases can ulcers genital area, inconvenience the orinar, flow, pain abdominal and tablets or verrugas.
Often not cause pain or cause others symptoms and therefore not detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce contagion risk, but not provide protection the.
Some pathogens of sexually-transmitted diseases also can be transmitted through infections dirt and contact.
For this reason, experts recommend be regularly examinations doctors, especially if changes frequently of partnership sexual.
If early diagnosed of way, most the ETS can healed and is late avoid any result possible.
Through cooperation donations and, last but not least, fees of the chorus for their action throughout Germany, reach collect rather money.
'total have sent already 200,000 EUR Esitjeni', indicates proud Annette Lennartz, chairperson of the association.
The own people Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure herself and with skills leadership administers money sent from Germany.
There are orphans find a good accommodation, for example with a of grandmothers.
The 'gogos', as known women greater zulú, are pillars of people.
Some of them have until 14 orphaned office, offer them a ceiling where live and involved children appear school all the days punctually and dressed with their uniforms.
The lonely are under protecting Khanyisile, a woman unwed, like the two cooks responsible cooking all the days to more 200 children hungry, perceived a wage of partnership.
Also 'voices of Africa' has launched a school of tailoring, has built two barns and, with the organisation healthcare US PSI, achieved that many of of the villagers have subject to proof HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite patent is this disease throughout the country, not usually speaking openly it.
A king with 14 wives
'AIDS is taboo all', States Annette Lennartz, 'because concerns sexuality'.
Something strange a country where King has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This way of lives accepted officially is largely responsible spread quick experienced HIV on recent decades.
But it must also the countless seasonal workers seagoing the country of a another and have where van.
According to Annette Lennartz, 'any corner can be achieved condoms, but these barely free used.
Is another culture, here only accept contact skin against skin '.
For promoting exchange cultural, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years by the South Africa singing songs of melancholy, pugnacity, hope and confidence black, songs many the southernmost still recall Africa of apartheid.
A bus full White chanting songs single-language recognition black; not only a excellent Environment brings and joy, but has also achieved wrenching a couple of tears some other border soldier rabid.
The journey has always to Esitjeni, where singers visiting children apadrinados.
Despite this small population barely appear maps, River Valley is very known Ezulweni.
'Acércate to Esitjeni, there shines the light', the people.
And after the 8.733 kilometres straight line back to Heidelberg until rooms street test Bergheimer singers marking the step riddled, one realises also possible see shine their light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice Mercury
The probe Messenger has found proof of ice Mercury.
Probably the ice has a thickness of until 20 metres.
NASA, the Agency US space, evidence of ice Mercury.
Despite be the planet closest the sun, water helada, three studies published the Thursday the magazine specialised 'Science'.
The probe Messenger have found evidence the area of the world permanently to the shadow has formed a ice.
Think this has the less 30 centimeters and probably even 20 metres thick.
Water is presumably of comets or, with great probability, asteroids which collided against Mercury.
Nobody likens the finding ice with the possibility of lives in the planet, says the researcher head of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Temperature Mercury can to achieve 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help clarify how have come water and others components of life elsewhere solar system.

Our window the universe: the major telescope
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey on 1608, before Galileo Galilei the use year after a to observe the stars.
Since then, rear-view of the telescope optical has not stopped of grow and images we offer increasingly depth.
For 30 years, namely 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale on the Centre pigeons close St Diego was the the world.
Its mirror, image, had a diameter five metres.
On Arizona, US., the Large was closed Binocular Telescope.
This detect the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The Great telescope Canaries on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter 10.4 metres.
The mirror Southern African Large Telescope on South Africa is segmented to cost savings.
Despite this, achieved diameter of approximately eleven metres.
The drawback this construction cheaper is the telescope has a angle fixed levitation, so its mobility is limited.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly on Texas also has a angle levitation fixed.
Its particularity is their huge capacity to collect light.
Despite having a diameter mirror comparatively smaller, this capacity equals the telescope mirror larger of world.

Researchers assume the pole South Mercury must also ice.
However, no evidence proven, since the probe Messenger revolves around planet into a orbit much closer the pole North.
For decades measurements of radar point to the existence of ice on Mercury.

The tour of the mountain area of Talysh could be savage and romantic.
The moves minibus great commotion through sinuosa road hills to hand, rivers of wealth wooded and the simple houses of the local farmers.
All is green and juicy, one could even think the Black Forest.
However, we are the most southern Azerbaijan; here the border with Iran is only a kilometres.
Here live 'talyshi', a people of not know much, dominate perfectly Persian and the Azeri and are very ageing.
Our destination is Lerik.
This small city boasts a architecture perhaps too maciza designed the Soviet-era and is fit within a landscape mountainous so scenic.
European tourists are hardly this, since the way from the capital Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To go the 323 km separating both cities, need eight-hour because road is.
The staggering wealth enjoys the country through oil Caspian has not yet reached this recóndita region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has be to become a tourist attraction.
'Baku became famous in May with the conclusion Festival Eurovision and next year hold Festival of people more elderly world' Fatulayeva, points.
Is the headmistress Museum longevity, perhaps the only the world.
Here is documented the lives eight dozens of talyshis the have overcome 100. Fatulayeva a image black-and-white.
This is my grandfather, lived 120 years.
A son own died to the age of 136 years
However, the star indisputable of museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, no starting birth what certify.
And considering the man greater age documented lived 122 years, the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
'born in the region 1805 when and died in 1973', explains Fatulayeva.
Man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently still had time devise a daughter more to the age of 136 years.
Has wrong then Şirali Müslümov its age a couple decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo on the Institute Max Planck Society Rostock, has also heard of the elderly this inhabitant Central Asia.
'In some regions China, Japan Valley or Hunza Pakistan also live elderly very advanced', States Scholz, 'even Sardinia many older men'.
Because lack of documentation, is impossible provide scientific evidence on age, especially when there no civil register.
All the days glasses full butter derretida
Is which, surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants area around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
Today 20 people over the 100.
Why live here, South, many elderly?
The tour guide Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains is the special genes of the talyshis.
The director museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes in change that the cause is food.
However, from a seem logical nutritionally, not precisely food rich calories of the talyshi, which love meat, bread and mainly dairy and many of the which, furthermore, drink daily a glass butter derretida, so healthy.
Or perhaps the way of natural life which keeps the young people? on Cengemiran, a small settlement not far city Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
Their 97 years is relatively young to what is estila for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which states have 143 descendants, lives in a simple home timber typical all the Caucasus.
Sitting on soil, moves tirelessly a huge VAT of butter.
Eight people live under a ceiling, between them one of children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
Also brincan around two toddlers.
In the kitchen preparing tea guests, tea which serve in few glasses typical with way abombada.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and perfectly aligned and under the headscarf hides two long trenzas of hair dark their child we discovers proud.
Always I laundering the hair never milk therefore I has fallen and has maintained colour.
'Nor I never used a shampoo', States Mirzayeva.
The pension is sufficient to live
Of has always eaten only what produced on its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
Throughout my life not I been never shopping to a supermarket.
Then told husband, army.
Worst was the times post-WWII.
Yet again track when the 'dear father', Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
Such propaganda sounds rare from a woman greater.
However, Azerbaijan the cult to professes the contained paternal of the nation, which is country as a dictator, not bounds.
This remained power until 2003, when surrendered the baton to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly of Azerbaijan not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva is 230 manat (roughly the same amount) of monthly pension, to live well given the situation here.
And perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva is right: 'Our culture the greater well-respected'.
Live a major family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this was not sufficient reason e-Toll with lives years...
The Constitution lack the expression 'Rights'
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations vying each other on the Cairo highlight the tremendous division currently facing the country.
The future Constitution, with Sharia as basis, is very controversial.
Egyptian President indulge in Pathos.
'we must overcome the transition.
And happen is my responsibility to the people and to God ', stated on public television.
Its addressed speech all the people, especially Copts Christians, Liberals, Muslims illustrated and the secular.
All mired without remedy until now a confusing opposition, have fear.
Fear a theocracy to shores Nile by the grace the powerful Muslim community.
As explained Mohammed Mursi, almost asking forgiveness, had to annul the powers temporarily the Constitutional Court and extend theirs' to save the revolution '.
However, or Egyptians nor the world know very well what this engineer 61 with a PhD given University Southern California to really save.
Does deprive of their power the judiciary?
The 234 articles, which has been forced by a constituent assembly comprising 100 Members predominantly Islamist an evening sitting 15 hours, are really worrying.
As on previous constitutions, draft also the case-law is' principles of Islamic law '.
However, what this means of 'principles'?
This was and remains open to the interpretation and appear Islamists will take this vague wording and the legal leeway included, to impose stricter interpretation Sharia.
This is less what suggests a new Article added: on all issues relating to the Sharia is compulsory consult the University Al-Ashar, the institution Islamic more important the country with great power around Islamism Sunni.
Not has why be, but this cannot mean clergy monitor the legislation, which - indeed - would result incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much the draft open to interpretation Constitution is
What is also problematic is to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition.
After the fell of the dictator until 11 civilians were detainees on prisons military.
As establishes the draft, the state protecting 'the real substance family Egyptian' and 'promoting moral and its values'.
The formulation is an so vague in legal terms that with the assistance Article state institutions could even control the content film and literature.
Talking clear is not is censure.
Incidentally no Article establishing explicitly equality.
On other prohibits change offend or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.
However, unclear what is a offence and how has of be sanctioned.
As dubious is the formulation prohibits the 'affront people'
Is sufficient caricature of President or a joke on a counsel?
Issue of interpretation, as many other things draft submitted to Mursi for signature and according to, their words, 'very soon' be submitted Egyptians to be under referendum.
'Revolution has'
Weeks the opposition is closing ranks to the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered a unusual harmony the Fridays Tahrir Square of Cario and swore themselves outplay Minutes before can enter into force.
'The revolution has returned and we overcoming', States Hamdin Sabbahi, third lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and exdirector of the IAEA, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft Constitution should be 'dustbin history'.
Through Twitter accused followers of Mursi to lead a 'coup against democracy'.
'When convene the referendum will his palace and derrocaremos', says the opponent Jasser Said.
'Even are not tired, blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada', was quoted media Egyptians the political opposition Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not wanted monitor the referendum, for what not consider valid.
'The Koran is our constitution'
The Muslim community well-organised appealed for a contramanifestación; lest not Tahrir Square, but after a prayer across Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters Salafis took part in the cry: 'the people requires law enforcement divine'.
Required to Mursi 'cleanse the country', while proclaimed: 'the Koran is our constitution'.
A fight for sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where began all, had led to a situation like civil war.
Clearly supporters of Mursi not wanted risk something happen.
The Muslim Brothers said both the oppose the draft Constitution as supporters of same have expressed their views loud and clear.
Should now is time let the people decide in the polls what direction should follow the country.
Here, the draft Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
'The expression' Rights' even says'
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced which really should have lasted until February and including all social forces.
This lawyer 48 years specialised human rights and President of the Egyptian Organisation of Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when were retained imprisoned or were face a trial for the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Not because nuclear-plant their ideology, but because to the Rights are indivisible.
For this reason beaten, condemned and imprisoned.
'and now the expression' Rights' not even appear in the Constitution ', regrets a conversation with the Welt am Sonntag.
Enlargement powers Mursi the three powers lawyer the made this State resign itself.
Adopted measures are gross violations of the rules democratic and lead to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
'Instead of strengthen civil society, the Chairman is abolishing', regrets Saeda.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organisations.
Saeda feel abandoned, also by the international community, which looking idealogisation taking place to shores Nile with a mix curious and tension.
This could rebound on them.
A protestor Tahrir Square warns: 'you conceiving a monster not telling controlling'.
The rakfisk Norwegian: fish more stinks the world?
The five million of Norway enjoy one higher levels of life, not only of Europe but of the world.
Can the success of the country relates with its for a fish extremely stinks?
Take a number of cheeses excessively cured.
Colóquelos amid a mountain of dirty football and wet.
Let him a week.
Can then smelling the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, a of the exquisiteces of Norway.
I am small city Fagernes of, three hours Oslo.
Is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and the smell ever-present fleet air.
The rakfisk is trout delicious Dutch herrings that water leaves making wine during, depending on the stinks you prefers, until a year.
As obscures and is making colder, the Norwegians flocking to a festival held here, Fagernes, devoted to this delicacy most,, mesmerizing.
'crude eats and then drink a glass of aquavit a pill, "says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known as the' General of the Rakfisk ', responsible organising the festival.
By all directions people eating this fish is small buckets and drinking a pill important amounts drink.
'A some people like more the aquavit the rakfisk', States Havard.
Drink can kill smell.
Pruebo some pieces.
If you avoid this close nose, is not evil; not very different to a share of sushi has come few kilometres bus.
The is a product rakfisk from a time very different, poverty sweeping Norway and, before cooling, the fish is bore during the fall submerged water and salt casks caissons.
Later, full winter when is already fermented well, are taken and, obviously with the ways inactive owing alcohol, eats.
Only a generation, thousands of Norwegians obliged to leave their country for work, and mainly emigrated United States.
Currently, the population is rapidly increasing; more 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance jobs, high a comprehensive system wages and social services.
A stream inhabitants Sweden, old rival and until a not too much more rich Norway reaches this country to work.
The rakfisk is something important, a essential part, if rather stinks, last of Norway.
Is between the dishes more expensive to be bought.
But, fact, all is expensive. Cane beer or a sandwich you costs whopping 10 €($14) each.
Norway not often appear in the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like.
Here people is still unwilling to the behalf Anders Breivik, the racist of far-right acribilló and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, relate to shooting as' the event of 22 July '.
To the Norwegians costs enormously believe which placid country one of theirs could commit such cruelty and homicide.
After much current wealth Norway is growth, since the early 70, a industries oil and largest gas of world.
'but oil is not the only reason we is so good', States Anna, our camarera, while goes on on-board rakfisk and, with its long melena blonde and their surprising blue-eyed, is the image prosperity Norwegian.
'are, as say you, people prudent ".
Its English, like the majority of people at this country, is impeccable.
'not we like boast, we dislike ostentation'.
Norway has managed its oil wealth careful; all, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is spent on a special fund benefit of future generations.
While everyone was dissipating money not had during the years preceding the financial crisis worldwide, Norway maintained wallet well closed.
'As can skiing winter and do rambling summer, are happy, "says Anna.
'and eat rakfisk', adds with a casual laugh.
I snow queuing to eat something; I have already had sufficient rakfisk.
Now a hormone-enriched elk is certainly something different and quite provide irresistible which savour.
But evening becomes this stinks fish.
The hotel I host is one of the many local welcomes a dinner of rakfisk where diners vote the better fish, or perhaps more tested the graves nasales.
Television has connected live with a presenter carried bow tie and is surrounded of dishes of rakfisk.
Seems the competition Contest.
'what are your scores to the better fish up there on the mountains, Thor-Juergen?'
'Here is our punctuation, Havard.'
Is laughter and applause.
A man fall chair, perhaps outplayed by aquavit.
Or perhaps the vapour all this fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard beginning
While President incoming Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new President and differing expectations of its population.
Traffic City currently Mexico is particularly bad.

The aim, however, was not prevent workers could reach their workplace, but prevent demonstrators could arrive to Parliament.
The Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, receive presidential band and will the management of the nation.

Mexico has gone gaining good economic results outgoing during the government Felipe Calderón, but the country is involved in a war against narcotráfco which has already killed a 60,000 lives in six years.
'My government has the great commitment with the Mexican people reducing violence', explained Nieto Mr Peña earlier this week the President US Barack Obama, Oval Office.

Before pace with US President, experience prior policy Mr Peña was as Governor of their state home the of Mexico.
A state populous and with rapid growth, surrounding the capital; The views on the new leader divided on this territory in the he used to move.
A man sincere
The bucolic city Bravo Valley, for example reminds with affection.
Its residents attributed the merit growth of tourism on place and infrastructure.
To reach the town can lead by a of new roads of Mr Peña Nieto, huge improvement compared with roads agrietadas and full bumpy were rehabilitated.
Can also be see plates with its behalf the entry polideportivo a modern and a impressive museum climate change interactive.
'We it achieve a real change long-lasting and', says friend and political ally Gabriel party Olvera Hernández, Member Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
'particularly regard to safety and economy hope the interesting and real change that our country badly needs'.
After a period uninterrupted 81 years, the PRI was unseated by Vicente Fox in 2000.

Also rejects the rating opposition of lack of essence of the new President.
'a man very honest, very committed and a excellent vision the country.
Is a fantastic man, and above all, is a person listener. '
However, across the state that is not the impression has many people on its former Governor.
On Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valley bravo could not be higher.
Under tranches high hidden motorway is many ways, a suburb of the own Mexico City.
And the problems of municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year asked speech the military to help combating gangs drug operate within the neighbourhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
Desert proportion, placed alongside a landfill of rubbish, have been left in just the last two years bodies dozens of women murdered.
More of 1,000 women were murdered the state Mexico while Mr Peña Nieto was Governor a far higher rate than Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famously violence and a place stands manslaughter of women innocent.
The critics of Mr Peña Nieto say, at best, which failed address the problem of feminicide while office.
The critics accuse its administration blink.

'had signs of had been hit and rigour death' had already emerged '.
While its mother substance history, a photograph of Mariana have since the walls, together to a cross which a only word: justice.
However, exactly the family says denied.
Authorities' State Treaty I have as old chismosa, a disruptive, a quejica.
What want is one simply accept what they say and street '.
'But this cannot be when have there such irregularities and such negligence', States.
The presidential band President Peña Nieto will Saturday will a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands families affected by crimes violent Mexico for the last six years and the new President has promised give priority during its mandate.
'I hope the same President which was when was governor, "says the Member PRI Olvera on Valley bravo.
However, this is what families of victims of Ciudad Neza more fear.

My identity crisis mexicano-estadounidense
States which many forced to leave Mexico because the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticise the were; says recall Mexicans of those times difficult
Navarrette said the mexicano-estadounidenses trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely was down by the Dome and reached the area of discussion immigration and was already totally unclear.
A indicated posters towards two queues: a to 'Mexican' and another to 'Foreign'.
I was there seconds without be sure where should go.
Having grown Central California, all my life I drew Mexican ''.
Is taquigrafía ethnic, similarly my friends Boston relate to themselves as' Irish 'or my friends New York define themselves' Italian.
Later I decided to 'mexicano-estadounidense'.
But this was Mexico.
And, homeland of my grandfather, the taquigrafía or the hyphens were not needed.
Was simply American.
Speaking Spaniard. Sufficiently well to manejarme during a interview this language.
But have not the level of vocabulary a and cannot native because of my accent American.
So took my US passport and I made the queue of foreigners.
Thought in this week where President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda, as always meeting leaders consisted these two countries,: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was forward speak also the growth of the economy Mexican, a of the reasons why currently Mexican a is so likely to is Mexico as venture to go to the United States.
To partnership with United States and Canada and creating in America a trade bloc the EU style.
Furthermore, Peña Nieto promised continue fighting cartels drugs Mexico, although not gave details.
For Mexico, the relation to the United States is complicated and grudge.
US probably most remember never in 1848 the US invaded Mexico and forced its leaders cede half of its territory gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think centuries, not Minutes, the elements remembers are everywhere.
So, when the a United States official say anything involving the slightest criticism Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both the press as between the Mexican elite, on how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And children of Moctezuma rose of war.
And yet, for Mexico the relationship really is a challenge is the with the more 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living the United States.
Are of rancor?
Much.
Mexico winners and losers, persons to the country provides opportunities and other for which is not.
The only reason we people living cities Mexican descent as LA, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is, somewhere our family tree, person, the parent or any of grandparents was closed door opportunity Mexico and had to leave northwards.
And most the times anyone fit into a profile certain: dark-skinned, a level of studies low, from a people poor etc.
We are their top-down and I loyal.
Mexico not.
And, despite perhaps we experiencing now the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good work, cannot lose never that what are experiencing is, the American dream, and not Mexican the.
Is possible sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is.
Is for the United States.
Moreover, aware many of Mexicans belonging the elite class leader gustamos not.
The feeling is mutual.
See us as a reminder a humiliating defeat and we look above shoulder as if we a inferior not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
To their view, our existence is failure.
If our families had not failed Mexico, not gone.
And now we would not trapped after this smokescreen gloves, living well to the United States but, still, as souls solitary.
My woman, born in Guadalajara and wine legally the United States when was a girl, I recalls is this friction between the Mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know with more solidity who are and the seconds this resent.
Although citizen of the United States, it feels part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel not part of none of the two.
Love Mexican The hear the group Northern Tigers, but also Bruce Springsteen.
Have the best of each country, but you are not rooted to them.
Mexico see us as Americans.
And the United States we believes Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things, for what I learned during my trip some leaders Mexicans and intellectuals want reconnect to the diaspora.
Want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as' ambassadors' of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests the United States.
We say to our colleagues US fantastic which is visit this country and presionaríamos leaders politicians to strengthened ties with Mexico.
Yes, clear...
This will not happen.
Is too rancor.
And, with inequality wages, corruption rampant and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure fantastic is a country.
I fear you you will be alone with this idea friends.
Is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States way treated a century ago and environment Mexico, then must accept the fact some mexicano-estadounidenses are still resented how treated less relatives long time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps be more 'Mexicans' what thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a basis unlikely for peace
Can have someday lasting peace between Arabs and Jews Middle East?
Another bloodshed which seem to any hope is vain.
Amid the pointless and usual discussions on who began first, piles buildings left in rubble; 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis murdered and, first, missiles from Gaza have fallen close Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city Jerusalem.
But, despite Israelis and Palestinians appear anchored to their former conflict, all to Middle East is changing.
Spring has left Arab all shattered like or not, Palestinians and Israelis stranded the regional fuss.
Perhaps this make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, its lethal impasse could desencallarse.
A war which or loses or wins
To first view, optimism currently looks very difficult to justify.
Even if maintained ceasefire agreed 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened hawks sides.
Leaders Hamas, the Islamist movement which has governed Gaza since 2007, will say have obliged Israelis to withdraw despite Gaza has received a good whacking.
And despite having killed some of its leaders got pressure and the 1.7 million Gazans one corners grimmest and villages of planet, Israel has not solve Hamas.
Of fact, Hamas is gaining ground West Bank, the other part Palestine currently governed by its hard-hitting rival Fatah, the Palestinian faction more moderate.
Furthermore, leaders Hamas may conclude time plays its favour.
Given Islamists have gone gaining influence for all the Arab world, Hamas has fact rich friendships and powerful.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power which previously the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has embraced the cause Hamas. Also Qatar, States more rich Gulf and dynamic.
The Member exhilarating Hamas say the Islamist Crescent collects Israel, from Lebanon north, where dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels a trend increasingly Islamist could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where allies Hamas are threatening the king.
Especially the South Israel, growth of the Brothers military-led Muslim the President Muhammad Morsi Egypt, with difference the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance region.
Hosni Mubarak, despot secular government Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, not had too time to Hamas.
Instead, the Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their more leaders popular opinion.
On future action diplomatic, Hamas emerges as protagonist the cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing Israel will conclusion opposite.
On the military question, have put Hamas.
The anti-missile system Iron leadership of Israel has proved effective and many missile Hamas have been destroyed.
Israelis dormirán more confident... for some time.
Regarding diplomacy, United States is firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas of initiating the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered. Especially under the government Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister has ignored widely the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed a 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier dissolves West Bank, the main hunk of a territory would-be become state Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements which are increasing even though, under international law, are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud has joined a group line even more hard Iranian-led Avigdor Lieberman the run-up to elections the 22 January, is good position.
Why coddling these clever Palestinians giving them own state?
If really ruled by, not dispararían rockets as have compatriots Gaza?
Is better taken after this wall and to a good blow if rose head.
Perhaps prevail hard wing, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Although Islamists to take power and elsewhere Egypt not have much appreciate Israel, its priority will address the internal difficulties.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than the its four Arab neighbours together.
Start a war with the superpower area hardly help new governments Arab improve their economies.
The pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire augurs well and could usher.
Also Israelis should think long term.
With elsewhere Arab becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians its right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox a day will explode at Israeli-occupied territories, this week exploded a bus Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy on the state Jewish and demography worsens the situation as the population Arabic.
The harsh missions on Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas pay diplomatic a toll growing.
Both sides need a nudge of outsiders the conflict.
The solution touting people remains sensible sides, most of the world foreign and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory Israel for safety reasons.
Hope, small short-term the ceasefire give a little more impetus outsiders struggling.
Egypt, must start stop arms entering Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on borders 1967, with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared.
Arabs unrelated to the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This more the creation of a state Palestinian the imminent seeking a category of State virtual the UN.
Mr Obama is also a important role in regard to achieve Israel to the table.
During his first mandate omitted present its own peace plan.
The White House, seems as reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision.
A Middle East stable is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a agreement Israel-Palestine peace.

Australia has banned Internet advertising companies and local websites, but cannot restrict on pages foreign.
'If comercializas tobacco and just you is this window to promote your products, the area is the most convincing the be', said Becky Freeman, researcher public health the University of Sydney.

A world connected, is not badly aburrirse a little
Over the yuletide of day Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had five p.m. in an airport because the plane where volábamos suffered a problem mechanical and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had for consider boredom.
Not I lying.
Spending half-day a airport waiting for a flight is rather dull, even if you have means to be entertaining, as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But ever more academics and development experts childhood praise the blessings of boredom.
According to them, is well, we and our children, we aburramos.
Aburrirse obliges the brain to find options interesting and can promoting creativity.
Since, currently, most we are connected to this or the screen, not experienced the benefits boredom.
So should accept mood boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But, discuss it later.
Firstly, like many people, involved that, now have more time for leisure, boredom be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as states Peter Toohey, Professor history Greek and Roman University Calgary, Canada, and author book Boredom ': lively History' ('The boredom, a history animated') published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
'De fact, history of boredom is very extensive', States.
Walls of Pompeii exist spraying of graffiti Latin on boredom from century R AD
We must also consider how define boredom.
'the problem is is already earmarked and discussed very ways Eastwood', indicates John D., Professor of Psychology of the University of York Ontario Canada.
After examination investigations published and raise the idea before a group of discussion formed per 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of 'wish, but, participate in a activity you full'.
Says the gap between the boredom and apathy is person doing something but want to.
Points which with apathy there is the wish do something.
Experience of boredom, States, is' upsetting the process of attention, associated a low mood and a sense that time is slowly '.
Boredom may sound dreadfully like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says may be, people boring tend to see the problem as a issue of environment world or, those consider the problem depressed have.
Sometimes think we bored, when what happens is actually we problems for concentrate.
Its study Defining: 'The Unengaged mind Boredom on terms of attention', published the September the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and their colleagues deferred to a experiment previous the involved listening a thriller a person reading Article a magazine.
Some groups listened room adjoining a television programme to all volume bore no relationship, others listened with the volume under, they hardly was perceptible, while the third group audio not heard the.
The Group listened the programme with volume showed more under boredom the other two groups; I cost concentrating, but not were certain why and attributed the boredom.
'When you try to concentrarte a task difficult or interesting altering attention can lead to boredom', indicated Mark J. Fenske, Professor University neuroscience Guelph, Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
'For other hand, when you are doing something boring, as detect parts defective towards manufacture, a music you distract you can help aburrirte not'.
'currently De fact, know to move or, action garabatos often interpret as sign boredom, may actually help combatted, already that make this person is physically more alert'.
"show those children allowed move learn more and have more information those obliges them to be sitters', says the Professor Fenske.
We all aburrirse sometime: late plane, a speaker monotonous, a film especially boring.
But some people have more tendency to aburrirse other.
To help measure, some researchers extraneous the 1980s a 'scale of trend the boredom'.
The scale includes issues such as' many of the things I have are repetitive and monotonous' and 'there is so much interest me not have time of do everything'.
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology University West Florida,, using those scales, researchers have found boys have more tendency to aburrirse more often than girls, and specifically need more stimulation external and more varied.
But generally adolescents are a kind group weary rather easily.
1991, Reed Larson, Development Professor human and Community University of Illinois, carried out a experiment which represented contact with 400 adolescents and his parents between seven and eight times daily through a seeks.
Discovered the 32% of adolescents said to aburría while school or making duties, while 23% said to aburría when was not school.
Furthermore, 3% of parents had they bored.
Professor Larson said not knew if percentages boredom current, 21 years after, would lower superiors or.
But said what knew was' adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its higher inexpertly ', largely because both children as adolescents are not given a great control over what want do.
So, turning to my question of principle: is good aburrirse?
Sometimes it is not, since, led to extreme, could make we expose physical risks absurd, as do bets and fall consumption substances as method to combat it, as demonstrate investigations.
Furthermore, many philosophers and writers speak the connection between the boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, which has State studying this matter for more two decades.
'The boredom is the brain of say to should be doing else, "says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology of New York University.
But the brain not always know what more appropriate.
If you are boring and you this energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, this you will.
But if are television, you satisfies short term, but long term.
'So, if your son is boring and I a iPad, already aburra not, but no learned to dilly-dally itself or to dosificarse', States Professor Fenske.
And 'this capacity of dosificarse applies to other situations',.
Your son not only learns to dilly-dally alone, but learns to be better controlled elsewhere.
Not really want praise the boredom.
But should not be too critical with him.
Our objective should be, rather the be comfortable paragraphs of persistent rumour activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
'A our view, need tiresome more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing as to link with something worth', States.
Points out what people really search is a way of disconnect and enjoy a time-out.
'In a environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados', states, 'is difficult find ways of focus stops when noise'.
Colorado: without instruction to the new law on consumption marijuana
Anthony Orozco, student 19-year-old a Community Institute and footballer of south-east Colorado, faces a criminal process for something which legal around the been: the possession of stones marijuana and pipe using fumarla for.
Orozco a September day, him and some friends lead Lamar, on the plains close to the border Kansas, when the deflected the police.
The police found marijuana the car and a time after Orozco received Silopi judicial for drug possession and articles relating (misdemeanours involved fined each USD 100) the reported the date.
'We as criminals, "says Orozco.
And?
Uncertainty weeks following the vote held at Colorado for legalization of the possession of small quantities marijuana to use recreational, response hundreds of causes minors for depends less possession of drugs of the law of location.
Hundreds of misdemeanours for marijuana possession are cancelling both here and the status Washington, where approved similar.
Departments have left police presenting charges against the greater 21 for possession to small-scale, be adopted legally once the law has entered into force weeks.
But the prosecutors of districts more conservative Colorado have committed to proceed with cases open for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
The same time, several cities Denver suburbs, from the to the mountains Western, are voting for prevent open shops marijuana, authorised recently, their communities.
Everything this is changing so quickly not know what will next ', said Daniel J. Oates, police chief theater in Aurora, just this of Denver.
The distributors rules in the state Washington are also dwelling the issue.
And still seeking advice for a system licences production, manufacturing, distribution and sale; this before the deadline, 1 December 2013.
Say, right or wrong, Colorado is ahead of most states on regulation of marijuana, first purposes and now to recreational use terapeúticos.
'Colorado has a market more regulated, so be a good guide', States Brian E. Smith, spokesman Control Committee alcohol the state Washington.
But Mr Smith admits anywhere or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
'not a real precedent we serve model', States.
The law of Washington, so-called I-502, enters force the 6 December, leaving also one-year which between two water nadará, as the system in the state licences still not exist, but the possession will legal.
Furthermore, some sensitive matters mechanical must resolved during this period, as the way a balance between the state of offer a 'proper access' marijuana authorised and prohibiting business of cannabis at a radio lower 300 metres schools, parks, areas play childish or child-related.
'In no place more difficult locate a business cannabis allowed to urban areas especially metropolitan Seattle, "says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for cannabis legal, a research group created recently.
The 21 November, Oates leader Aurora police, sent an e-mail their players police which I reported the tax would city prosecute by lacking minor for marijuana possession to elderly 21 and the police would presenting charges against these crimes' with immediate effect '.
The police chief Oates said they milieu of enforcement of the city regulating the cultivation marijuana therapeutically and continue persecute traffickers and sellers drugs.
County Weld, northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, is a stricter vision.
After the vote, assured his office continue pursuing cases of possession marijuana, mainly to bear consumers and to treatment.
Currently 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, although many of them have others charges.
'Our office must prosecute those misdeeds when were occurred crime', said Mr Buck a statement.
The response was complicated even places as the County rural Bureau, where voters rejected the initiative on legalizing marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the greatest city county, already indict adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, fiscal district of Worcestershire supported this decision, but also decided not dismiss none of cases for possession.
'not I is losing time the continue fulfil the law until this change', said.
Despite 55% of voters supported the measure, never considered take marijuana use to use recreational within the government outside and the system judicial be easy.
Reactions contradictory raised by all the state reveal a marked ambivalence between officials environmentalist about the large experiment this state.
'is a barrier cultural with prosecutors district', States Sean McAllister, a lawyer Denver representing defendants for marijuana possession and is spokesman local National Organisation for Reform of law on marijuana.
'Han past both time taking people to courts, actually still cannot accept that legal', said.
The be the first States which regard the small amounts marijuana of the same way if outside alcohol, Colorado and Washington preparing to become test cases to national level regarding legalising drugs.
While lawyers and state officials new border have a sales legal, also are looking forward federal government receive indications, still provides for the consideration of the sale and marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of legalising the marijuana hope the Department justice give in.
Despite been some highlighted arrests of patients and sellers marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government enabled mostly are business of sale marijuana with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 States more.
'Although is likely players anti-drug not act doors down to confiscate a bag of drugs small, probably will allow the operation shops regulated by the state marijuana for selling to use recreational, allowed in new law', said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor of anti-drug policy administration Obama.
Several cities Colorado not expect to act federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any food-selling new marijuana, despite will around year before any can open.
The week, the city Western Montrose adopted a ban six months and likely adopted next week.
'not want get a situation allow someone and then have a serious problem federal', explained Bob Nicholson, Member Municipality.
'Our Community voted against this amendment.
Are looking for what voted the Community to vote for what voted the state. '
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: 'I harassed to down Oxford by be a Tory'
Not attacking the for their views university only now
I no moment in my lives in not has state dreaming to achieve a on Oxford University.
My father as my brother more I had state supposed was the best the world to learn, a symposium Greek promoting contemporary was the two pillars civilisation: the free thinking and tolerance.
However, the two weeks occupy my on the Worcester College to the late 1980s for lodging the race history, had already suitcases, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and was cry.
My friends were bemused.
The Evening Standard said I had left brooked no because some fellow university maintained sexual relations in the room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced kidding I had gone because I obliged drunk to rates desconchadas.
The truth was less fun.
Huí there.
Yes, huí, because had been under a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because to my extravagant behalf, or the fact to come of a private school.
I harassed by a only reason, the cradle of alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a highlighted adviser Margaret Thatcher and I supported the party conservative.
Perhaps ask what is this now.
Well, several reports suggest a new cohort center-right is suffering a persecution similar.
Hatred institutionalised and growing towards students party conservative this is Oxford the week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights have homosexuals, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Members conservative JCR (grouping students of) of corpus Christi College claim which are 'often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treaties undesirables' for their ideas policies.
Want Committee create on the equal opportunities university your college to ensure able to express their views freely.
Their situation not was favoured by a recent documentary the BBC2 so-called 'Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right' (The paradise: young, brilliant and right-wing) on students and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Showed the graduate student Joe Cooke, ex-President party Partnership of Conservative Oxford University (OUCA), a Rolls-Royce, donning a suit silver and a stick with the empuñadura of silver.
At other universities, students Conservatives say they is as' scapegoats' by introducing rates higher plate.
Luke Black, 20 years and Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party partnership University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper 'there is a growing trend left universities.
People assumes we as the Bullingdon Club without even know '.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and student on corpus Christi presented the motion for greater protection, says this environment uncomfortable is' 'while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and leader OUCA elected the, says the attitude Members JCR towards people are center-right has worsened.
'This threatens the environment intellectual debate and to the welfare of Members', States.
During my first weeks at Oxford was more alone that the a.
Entered university in September 1986, a young of 18 terribly timid.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was peak.
The previous year, the university had voted deny Thatcher, former pupil, 'Honorary' following cuts financing the Higher Education.
The had fact environment shudder of horror to any Stalinist.
For the early days week university welcome the new, when the new students know and known lecturers, received the bitterness I expected.
I found the professors not only the eyes to the gagging contained University of the conservatives but involved in it willingly.
Policy strike miners, privatisation and government opposition to penalties apartheid South Africa reached rooms timber of seminar.
The first I be translate to English texts French eighteenth and I was not prepared to what followed.
'Miss Wyatt', said Professor Harry Pitt (already died), 'please translates the first paragraph'.
Not di not a.
Pitt, a man bajito with a face seemed mass of bizcocho, knew well how expel bad gall.
'is the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is are simply fools?', asked.
The others university laughed out.
I were burning the eyes of tears which was contain.
'Le suggest that will French classes on free time always and when is not too occupied knowing people', gruñó Pitt.
I returned my room soul into as a worth.
The evening sat single to the dinner at university; then was a slight tapping back.
A student English second year so-called James presented as Member of the OUCA.
'I know who you are', I said kindly.
'I fear as is the thing.
Go with whatever suspected Tory.
For me is very complicated, but know your father is close Margaret Thatcher, so thee worse.
Many Tories newcomers appear Labour be '.
Later a local pub I cowardly conceal.
Insisted not was agree with everything said Mrs Thatcher.
This trick proved pointless.
A student Policy Philosophy, and Economy, paradoxically, had studied Eton, said: 'Eres daughter of a pig fascist.
You are contaminated '.
Others students adopted this ditty.
I became the dirty perverted.
'how have relations sexual the Tories?', asked one.
'give thrashed each other?'
I was of the same way which should have sense homosexuals before the law liberal the 1960s.
Could someday normal life at Oxford?
I obliged to be with people thinking as I only after the dusk?
Would to Labour and repress my natural trends?
The three years I expected presented as purgatory-like ostracism and isolation.
The only Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History intended to my college university.
I they hated by not only be of the Conservative Party but also Thatcher adviser foreign-policy and a of people I wrote their speeches.
Was only by there.
Hated the place the regarded parochial and insignificant and grip to the vision marxista-determinista of history.
On 1997 accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
'Here not you be happy', I said.
Started travel daily Oxford home of my parents London, finding refuge my relatives and friends of mentality more open metropolitan.
I said to my father hated Oxford and why.
Not I believed.
When he studied there the 1940s, accepted all the views politicians.
'but if is the better place of world', said with sadness.
'never They would this, not there between my ladies needles dream.
To my friends Communists always had a attitude impeccable '.
Their pain eyes began to nublarse.
'Dale another opportunity.
I sure trifled have only for.
I partiría the heart dejaras if. '
Exhausted many trips to London, my resistance emotional was deteriorating.
A friend, also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced their creed.
The following week, during a seminar which another professor history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, which I was' a enemy of people ', I.
Red shame inside admití my parents I had 'brainwashed' and I called 'old stupid'.
The truce short-lived time.
Was my father who the last nail in the coffin of my university at Oxford.
Then my father wrote weekly two-pillar press of Murdoch.
My door was closed locked.
I was within huddling of fear and, past five minutes, my persecutors duly repented.
When were asked suitcase and took the first train to London.
Never I returned.
Perhaps I llaméis weak llorona.
But none 18-year-old should under such a level of intimidation and hostility a institution educational.
Even more tragic is was Oxford, has trained 14 Conservative Party primeministers but, today, behind a reputation nothing deserved equal freedom of thought. And

Takes three hours each beaten and just, but allow pool 138 000 rupees (11.5) the end of the day.
Although appear peanuts to inhumane effort, is triple what would field.
'The Jornal of miners is very high here, where harvesting coffee paid 15 rupees (1.2) the day and the average monthly is two million rupees (167)', clarifies the porteador, which earlier worked as bricklayer the tourist island Bali.
There, their salary was 75 rupees (6.2) the day and the coalface was not as hard Anto has, but his family to Banyuwangi, a suburb the volcano, for a reason weight, Indonesia, is forthright as sulphur: 'I casé with a young Bali, where Hindus, and I brought Java to turn Islam'.

Singapore seeking save the economy babies for
The singapurenses blame the race, stress and the cost properties and education for not bear children.
'The population Singapore need grow'.
Am a husband patriotic, you are my wife patriotic, fulfil our duty civic and believe lives!
May appear implausible these be part verses an announcement pills Mint, but despite this - or perhaps because this - the video became viral on YouTube Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part rap a using references local and 'we put a Bao (roll) oven' for laugh birth rate of Singapore.
The company video, the advertising BBH, hopes for the announcement achieve draw attention to the problem playful manner.
Its director creative, Douglas Hamilton, says wanted to use power of music for people fulfil 'its national duty'.
This is something purely Internet, so we had to amusing and funny.
Is the greater problem in this country.
Are the worst world reproducirnos ourselves, so are this was a issue which we address.
Knew the government to many things, as launch perfumes with feromonas or organise veiled quick citations (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas can have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we think, why not do the more creative effort to resolve this problem, which is compose a rap?
1.2 children
Not taken so lightly is government Singapore.
Spent $1.3 the policies year to encourage citizens have more children.
A government package to marriages and parents attaches until $15,000 per child, extends maternity and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city high-tech rich and State south-eastern Asia, also known for conservatism their leaders and their stringent controls social.
The birth-rate of Singapore, agree with its division national population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last was above 2 - known as rate of reposición- was 1976.
So why the singapurenses not have more children?
So Wei Ming, director Policy marriage and Family of Division National Population, says is' better education 'and' a wider range of career opportunities'.
'That has given the people have a wider range of options in terms objectives of life and priorities, beyond marry and a family', explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to increasing soltería, and delay marriage and births, resulting fall birth rate Singapore.
Meanwhile, a immigration policy should tip to increase drastically immigration to confront the population decline has created resentment between the local population.
Singapore is websites where abounds xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, criticising for maintaining low wages and not integrate.
Increasing immigration is also seen as a reason why the last year the party Singapore government experienced its worst result election since independence.
Since the elections an attempt of correct the problem quotas and higher charges for workers foreigners.
Consequences unexpected
While the fall birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax income healthcare costs and policies immigration, the example Singapore is also having some consequences unexpected.
The government tries to not build houses small. Many
For example, has begun affect estate.
The authority urban development has past to control the number of flats small, known as' shoebox 'can build in certain areas of the city.
These flats have areas of 46 square metres and have had great success sales.
However, there is concern of could promote a lifestyle of soltería and discourage developers to build family large houses,.
But Lim Yew Soon CEO the company property EL Developers, says their boxes of shoes' sold much faster units.
Are more popular, sense units is deplete days, even weeks, faster units greater size.
This makes it much better for our flow.
However, admits the new rules clearer guidelines for give developers, previously they put obstacles if wanted offer too small units a project.
Too stressed-out
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the birth-rate national speak with the singapurenses working on the financial district appear centre not will have much effect.
"people is very stressed, houses are expensive and also education, many people are postponing," says a young executive.
Other people can bear children.
'But is important to me have my own money and time, "says another young around 20 years.
Men and women mention career, stress and the cost properties and education as the reasons prevent them bear children.
For much the government treats of push their citizens to bear children, making babies, the singapurenses are those last word.
Private take-off line is private on-line
Privacy.
Agree with the English Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy the quality of private or 'the field privacy is right to protect any intrusion'.
What is private to lower 16-year-old?
How applies this definition into their lives everyday and social networks?
Does dangers is exposed by ventilate Internet situations surely share offline?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys of ten 15-year and, users frequent of the network.
Four cases, associated the term 'something very own', personally, and 'the key and behalf of user', when applied to social networks.
'My secrets deeper not the rise a post, "says Jorge, ten years, when tries to explain the meaning of private sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where has for two years.
'secret are very secrets, my Mum can them, but not everyone', States.
On Belgian francs subo images fine or games.
I also entretengo with my known.
'not could photo than mine, or someone making ridiculous, "says.
The Child recognises is badly publish photographs obscene, people naked, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures the 35 friends in Belgian francs and their nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is including, has the key a of accounts.
Opened Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting.
'not if I answered, I only the subo', adds.
'are social networks entertaining, I speak with distant relatives or with my friends swiftly',.
Not doubt answer that would never accept a request a known person.
Or would case someone I recommend to a strange.
The case of José, 14-year-old, is different.
The teenager has accounts open Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, at this late admits not know 20 people aggregated on its list of friends.
'not I frightens, because have common, music for example',.
According to the kid, none has hinted or asked direction of home or telephone number.
'If I pressure or I demanded simply the sack of my account', recognises.
José was follower of Ask, after reading recommendation on Twitter.
The boy not are alien the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
To a well-known a my friend gouged were a social networks.
The threatened and asked money.
'Never knew who was', assures.
The victim, according to José, not closed.
'Only put privacy'.
Then explained steps to shape the mind safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy might photos of known situations inconvenient or embarrassing.
It would, if I fall bad or I.
'Although I know this is ciberbullying', States.
Key questions
Marielos cudgels, masterpiece English and a graduate on Education and, believes Learning to orient children and adolescents must be understood the purpose of social networks is inform.
'Internet emerged as a means to find information, but with the aparecimiento sites changed the rules mentions.',
Truncheons the academic Marc Prensky, masters on pedagogy by Yale and author the work native-born and Migrant Taskforce, coined these terms explain phenomenon.
Digital natives they, children and young born with technology.
'We are digital immigrants we must teach them, when still are learning, "says.
Said the issue is complex, 'because are asking a criterion defined on what should or not disseminate, publish or say to a age maturity not to this'.
'also are selective when what more matters is be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences adds',.
According to the specialist, the most effective way of teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through reflection questions to.
'say not is', adds.
Then truncheons lists some options: not I contarías to a strange, why Internet bundles?
Or, you would publish photo thee as a friend publicaste?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When labels photos of party pediste, permission to the others to them?
And a more all need to know what you each time?
Another point is signalling must act on-line as do off.
Are the same rules.
'One outside Internet acting with respect, morality and other principles, as must be social networks', States.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guard, Professor University Professor primary and education consultant, said must parents policies read to conscience social networks.
The understand each stages them have solid foundations to converse with their children on the implications opening an account online.

Deaths per AIDS today are cause of late detection
Mr Fabrizio was 21 when confirmed the result of proof: AIDS positive.
'was as if I fall bombing', concerned the the moment announcement, the doctor to do 'more suavecito', without success evident.
The kid hid it his family.
Decided take just its disease and began to inform on it; with such efforts festejó already birthday 43.
Is undoubtedly one of patients oldest HIV Unity Civil Hospital Guadalajara (HCG), reached in 1994 after several battles.
Mr Fabrizio live with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, difficult imagine the early 90, when had many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, until director of a clinic of IMSS avoided goodbye it 'because cut brought a'.
Then, bear AIDS was synonym.
Now is possible survive this syndrome and do with quality of life.
However, ignorant its disease, still many people arrive when the virus has already raged, 'exhausted' its system immune and are victims of opportunistic infections.
To 31-year-old the AIDS worldwide, at least the first cases reported, 'the great achievement means currently sobrevida the a patient initiates treatment timely and the sobrevida of the general population exactly', indicated chief HIV Unit HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after refer this information was authenticates April this year at a publication scientific prestigiada.
Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented since 2008, scientists had concluded AIDS was not a ruling fatal, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of allocation the system immune presenting patients the open diagnosis, with best expectation for those are not drug users: of until 30 with a tally 200 CD4 and 50, when entail 500 CD4.
Simply, means whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive the 25, under these terms' while maintaining control can live without problems until 75 ', explained interviewed. The
To dimensionar this progress, recall expectancy lives Mexicans today is of 76 on average.
While mortality has down substantially the past, Mexico, the number people dying of AIDS was 6,678 cases where 2007 to 4,862 2011 (annual report UNAIDS), since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients the database national died.
Only on Jalisco 255 people died 2011, and 187 deaths until May this year; however is to universal access to the anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
 - why still deaths?
 - A I think the problem is not access treatment.
So visualizo, we happened our hospital.
The least the last 12 years have not had desabasto medicine the problem is patients because known arrive very advanced status infection, or stages late disease.
Gave a fact forceful: '9 of ten patients arrive when already have opportunistic some infection has to to have greater impact on global mortality, is make diagnoses earliest and therefore must offer screening massively, all people require'.
Proposal coincide specialists and Council officials Prevention State AIDS on Jalisco (Coesida) also the own patients, as Mr Fabrizio, who went to be proof laboratory to a reasoned particular, only because had fact a friend and, despite its young, was already in stage AIDS and even part sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous growth is a of the complications common.
Everything changes when know you have AIDS.
Some think are to die and not truck.
'If I die, better I reviento three times the week,' say not my case.
The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, take medicines.
To date, their parents only know which endured cancer.
Alive a lives normal, as anyone.
'Labour, I many activities, I, I have a sex lives active, but guilty, I am cautious me and the else', listed Mr Fabrizio, who accepted share privacy with Goals Jalisco to motivate with its testimony who today, under the World AIDS Day have fear.
To proof, if had risk, which between soon know if are HIV positive, is better and if are already diagnosis, learning which can live as anyone, be responsible.
This, your message, summarises the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
Large gaps between the health programmes and the citizen common, argued Ricardo Salazar, journalist tapatío who has assumed cause around HIV.
And the largest is prevention.
Where devoted to this task 'has increased the distribution of condoms, before giving us one or two, now we give packages of to hundred, and this is very well but we who today, yet have access to a condom', said.
Between the more vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
'what the quieres?' is question common scorn and value judgments social workers school guiding,, employees pharmacies and health, not want State adolescents, assured the communicator.
Proposed this ineffective distribution reorient; condoms are not only after the counters and those 100 are bathing despachadores public sites frequent the young.
Is not motivate the promiscuity.
Or pay chelas the and the motel, as responded Governor Emilio González, the ask if have distribution condoms on administration.
'this is not sexuality, better is bring condoms to those already practise a sexual activity' pointed out.
Key In Jalisco

The state 4 ° place is national new cases and accumulated AIDS and 13th.
92% of the infection the sexually, 6% to the route blood and 2% to the route perinatal.
Estimated 50 thousand people can be living with HIV as for a case recorded is 4 to 5 people not know.

Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes: 'basketball was my'
Globetrotters of basketball Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes was more 60 linked sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, travelled the world.
Few persons Puerto Rico has a collection mental history local basketball broad as is Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.
And is before a stroke the confining to a wheelchair the 2008, Reyes was immersed sport by more 60, were as major-league categories minors, player, already National Higher Basketball and leader BSN the with the cowboy Bayamón or President Federation Basketball.
'I I many hats the basketball through my life, including several to the same time, as when was chairman BSN, CEO of National Team and President federating during the 1990s', reminded Reyes during a visit of First Hour home to Bayamón, where lies with Isabel, its faithful wife by over-50s.
'The basketball was my.'
Kings not exaggerates to this assertion.
The walls of home, almost all decoradas with photos and memorabilias which denote its extensive trajectory,.
The heart Bayamón
Of all, which enshrines with greater emotion are the are reminiscent its step jeans since the 1950s as player until 1982, when fulfilled 15 years serving as coapoderado or already franchise.
'facing were my better years, the I enjoyed because I opportunity to be part eight championships jeans since 1967, were already coapoderado or leader stranglehold, as.
Were many years of gratifications, including the five championships deprived since 1971 until 1975.
And I despedí with each 1981, the year of debut Jerome Mincy the BSN.
Thereafter took over 'cuco' Ortiz, which was a great administrator ', indicated Reyes.
Remember Gene Bartow, which had addressed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I said: "I a player well strong, 6 '7' stature.
Do quieres? '
And this was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players that has had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our better marksmen.
I said if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse help bring other.
The championship jeans with Gausse it benefitted, but already distance, for 1988 already supremo was of federating.
To this time preferred enjoy their records Mincy and the National Team.
Remember when I won first United States during the Preolímpico Mexico 1989.
Then wine the World 1990, where fourth and should have been bronze not be by the referee Canadian made us repeat the final move second time, said Reyes.
Should this group World of 1990 is the better National Team to see that you are seen?
Is between the best, like which I won the Dream Team on the Olympics 2004.
But my favorite was the Panamericanos on Cuba 1991, when won gold and gave a pela the team United States, which was quite similar we won bronze worldwide.
The team not only was to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) 'Toñito' Columbus and James Carter young, the Brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, was unable to be 90 because a injury knee.
A team perhaps not was the better terms staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Preolímpico of 1995 Neuquén, Argentina.
With players Canito as' 'role Nevis, Paul Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended for the mess the Panamericano of Sea Plata, won gold against all odds.
What has been the better major-league Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers to level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody on Puerto Rico has dominated to this level as Piculín.
And this without its trajectory the different played leagues.
Who was the better leader boricua?
This is very difficult.
We had a boat good includes Julio Toro, Lotus Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like much the work Leo Arill.
What you look at your biggest success Federation? the
Have been part era more glorious of National Team in 1988-95 and the early 90 the BSN had to 17 equipment a season.
What you was do?
Was things have, as implement regionalisation of categories minors.
For example, than boys of Ponce only play in its area and only face equipment of other corners of the Isle the national playoffs.
Now same children travel and play unnecessarily. Too
The least the result of certificates compulsorias and way to leaders official, and table referees.
This I pleased.
What you now?
Most I is listen music, see videos of music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme my grandchildren and occasionally go to play basketball.
And clear, enjoy the my wife, Isabel, which always me.
Dies the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born the 21 September 1931, Forth Worth (Texas), was globally famous for central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as' J.R '., television series' Dallas', embodied to a businessman unscrupulous malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, the role predatory as the tycoon J.R. Ewing the television 'Dallas' became a symbol of greed the 1980s, died.
Had 81 years.
Hagman, which returned this year as J.R. a new season 'Dallas', died Friday evening due to complications of cancer, agree with a communication family provided The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., House packaging-producing 'Dallas'.
'Larry was back its beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the role iconic more liked to', said the family.
The family of Larry and its closest friends were with him Dallas to the holiday Day Thanksgiving.
Borders Gray, which interpreted the role of its wife the number original and the sequel, was with Hagman when died hospital Dallas, said the publicist it, Jeffrey Lane.
I carried joy to all which knew.
Was creative, generous, amusing, funny affectionate and talented, and extrañaré.
'Age a original person and lived the lives maximise', said Gray a communiqué.
To Hagman diagnosed with have cirrhosis on 1992 and acknowledged that had drunk much for years.
On 1995 I found a malignant tumour liver and had a transplant.
Years before 'Dallas', Hagman is notoriety television as a kind decent the comedy slight 'I Dream of Jeannie' by NBC 1965 to 1970.
It one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another Captain Tony Nelson, a whose lives astronaut is disrupted when is a attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and is live with it home.
Was protagonist also two one were little time the air, 'The Good Life' (NBC, 1971-1972) and 'Here We Go Again' (ABC, 1973).
Its work cinema contained roles welcomed by the criticism 'The Group', 'Harry and Fool and' Primary Colors'.
But was their masterly interpretation of encantadoramente detestable J.R. which led Hagman to its full estrellato.
The number dramatic chain CBS on the clan Ewing and others characters in orbit was the air April 1978 to May 1991.
The phrase promotional 'Who shot J.R.?', intended to generate expectation on a episode full emotions the character Hagman almost is murdered, generated speculation international and million dollars risky houses betting.
Also helped to give the number a record hearing at the time.
When it revealed the answer in a chapter November 1980, a average 41 million viewers the sintonizaron and made 'Dallas' the second programme entertainment more seen of history, behind the end of 'Mash' 1983, which took 50 million spectators.
Was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) whom I soared.
J.R. the embarazó and then the threatened with characterise it of prostitute unless outside the town, but other also had reasons to attack.
Hagman interpreted to Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a smile charismatic: a company cardsharper and a husband infidel which tried to his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), outside internada.
'I know what I the tombstone of J.R'., said Hagman 1988.
