Interest rates have in Hong Kong the same level as in the US. 
According to the first minister Australian Kevin Rudd, the legislators should quickly resume the negotiations and adopt the proposal for supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, we would risk that other countries suffering the consequences. 
The blood of American actions 
On Monday, the House of Representatives American rejected the draft endorses the financial system, which it should have put up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 bilions of Kč). 
The renièrent legislators and the call for support for the project of President George Bush. 
After Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the economy. 
American actions' era, on Monday, a blood bath and the main indices of actions experienced the largest fall in the 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, a decline of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress gave: the government of the US can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush came to an agreement on a broader form of financial aid to the US financial system. 
It will be put to the vote early next week. 
American legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to the tune of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion kronor), in the US financial system. 
The success is not so sure. 
Indeed, to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must finish a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan of the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee of banking regulation and financial of the House. 
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should have been put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first psychological factor for the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanism by which the markets may be effective, a "disappointment". 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
We have solved our opinions on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilise the market, "assigned to the Agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
It said the final vote could be done by Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday, representatives of legislators rencontrèrent the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form. 
It should buy, financial companies, the unsaleable property assets which drive financial companies in losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and which must be effective, too, on the market. 
It still need to continue this recovery plan of the markets, but I think that we have, "said Paulson. 
A signal to the trade Asian 
The global financial crisis has impacted the falling asset markets. 
According to Senator Democrat évadiez Harry Reid, legislators are so that Congress could reach a final agreement by Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could impact on Monday. 
For now, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two chambers of Congress comes out the vote, or if the negotiations do not remain blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem. 
Legislators expect it will be adopted in the days to come. 
However, the law will still many changes. 
The total amount devoted to aid the system must be split into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as the wanted President George Bush, must be available as soon as possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not complete its office, he has the opportunity to block the remaining amount, in two stages: first extra $100 billion additional, and then, finally, $350 billion dollars. 
Mr Bush salua progress in the negotiations 
Although the President can vetoing this decision, Congress, has the opportunity to put it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the thrust of the programme, which was to obtain finance for the buyout of bad mortgage securities, whose value fell by, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to Sunday to vote on the law, and the Senate on Monday, "identified Senator Republican Judd Gregg. 
The US President George Bush himself is pleased with progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with progress made Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Restriction of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement of relief, the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also provides to limit so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and named a committee, which will hold the surveillance of the funds. 
This should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and we have made good progress towards an agreement which work and it will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for the property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advance in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the instalments of debtors and enabling them to keep their homes. 
Marek: A psychological assistance 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the plan is a good idea, but this will be very difficult. 
And that is because we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of buying assets from problems. 
This will be to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week in the server iHNed. Cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according Marek, not that serious. 
It is much more important than the congressmans to agree; this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological importance of the agreement, the approval of the plan, the most important at the moment, "stressed Marek. 
A fight taken to the extreme: MP3 players against mobile. 
You will, how to choose 
While virtually all mobile can read of files MP3, not MP3 player knows telephone. 
It seems in clearly that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
But there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader. 
The choice of how to use and demands of future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house a gramophone expensive high-end to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, to such music products do not leave on chloride, and, from the point of view of the quality, there is no real reason, for that to happen. 
If there is in your shelves disks vinyles crowded, with the art rock, jazz or blues, you hope at least likely of such a gramophone. 
Same is true of music for the movements to the music high-pressure, to the point of simplified music in the MP3. 
There is also some categories on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kronor for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be to sustain headphones bought for twenty kronor to the market. 
Two extremes, from which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
The life span of batteries is also decisive 
Some readers of music are capable of much more than of a simple reading of music, but it is of unknown, of course, most of the mobile. 
No current apparatus is also universal that the telephone. 
Has the primary functions, the phone calls and texting, it is able to read music and films, registering them, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, to serve. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and the communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that no stocked knows burn of meat and no television will take photographs, almost to a miracle. 
However, the universal mobile is not without problems. 
The more functions that you use is, the time between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And the reading of the music is one of the goinfres of energy the most important. 
Are rare mobile who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this is substantially less. 
Here, readers of music (especially the rudest) are much more efficient. 
In the case of the mobile market, trust that they will play music for a few hours. 
Moreover, if you call from time to time, procurez-vous, to be sure, a second recharge for the work - this is true even for the more expensive. 
If there should be no problem for MP3 players, which are capable, following a reloading, a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including the less. 
Another problem in the registration of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a limited part of aircraft has a connecteur universal USB, as not all cannot be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
There is, of course, recording music directly on the card memory, but little of card readers know themselves without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memoirs used in mobile phones. 
As far as readers, you need, without exception (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fill, through the connecteur USB, the apparatus of music from the computer. 
Most of the mobile and readers will create a library media classified of after the name of the performer, the title of the album, lifestyle, or maybe after the judgment of the user. 
Some appliances showing that an index with a structure of tree, in the manner of the Explorer, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, phones intelligent with operating system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate, mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of a concrete apparatus, get you to the lifespan of the accumulateur, to the capacity of the memory, to the quality and the type of out of and, of course, to the ease of the order. 
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if the day you will listen for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you should any mobile reading the MP3. 
Virtually all mobile can now. 
You are not even obliged to do too much attention to the sizes of music that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music is going until you will just this format. 
It is part of formats most widespread and hand him, the great majority of appliances can also read music from the format WMA. 
The ACC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less. 
The mobile upmarket also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It is enough to visit, since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) and buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile musical. 
The offer is unfortunately wretched and she is, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly. 
The prices are not lower. 
However, it is generally believed that this way to buy music (either by phone, Internet, or by the wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people still their mobile. 
Every time you want to listen to something, you have to to the mobile of your pocket, but you forgot your MP3 player in the home. 
However, it is also important if you have always on you of headphones or a handsfree with cookies. 
If this is not the case, you can use the Integrated pregnant, that virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their prices. 
The cheaper cost normally less three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand kronor, there can be one walkman already very dignified. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best telephones and better equipped, also a entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand. 
The readers, by contrast, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
Really is to ensure the order readers the rudest - which do not necessarily correspond to cheaper (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarities of the order with a cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet link by chance, followed by a bill of transmission of data. 
Any choose 
Even the mobile the least expensive (by ex. The Vodafone 527) have generally a slot for cards memoirs exchangeable (the M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor. 
But be careful. 
The models of basic support in principle that cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the more expensive fare even with maps memory of 8 GB. 
If you have a mobile and still want to buy a MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 100 kronor. 
If you are part of the auditors more demanding, choose rather mobiles-walkman metalworkers (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices are equipped with hints of independent command for MP3, and that is how the ease of the order is moving closer to that of a MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, the mobile of the series walkman have the same menu user of MP3 players sold separately, is that has gone further in this area. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and a life of the accumulateur (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is covered by an MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks mentioned. 
A first virtual operator will gain the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively high, our operators offering practically the same services that their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, we lack of something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not for a long time. 
We have already mentioned, repeatedly, many times, on Mobil.cz the fact that the operators Czech are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The ČTÚ (The Office Czech Telecommunications), which has said that the price of a SMS was higher here than in the rest of the EU, has confirmed. 
That is, following the latest of the European Commission in the area of regulatory charges of fees roaming, a paradoxical situation could happen - SMS sent from abroad to some customers mobile Czech operators cheaper than the country. 
How is it possible that the price in the Czech Republic are so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a competition that would enter in the fight. 
It may seem paradoxical, given that we have even three mobile networks and penetration which exceeds 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, he Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech of telecommunications (ČTÚ), which has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there were more room for another operator, crowd with the operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network apparently more luck (to date, it would be difficult of frequencies). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which has led to falling prices, to, in the future, also react the traditional operators. 
However, even before the entry of the game such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, similar to those that we mean we first place in Britain. 
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples. 
In February, we informed you launch, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In just six months, this operator has won more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country. 
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns the U: fon in Union-Czech. 
The advantage of virtual operators as the opportunity to focus on a target group more practical. 
To be effective, they need far fewer customers that a classic operator. 
They are, indeed, where costs of construction, operation and has mobile network, relatively high. 
That is how in the world, the virtual operators are as operators to low costs – for calls and text messages, which is often balanced by a range of services. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, of SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland, focusing on a target group unusual can also be a good advertising. 
Indeed, the operator is specifically men. 
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator who and what they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk home. 
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based on most of the virtual operators. 
Especially as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, operators say mobile 
It seems almost sure that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not Mobilking. 
"We are discussing expansion of this project, but assuaged the negotiations are not very promoters. 
The launch of Mobilking will take rather place in other countries in our area, "said in a's telephone for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial group Penta. 
It has indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not to this idea. 
Instead, they are trying to do everything possible to that a potential competitor may appear. 
The group GTS Novera, who could well take a step back to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of customers company, does not hide, long enough, its intention to launch a mobile virtual operator. 
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already conducted negotiations about this possibility on several occasions with all of the operators mobile Czech. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is perhaps promising. 
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, it is a complete silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that it is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment, no matter a complex project and honesty in this area we have contacted, "said Vlastimil Sršeň from the Department of press Telefonika O2, in its statement for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators are also relates to the specificity of Czech market. 
The spokesman of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová says in a rare with the declaration of O2: "We have not registered for the project viable and bilaterally, which could serve as a basis." 
And going on to add: "It is virtually impossible that a virtual operator in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time so limited, we should have now a concrete agreement. " 
Vodafone is rather its attention on the performance of the requests for its own licensing 3G. 
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with virtual operators, and especially in the field of expenses and shared infrastructure. 
This is what we believe, the more input from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area since the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a mobile Internet. " 
The authorities responsible: in phase with the operators 
The approach mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in the competition, would have led to lower prices and therefore their benefit. 
What good is facilitated the advent of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know regarded as enemies fifty-plus. The niggling accompanying the creation of the U: fon witness also. 
The most apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, the creation of the U: fon, was that the the T-Mobile society. 
In information accessible to the public learned of web pages of ČTÚ. 
Today, however, the U: fon is ready serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová has commented on this: "The competition on the mobile market was, moreover, recently increased by the entry of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market in subdue, it is obvious that the entry of a player additional make, and especially its services, to high demands. " 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators that, the indifference of regulators Czech seems disconcerting. 
It is not only the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike in Britain and other developed countries, has not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
But this embraced, faced with this problem, its typical position. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement has been reached for the moment, because the supply of potential originally had was not enough interest in the traditional operators, "said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of external relations department of ÚOHS. 
A declaration does not surprise by representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which should represent the interests of consumers and other also take care, that no-one will take advantage of its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing. 
As Kristián Chalupa adds: "A abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in the price of mobile telephone services." 
However, lobby for an honest market and pressure on prices is apparently not part of the interests of ÚOHS. 
What is shocking is the almost touching concord of three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question, whether it is really a coincidence, is naturally. 
Similarly, a price of petrol strictly equal to all the service stations is surement coincidental and hard struggle of competition. 
The office has not commented on this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it has no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators of dominant position, none has a corresponding responsibility increased his behaviour on the market. 
The necessary tools to the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even regulator of telecommunications, "said in its statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets by the ČTÚ, that telecommunications are, from the point of view of the economic competition, one market. 
None of the Czech operators has of dominant position in this market. 
However, some experts of proposing a different vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it should be, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
That is how it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of the business. 
However, even without recognising this argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, complaints by many interested (including the society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they are in the negotiations with all the operators, similar constraints. 
Place the blame on the ČTÚ is a fairly common in communications, whereby the ÚOHS is washing his hands of the case. 
We have already seen this type of attitude in many similar cases. 
We unfortunately has not succeeded in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted, an enlargement of the powers of ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must very well, but their interests are apparently. 
When nobody watches, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a kind of operators whose virtual, several in the mobile Czech networks, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies issuing their own list of price of mobile telephone services, but these are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of firms occupant of multi-level marketing. 
The mobile telephone services particularisés are thus proposed by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others. 
The lists of prices of these firms are usually only to elected. 
The magic wand is in the fact that the company is the operator of a classic customer company, who commands a large quantity of SIM cards. 
As important customer, it gets tender prices (and other special). 
The problem is that the trading conditions of all the operators mobile Czech prohibit such a resale. 
"If there is what you suggest, it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we look and which could lead to a cessation of the collaboration with the company in question," has responded to our question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
However, it is quite unlikely a echo of such activity has not been able to the leaders of the mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it may be of thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, is against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these firms their can provide benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators real, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these businesses are used by a negligible percentage of customers. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded in their name, so they cannot be fully, to the way ordinary customers of mobile operators. " 
However, it is precisely which should seem strange ČTÚ. 
Moreover, there is another question ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It must be added that ÚOHS has relatively broad for unveil such an activity, and if it does not be explanations of operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions banning. 
When we will not be the most expensive 
As we have already mentioned, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a significant reduction in the price of services. 
However, almost in all countries where appearance of virtual operators, the traditional operators were searching, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these were almost the same - a market too small, or too crowded, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely that, in developed countries, the regulators, who supported not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of customers. 
Both by formal measures by an informal pressure, finally they obtain the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators address this issue in the manner of a hot potato that are disposed of in the order to provide a target. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in the competence is in these cases more profitable. 
But we must not give up so easily. 
If the information of scenes true and a virtual operator will soon, the mobile Czech market resumes perhaps. 
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can only hard to remain impassive face rejection (to discrimination) other interested parties. 
And we may call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Well the four achievements of the new version of the national anthem Czech. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of the Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek didn solemnly the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my home?). 
The anthem has been recorded by the orchestra of National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a swan solo male or female, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version. 
The song is overseen by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed. Cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Stalin-era national Czech as one of the most beautiful anthems. 
As he had already given previously Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for interpretation of the versions solo singers with young voice and representative, who are marked and appreciated. 
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the chorus, have a good walking distance, so that it is well understood the words, they sing simultaneous," he said. 
The national anthem Czech will next year, his 175è anniversary. 
The song Kde domov můj has just for the first time in 1840 will on the planks of Stavovské divadlo (the Theater of) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of savetiers), original Czech Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup. 
It has become popular and people have spontaneously. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath became of course an integral part of the national anthem. 
It demeura one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent. 
How sounds the "new" anthem 
The transport (MHD) Prague will, Wednesday, the chip in their ticket system 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the pragoise Agency Transport) as the date set in the underground, trams and buses the first passengers, which, instead of having a ticket by paper, will be in their back pocket an electronic coupon. 
At this moment, this is accessible for approximately 100,000 people, owners of the smart card Opencard. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (valid it from 1 January 2009) and the to register on their smart card in the points of information and the offices of the Dopravní podnik (the agency Transport), located in the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying the voucher by Internet websites Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people profitèrent of service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the shop online can forget to definitively the tills in the subway stations, where they were until now trampling of impatience in long lines with the aim of obtaining tickets in paper. 
Indeed, they buy their coupon by Internet and we will deliver on their card Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal library). 
"In these points, there is at the disposal of passengers a one-stop shop with a trained staff, which will help them with the Internet and, moreover, will the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný. 
Has libraries, it will be possible to record the electronic coupon on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several underground stations. 
What are these distributors? 
They are red, the machines composter tickets and passengers have perhaps already noted in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Today, the town has five, but by the end of the year, there should be 80," added Opatrný. 
An automaton will monitor the coupon to the driver 
The vending machines which will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the Opencard smart card and the coupon bought earlier will register himself on the map. 
The electronic coupon are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the town. 
Has in suburban trains and buses 300 to 439, used mainly the inhabitants Municipalities of Bohemia Central for access to the capital. 
"In trains to Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport of Prague), supervisors are equipped with card readers, with which they make the temporary validity and zonal of coupon," explained the control of tickets Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid, which sees the transport of Prague.

The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the US 
The Sudeten Germans were in 1945 that Šumava be integrated in the US. 
This is a letter in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The scientific Library of Bohemia southern). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans staring supposedly in the US president with such a desire. 
This is one of a letter preserved in an archive, which is now lodged in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
Germans Český Krumlov praying in the letter the US President for not allowing "šumavská župa" (region of forests of southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler in accordance with the agreement of Munich - went to Czechoslovakia. 
"We understand the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops on the German territory not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "Senior, the fate of the Šumava like to". 
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - in the national Czech of brutality, attitude ruthless, lack of understanding, of oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter calling the American president take in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign country to us, which oppresses and destroyed the minorities and which has done nothing to the victory of Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter. 
The reason why the authors do not sign the letter is the fear of desire for revenge "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president was of the opinion of Germans Šumava, it would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its residents wanted to be part of the US, or live in the US. 
Although the text content in the letter, given current knowledge of the history of the post-war, seem somewhat, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time. 
While the Germans Czech should at least that the question of their expulsion of the Republic will, very few of them are avouaient such a possibility. 
Some promised that the US and Britain would get for the Sudeten a certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed that they would simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous journalist Austrian Gustav Chalupa, born České Budějovice confirms this. 
During the war, it was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries. 
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp of catching the region Holstein, dozens of Germans were the Czech consult for them learn Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, the Czech their would be beneficial," said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was, according to him, that, following the Décrets Beneš, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You do not considering - you pay! 
A campaign emotional Hizballah drivers 
The action road safety the most expensive in the Czech history. 
One way of describing the emotional media campaign emotional only to the launch, on Wednesday, the Department of Transportation. 
The Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers a dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on the television, radio, movies, Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers to fast driving and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before taking up. 
It is especially touching the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrian, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the commercials? 
Especially personal stories will attack the emotions. 
Also shows the slogan "bloody" of the campaign. 
You do not considering - you pay! 
"You not considering" is written in tasks on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You paieras". 
What must be a symbol that can pay the life of a moment of inattention. 
The spots are "haunt" spectators until 2010. 
The Ministry has inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly of images with images of the victims of accidents. 
He believes that this will cause a decline in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and boost against drivers 
"What works with the drivers, this is the system of sugar and boost. 
For them, the sugar is represented by, for example, the winning time, when they smoked a red light. 
The whip, this is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks need to be recalled to drivers, "said Martin Kořán, the psychologist Transport to the hospital Na Homolce. 
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and rather negative advertisements, the psychologist. 
The notices say the danger to drivers, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static billboard which warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers do will see more" signaled Kořán. 
Olmert in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Israeli Ehud Olmert, President of the interim government, have made in favour of the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview published Monday in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to almost all the occupied territories (), if not all," said Olmert. 
"We will keep a percentage of the territory, but we will give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israel), because without it, the peace will not happen," he added. 
He admitted that the possible would include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and does not want tractors and bulldozers him crashing down, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to abandon parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert alluding to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the first minister, it will be necessary to find a solution to the Temple Mount, the sacred places and historical "located inside the old city. 
"Anyone who will want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, "souligna-t-il subsequently. 
Retirement from the Golan Heights 
Olmert said also in favour of the retirement of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, it would require also some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a pension from the Golan Heights," signala-t-il. 
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up for the Golan Heights. 
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to relinquish their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have the supports constant they assign the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "précisa the Prime Minister. 
Issues that arise after the accident: the stewards in the because they are illegal? 
The law ignored; walk in a because long distance is banned 
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of the society Student Agency of Padua, Italy, is the question if the cabin passengers can during the journey in the interior of the coach. 
"If you wanted to respect the law strictly and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on the road," said the spokesman for the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which has killed a hostess of 22 years, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which has found the way to the coach. 
The girl was the unfortunately sat next to the driver, on the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
However, the coach may have an accident, or curb so brusque, also at a time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What is important is if the coach is by virtue of its technical statement technical of squares up or not. 
If this equipment for stock rose is not approved, passengers must remain seated. 
Coaches long distance Student Agency have not standing; that was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura. 
"It is a question that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, "he revealed his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription cares of this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription does not mean either the carrier services. 
The law on road transport is only the term recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity the spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles, estimates, on the contrary, that the law treats sufficiently. 
"Everything depends on if the coach has in its approval the permission to propose seating. 
Everything is here, "he says. 
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are seats and a maximum speed intercity limited, with offshore upright and a higher speed allowed and coaches long distance without place standing with the maximum speed and highest seats equipped with safety belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, expert BESIP (road traffic safety) in security in the transport, does not see the displacement of the stewards on board as a major problem. 
"During a regular movement, there is no risk. The situation can be compared to that of service in the aircraft. 
No, it is not clear when happen turbulence and the hostess of the air can beat your head. " 
"In the case where the coach would have slowed so brusque, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
In the same way as in a city bus or a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal rules, "he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier coach to offer the services of stewards. 
In hiring two hundred. 
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their job as a profession. 
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a profession, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can get their coffee and newspaper at boarding. 
It would reduce the costs, "he says. 
The concern is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in its vehicles, the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines. 
"We have not stewardesses. We oppose since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, "he said, there is a years, Týden. 
An immense tragedy came 
A young hostess for the region of Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian lorry has probably quité the hard shoulder without using clignotant and it blocked the way to the coach. 
The driver of the latter to try to avoid a manoeuvre brusque, but it has been brought by his right side. 
Jančura refuses the two seats reserved for the rest of stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to make these places, they are stuck". 
The company intends to sue the driver of the lorry. 
For compensation for the family of the girl, the agency will not be the judgment of the court, but as far as the financial compensation, it also counting on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A change in the law, which is now being drawn up for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts of the Department of Transportation, could make the movements of cabin on board the coach. 
", it has not resulted in any conclusion on this point. 
Indeed, it does not too to buses, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones at the wheel, "said the expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally at risk the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, specifying that control of the security of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt. 
The words were not in a letter to the Board of the WestLB to employees of the house. 
By a union of entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a "bloc of competence" doubled a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive signal to other concentrations in the sector banks of the Länder. 
That is what it is like when a committee board to demonstrate its ability to take action in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, wounded, always a strong pressure. 
Not only is this the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority of Surveillance of Services Financiers which has, it only recently, made clear to the government of Land Rhenanie of Nord-Westfalie that the time was running out in the search for a solution. 
It is a question for some time now - also from Frankfurt - a relationship of any kind between the bank Deka, which is the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Although the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas has indicated during the presentation of the figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that the Helaba or WestLB. 
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half is borne by the banks and by the coffers of austerity, instructed the steering committee of talks with the WestLB in commercial activities. 
There might act of financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks come to, however, said in the City. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, in later there is talk of consolidation in the sector pension savings. 
In 2003 it was thought for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of sun and the Halbab. 
Nothing is evident from this ternaire mix. 
Barely the plans had they been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse said against any participation of the Hellaba in them. 
Subsequently, the other two houses either does rejoignèrent not. 
The bank gives Palatinate has been linked to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were always new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with banks of Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hellaba, was however argued against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank. 
Regardless of this, the feeling is to be that the various establishments of the public sector is especially urgent. 
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria is, a union of BayernLB with the bank of Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could be first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure to new mergers should increase, possible partners him escape. 
In the south, it would be a junior partner, although it has so far better resisted the crisis that banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The savings and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which owns 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has, however, drawn a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
They remain at the NordLB rigour. 
Such reasoning geo-strategic do reflects that one of the facets. 
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the key question, thanks to what business model viability of banks of Länder should be ensured, had not been previously resolved by the German coffers of savings and transfers. 
Ultimately, a carve-up of the WestLb could take place, carve-up which here is obviously not liked. 
This is what it is in the letter of the board in place: in any case, would be covered a 'solution' for the establishment. 
How all this will be put in the same basket with union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the festival of beer is also known as the weekend of Italian. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies as girlfriend and, therefore, nothing is, he says. 
Behind them, a cask of five litres of beer of the brand Kaiser, is a bearded well built which shows at around 200 visitors to the celebration of beer what sounds deep his incandescent can produce. 
Elena slapping of all Luca, then the embraces. 
Bologna, they have travelled to Verona.

Three buses are reserved for the Italians, in a bus travel brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the park, the South American people already in addition to their flag, they have already celebrated last night. 
And such, explains Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italian. 
Buses belong to Marco, who is wearing a long coat doubled of fake fur and glasses for the broader pairs silver eels. 
For five years, they go to the celebration of beer, already three mandator this year alone. 
They are night, remain at the festival, and returning at 10.30 p.m.. 
Spend the night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the pot of welcome with a beer Kaiser, brewed in accordance with the law of Bavarian purity, insurance and a group speaking German - Marco has done a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already the bus driving in on the Autostrada direction' Brennero '. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travellers sleep. 
This is better, they will still need their forces. 
Breaks in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other bus with numberplates number-plates Italian are once again a pause before Munich, on the motorway 8. 
When the early morning, the group of Marco finally coming to six hours thirty as planned on the garage near the place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses across Europe are already here. 
Elena, Luca and the others together, Marco is one last speech, explains the plan of attack. 
Firstly: put the small yellow hat. 
It is written to left 'Festival of beer ", Gothic, and alongside the web address of the travel agency of Marco' conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: 'When the doors of the tent of beer is, there is', shouts Marco in the morning. 
"Courir! 'Courir and push the seats at the bottom of the attempts. 
"Not before, otherwise it is, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, it should be distributed in the room! ' 
The mug, shouts Marco, 8.25. 
And do not forget the ordinance! 
"Montrer to the security agents that we behave! 
As soon as you leave your seats, they are parties! ' 
Thirdly: 'This evening, having come here has ten and a half hours pile!' Compris? 
And it is, it is party to the celebration of beer. 
On the road, someone would enter yellow hats to trees to return to the way, the signs and even an election poster of a Bavarian great People's Party. 
It wants to be ready for the return. 
This is the second weekend of the festival of beer, known as the "weekend of Italian. 
There are no precise figures; we talk about 50,000 who route through the Alps and collapse in the newsstand, 10 percent of visitors would come other Italy this weekend. 
The police Munich-style is strengthened by seven police Tyrol South, by rescue Italian volunteers who support the Red Cross Bavarian is a statistical on countries where the Italian occupies first place in the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (approximately 80) with almost 200 medical interventions. 
That is particularly welcome Italian, this is the attempts of the brewery Hofbräu. 
Nights of sleep to shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the federal Finance Minister just a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that it glissait that the sector banker German would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
It is indeed took place this weekend. 
The financial house Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX, is a consortium of German banks credit of a billion to protect itself from turbulence in the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are issued to a sum of 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction at what it is right. 
The money comes from private banks that banks of public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa which bear the losses. 
The financial state was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed the money - which is no longer possible for of distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the liquidity reserve of the bank had been reduced from 95% to 2.37 million, the rate of capital was also slightly declined 1.6 to 1,45 percent. 
The profits and those net from financial transactions were, compared to the same period last year, at ground zero, the income from the allocation of debts and securities determined as well as the termination of provisions in the operations of credit had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros. 
And it was only thanks to the important benefits the reimbursement costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the payment of interest in the pound tax procedures and commercial purchases for companies to Konzern that the deficit of gains of around 16 percent is moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state of all evil speculated on industrial estate, which then had been filialisés to the bank Aareal. 
Because the funding of classic was not quite profitable, Depfa then had committed more closely in the infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects in common between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diverse internationally. 
On the value of société-fille, the Hypo Real Estate has to make repayments which should have on the calculation of gains and losses of a material essential that remains unclear. 
The fact is that the dividends have been cut. 
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of the Depfa, an investor and highly important infrastructure. 
It is more solid than other institutes the refinancing dependent on the market inter-bancaire since it has no submission of customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has once again become significantly enough, with banks lost their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 Milliards EUR - of the appropriations by Depfa of a medium short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding the group is covered with the credit in the medium term, and the company protected the influence of international financial markets largely out of work. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be guaranteed through the funds until the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the Board of HRE Georg Funke explained that the group Hypo Real Estate should be confined to the financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and the political federal for the Supervision of Services Financiers (Bafin) on the principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is now. 
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have to hope. 
However, given the dynamic and impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not inconceivable that it will not be used in its breadth. 
But the opposite either cannot be ruled out. 
After the fact that the bank, according to the latest releases, close to the insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue the less provisional will not reassure people either. 
The stock price has fallen by 75 percent to 3,30 euros. 
The obligations, however, are particularly well. 
While the debts at have barely budged, loans from second warehouses. 
The worst affected are the investment funds for the former société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those of course which have a shelf life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed before a placement of speculation alternative, now their value should be seen as dependent on the stability of the system banker international after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who has led the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
As the institutes, the governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or will that nobody would hope – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months. 
But the noise renouvellés of a partial nationalisation, the likelihood that approached the safety is now a mere hope based. 
This should reserve of the nights of sleep before creditors long-term on the decision of whether they have to part of their commitments. 
The short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line for a postponement of losses for the next few years on the next tax on the income of the capital stock market gains automatically deducted. 
Sylvana and the secrets of sounding to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must stand for the first day at the Highschool of Tachibana, girls begin to giggle laugh: the German is so "kawaii '! 
What has it means? 
Sylvana forever censors already this word thanks to Mangas - in his new Log of exchanges, she speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of Japan. 
That involves I was excitée. 
Already leading the way to go to school I fear. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I find the road alone, fortunately I am not lost. 
The beginning of the past does not appear to be as strict as home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils are one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours least 20, a round table discussion begins with the teacher, the "home extend". 
But before that starts, it was to me to come. 
I am not the sort to love speaking to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils. 
As I had not yet the uniforms of the school, I have an old jupe of my mother, and a shirt, socks ascendant blue and leather shoes. 
In this place, I arrived at the rostrum, and tried to pronounce properly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana... - I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At this time, I was very happy to have started to learn the language there two years ago. 
The 31 girls of the class have all been whispering, pouffé of laugh and signs, and I repeatedly heard the word "Kawaii". 
I already knew from my mangas. 
It is the vocabulary is essential to the survival of ados Japanese and means "beautiful, cabbage." 
Then I quickly slipped to my place. 
The girl next to me has made me a big smile ironic, it found that it was an honour that the corresponding to sit next to her. 
The rest of the time was fairly calm, but when the gong was music, I have been pounced in the rules. 
Everybody talked at, pouffait of laugh and I did a lot of questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, they have all got their Bento. 
My mother host me had made this kind of Lunchbox - it is really something other than the paltry sugary snacks. 
I had rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Good, except perhaps the plums salt confites, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools. 
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the summer recess. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am interested to know if I could see here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" Asked me my friends when I said that I wanted to spend a year in the classroom at Tokyo. 
I always responded. 
"Because it fascinates me," 
In the end, read mangas, that is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture which is, at a time, I have also started to learn Japanese. 
For me, it was very clear that I had no travel a day. 
Because I also have a soft spot for the traditions, and traditions and customs. 
And here, it gives them a lot of importance. 
On one side, Japan is the country of technologies and latest trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And everything is so well, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. " 
Rats are also of sensations 
A rat or a cold turkey shirks the danger, has means that he also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how could verify that it has the same thing when he behaves the same way that we? 
In the magazine online "Edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
Spiegel ONLINE present in a series of articles for answers to the question "What do you think be true without proof?" 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of conscience without me or anyone else has until now could prove just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all the human brain are the same situation. 
As soon as we turn to other species and that we are the issues of felt or in general awareness, we move in difficult terrain because the Hardware do not match. 
When a rat is a risk, it did the same thing that many other animals: the penalty, fled or attack. 
Human beings behave in the same way, that is why some scientists infer a comparable lived subjective. 
However, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of difficult animals. 
One aspect is that the circuits involved almost always to the human consciousness include the Cortex prefrontal Cortex (of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and execution). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans and other primates and seems to be completely absent in others. 
The least for these aspects-ci of our conscience who depend on the prefrontal Cortex, to which the conscience of who we are, and the ability of providing and decide it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even differs from other primates. 
Another significant feature may be the linguistic nature of: a large part of its existence has linked by this often means that his conscience. 
In this case, it could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the by this influence, so that the animal awareness, regardless of how it is produced, would differ probably much of most of our awareness. 
That is why it is also difficult to determine at what may seem like the dilemma for other animals. 
If that, and subjective, neither measure nor, because of this Hardware particular, analyse based on our own experience, his observation we have serious problems. 
Most of my developments on the content of experienced aware, but there are also another aspect of the conscience who should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
We could study the process of animals without taking account of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term of primates, particularly with the example of the pictorial. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the correlations nerve of awareness on the mechanisms seduces: the two may be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realisation of the pictorial. 
But résulte-t-il then for the emotions? 
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of the fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we define as "fear" is the mental state we are in, when the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reactions of the body) owns of the acute memory. 
And observed, emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex the primates particularly. 
Subtle degrees of felt, associated with our volubile nature, can be seen, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorisation of to charge other to us. 
Instead, Antonio Damasio for example that the sensations from primitive activities in the regions of the body of Cortex and the waistline strokes, as Jaak Pankseep which focuses more on the brain syllabus. 
As this network is not much changed during the course of human development, it could actually participated cross-cutting sensations cross-cutting every kind. 
From a purely theoretical point, I cannot contest, but I believe that prove. 
Pankseep coat-tails of the fact that this is as fear in voda and in rats is also identified as such in both cases: how could yet whether the rats and voda feel the same when they behave alike? 
A cold turkey shirks the danger, but if he felt fear? 
In my view, similar behaviour are not enough to prove the same experience. 
Admittedly, the comparison nervous aid: rats and voda possess common-core cerebral, the cafards by against do not have a brain. 
But has the waistline brain is at the root of sensations? 
And even if we could do this for humanity: how could the show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I do not know how the show. 
And because their sensations differ probably completely of (since the human conscience is based on special circuits and the by), I prefer explore the emotional behaviour that the emotional sensations rats. 
In all cases, progress are on the nervous in the registered the same thing in rats and humans. 
As I not exploring the by and the conscience in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We could see this as the short-term, but I prefer to move on rather than bumping constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed a émotionel pragmatic.

Of the dark influence the flight of the probes space 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in perplexity: of the dark influence the speed of space probes during the maneuvers Support gravitationnel. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in space. 
Because of conductions of fuel soon jellies, the death cryogène the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause uneasiness among researchers - the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
The gravitationnel support is a ploy of space probes, by which they get an extra boost in the scope gravitationnel of a heavenly body, the earth. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe of research américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens used this trick physical, just as the probe solar Ulysses. 
This is what surprised researchers for years: the wheeled objects are not always to 100 per cent of the way that awaits the venerable laws of gravity. 
Much more, irregularities came at the level of the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly find faster or more slowly. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this. 
They referred the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
Some experts fear that the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the power of attraction here because of the curvature of the area, may not be entirely correct. 
The physicist American Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes strongly that Einstein right a and trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitationnel support to the aid of the so-called black that astronomers will have identified in the universe. 
"The black might be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes. 
The researchers in the area know about the black area only for about ten years. 
It is apparently it an attractive effect observed on other diabolic body. 
She, by contrast, is completely invisible, that is, it does not sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the black would be a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.

Companies building to the bill B 
The British companies building may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interest of this loan will be paid by the companies who collect money from savers, including 59 companies. 
The director of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles has stated that it is "irritating" that companies and their members will pay the bill. 
The loan of £14 billion will be paid back when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released. 
But the interests that are at the same time, will be charged, every year, the 700 financial companies who collect deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that 59 companies building are included in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have had a wise … must now pay some bills of institutions who were much less prudent. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
All that every society must pay proportional deposits that it has, and that the companies intermediaries must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will run in 2009, to £450millions. 
This means that the companies must find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the trade committee of the building, told the BBC that the decision was unfair. 
It is "annoying" to see that the institutions that have had a cautious approach in the of the housing market, must now pay for the institutions much less prudent. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the first annals. 
"We must examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks to assess the options to prevent companies building and their members pay this bill," said Mr Cole. 
The interests for 2009 cover seven months, at the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Given that the companies building are organisations without shareholder, their member end up paying the bill by costs higher, or by interest rates lower for the accounts.

New investigation in the case of American prosecutors. 
The General American lawyer appointed a special accuser to check the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006. 
The trick is born of the case of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some cabinet officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and the former Prosecutor General, Alberto Gonzales. 
The survey is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is the to political causes. 
The accuser Spécial, Nora Dannehy investigate any now whether the officers interviewed during the inquiry, who lied to the investigators, obstruant justice. 
"Serious accusations of conduct potentially criminal, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved," said the Inspecteur General, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special capable of forcing witnesses to table, was one of its most important recommendations. 
The dispute began by radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors made by the US Department of Justice. 
At the time, the department had said that the prosecutors were dismissed for cause of poor performance. 
But it emerged, that prosecutors dismissed were not more criticism that their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to these political connotations. 
Some prosecutors have been accused to be close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate the charges of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
American prosecutors investigate and the judicial authorities for the government. 
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be candidates for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, the Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, accused of being involved in the case of dismissal and, at the end, he resigned. 
A number of cabinet officers Department of Justice have also resigned. 
The report by the Inspecteur General was very critical of the role of Mr Gonzales in this case, saying that it was considered "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and will eventually "abdicate ’ s role as a leader," they co-operated not involved in this. 
Other officers, including former collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticised for having failed to cooperate in the investigation.

A Rue Sombre in the City, Souvent Oubliée, and Peut Be Soon in Sale. 
New York has hundreds of Avenue, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some well-known, others merely functional. 
And even some taxis veterans as well as local residents long know go to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of. 
The street is in the East Village and the north of First Street – not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet of broad for 120, it resembles a dusty gone rather than a lifeline active. 
. Some signs indicate the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a real standard. 
This street has admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent buildings of luxury on First Street. 
He would repaver Extra Place, and create a smooth passage to the stores and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including neighbours, were happy by this shortcuts simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of pâté houses. 
But the Department of Preservation and Development Immobilier of the city which manages the street, has no interest in the bear. 
This month, at a meeting of owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal allowing the manufacturer to buy the street. 
But the committee would prefer that the street is in the hands of the city, and has asked a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No 3. 
"Little remains spaces in the city, and we hope that the city retains Extra Place" she said. 
"They could offer to rehabilitate and manage, as Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted repaver the small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee that the manufacturer sauce. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company intends to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner. 
The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this go away, and "she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale". 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, in addition, that the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than the handle. 
Compared to its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historic footprint. 
Some believe that Extra Square is the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm of many children of Philip Minthorne was split, leaving away this small, which stayed since abandoned. 
The entry after the CBGB, a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has re open to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photograph in coverage of the album of Ramones "come to Russia" 
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scrap, ragged, barriques, went, leaves and ropes. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already spoken to the evolution of the luxury of the East Village, were opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that that humble small property should remain public. 
Other proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareté- a piece virtually identical to the city that should be done in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who drives a blog called Jeremiah' is Vanishing New York (sous-titré "The Book of Contestations: A Regard Amèrement Nostalgique on A City in the process of Extinction ') recounting the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Square is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and based on the doors of a warehouse in iron rust and persiennes, full of newspapers last week which are soaring along the gouttières." 
Has few exceptions, the street was always the same. 
A rat short agilement at the bottom of the alleyway, almost a door which was previously CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store stylish. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer from 22 onces vacuum, rests alongside of newspapers that have just been cast. 
A few passers-by said they did not think that rarely to Extra Place, and suggested its value. 
Mr Field, for its part, has said that he thought some under felt the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "took place in places, wetlands and repugnant". 
The Debate Institut: Immersion in the English language 
In this part of the programme of Supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss of the position of the candidate on the bilingual education. 
Make T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the department of education Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Well that You do the Pensiez. Why they should be able to choose their school." 
Attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr Obama points out that "students African-Americans and Latino have less chance of diplômer that whites students." It is a true. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports in particular among many other subjects, "Education pursuing transitional bilingual" for those who learn English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether realizing a bilingual education who defends the instruction of languages other than English, only to remove the differences. 
For example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the of the convict of Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low incomes. 
More than a third of students, many new arrivals, studying English. 
Among the students CM1, 100% have passed the state math of 2008, an expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students past the examination of anglais-de langues-d' arts 
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient that made by Mr Obama. 
Sixth Street on analyses, practice, a constant evaluation capacity and exemplary attitude. 
And more, and that is an example that Mr Obama could copy, brings Linda Mikels, of Sixth Street, the school has established the instruction of the English language "full immersion". 
The total immersion in English language focused on the almost constant use of English in the investigation. 
Ms Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, has confirmed that "we have had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you go without his class, you would have had a chance to identify." 
", takes account," it worked for us " 
Mr Obama should not take example of Sixth Street Prep and the continued in other schools made up mainly of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves, but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for the National Education for the bilingual education) and its huge support for the bilingual education, obscured the pronostique of the response from Mr Obama. 
Although it is in the immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently seen this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
"Instead, he said, 'you must ensure that your child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it would then consider carefully, models of the education that work, rather than dismiss or as insignificant.

Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan in favour of financial markets, will be able to revive the economy.

It took the second time, when the Jets transformèrent a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under dark clouds. 
Then the quarter back 'Brett Favre has managed to make a turn to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, foreshadowing a after midday when their relationship has taken a quantum leap.

When we told him the deux- the Jets have lost 21 points recorded in the third temps- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third.

Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title of best athlete of the century, after having beaten his own world record in the marathon in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of a race accommodative stance on the flat, Gebrselassie has defeated 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, disputed last year in Berlin. 
35 years, Gebrselassie has won the 26th world record of its successful career during which he has won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, 1600mètres marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- can be overstated in the eyes today - that the air pollution increases its asthma. 
On the contrary, it promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost parfaites- time sunny, 48 degrees at the start, the arrivée- Gebrselassie has won Sunday, now an average impressive of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The runners runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into runners, have contributed to the record marathon of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa became in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie has said to reporters, have suffered crampes at mollet two weeks before, and have been training for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest had been brilliant, but not rust. 
"I am so pleased," he told the reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I called the last week, and today, I had my doubts, but in the end, it all went for the better. " 
It has reproché- above all in Kenya, is African of the Ethiopie- of having too engineer its racing, avoiding the stars global marathon, relying on the hares as if they were in a race run, and considering more world records that the meaning of the competition. 
But this does not reduce the greatness of Gebrselassie as a runner.

Two runners elite Kenyan, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to defy Gebrselassie after the leaders of have disappeared.

Kamathis is coming third in 2: 07: 48.

The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko of age 36 years, has surprised everyone even winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.

Askale Tafa Margasa Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a City to Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Living Black 
Hidden in the development of a vast park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet small town where are the pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, first city entirely black to integrate, house children of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that it did in 1935, is no longer so simple to do these days." The city in the five lakes, three short of croquet,, 300 skins foncées, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not from prison ". 
It has become a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Idol every year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in different ways, the city he describes - has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tour guide of the Florida published by The Depression - era Federal Writers ’ Project - remains a place. 
It is also independent, dignified, and that it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, "we know so little, does not know what it is." 
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious eye from abroad. 
"We are very careful on how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, resident and the oldest paroissienne of the city. 
"It must be in keeping with the reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It represents both a model historic a takeover of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of culture rural black sudiste- few once scorned, others acclamée- which recalls the birth of the American slavery. 
This why residents are proud and protectors. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here is Hurston. 
It put forward his home city to the world through books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide to the Florida transformèrent this town, just at the exit of Route 17, a road which is at the centre of the Florida, often forgotten, which in chapter of history and of the human drama. 
Bold such a big cash in life as in literature, Hurston has conducted the readers the shop of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"The road on the left," writes, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these areas well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care of, that we know to read and write. 
It pointed also mention of the new husband Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and that everything that can be used for. 
Therefore, barely a hundred words, Hurston combined Eatonville to a cheap government but also to the analphabétisation, on remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not. 
This was not a portrait that everybody disliked. 
Zora is well described the reality "said it Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Hurston has immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who louaient their beauty". 
She added: "some people did not like. 
Remember always Hurston as a person and eccentric, who frequently after his family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, rappela that Hurston Piper usual in city without warning, in a big Chevy, a cigarette in the mouth and was of trousers here, where even today, is proud of traditional dress. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin told, whereas many laughed. 
"People were still happy to see Zora" he said. 
But he also balançant in his chair of patio arse which gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly called, that it was never too long ". 
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman from Barnard College of the 1920s, it was buried in a graveyard, in Fort Pearce, Fla, where she lived. 
Has Eatonville, no great commemoration, or plaque for the general public. 
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy that it provided in the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped verbatim Rainbows ", a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s. 
Public officials of Orange County wanted a motorway to five routes in the city, to replace the boulevard Kennedy, main street to two lanes of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already sent Interstate 4 until the west of the city. 
The proposal was made when Eatonville healed just a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mix of races led the hatred on the gates of the community. 
"At the time, a young of white youth would launch oranges or objects against people on the side," said Mr Franklin. 
"A lady is dead." 
They waged a watermelons of their car. 
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Court Supreme to a forced integration, its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race. 
Residents now shouting that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although in some aspects, has been the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakened the confidence of young people. 
"Black children used to be embraced - I remember - we embrace our master the morning and evening 'said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of it Dinkins as well as head of the Sauvegarde of the Community of Eatonville, a group profit. 
It lasted, ajouta-t-elle that, until teachers and students nor did more of the same place. 
"You embrasses not tone professor Paper because it is blanc- I want to say that it is here, a line of cultural 'said Miss Nathiri. 
The civil rights, moreover, have helped to create space for other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who went in damage, as, armed with a cheerful confidence and lines of action such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!" 
It is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was on the grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true'avènement, the réintroduisit thus cannons. 
The project of the motorway is just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville had regained its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours Hurston regard as a sauveuse. 
The community has started to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences would provoke the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans came at the opening of the festival after two years, and in January, to commemorate her. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the motorway to five, extremely rapid, a genuine civic pride" said Miss. Nathiri. 
Ms Boyd summed up the entire declaring that "Zora has saved Eatonville". 
The victory against the project of motorway has enabled him to change his own image. 
People non-resident, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequent our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents were likely to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library mono theme (renamed obviously Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: to six miles to Orlando, it can to call itself as a back street after during a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's. 
(Today there are 90% of blacks) 
The foreigners who discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still viewed with caution. 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of the Old Church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, representing black men in the champs- must not be photographed. 
Much to Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a teacher and which has a soft spot for the red, are still afraid that their island community is well understood. 
However, given the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, mad and composite that other ethnic groups and racial in America. 
That is the affection civic sincere deployed in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or by the forces of Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for the very young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville. 
Most people, which are in this area, will think: 'Oh, this is nothing compared to other "Alondra Kenon said after the church service last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very beautiful city ". 
Here in New York, all speak fluently. 
Despite all, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan took away from the newsstand and screens giants of TV Times Square, they do not make that they are in the eye of the storm. 
Never may think that in the glass and nest of bee on top of their tète, bankers and managers of hedge funds that grab New York, are the worst 'day working in the office "since the crash of 1929. 
The men continue to slip on the pavements, with their trolleys and trays of muffins for the meetings matinières. 
The Latino are always between the residential blocks, as who made mistakes, 50 top-of-the shirts hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office still queuing to buy their sandwich matinier to the itinerant traders, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and ostensibly. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I décidai of opening a new savings bank. 
Fortunately I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I découvrais to my local JP Morgan Chase, a score of people queuing. 
Not to at the cashier, or to withdraw from the race or make a payment, but the shop of customer service, where the usual clients commandaient their checkbooks, tourists for direction for the shop Macy, and new customers began. 
Most of those, I apprendrais later of Starr, my "banker staff allowed", were all the queue for the same reason. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money accounts of savings or thrifts (such a society of the building), associations of credit, and the type of building local savings and their subsidiaries which do that in a state, and who say deal with customers and their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt. 
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank capital 327 $has made use syndic of bankruptcy, and while New Yorkers were returning to the house for the week ending on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, accounts savings to a total of 440 $million, sought désespéramment a buyer for the save. 
The office and employees of shops that are, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred money to a bank that seems reliable, is the most rescue on Wall Street. 
Of New Yorkers Baby have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a woman in my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the telephone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bust, and of its meager Director-General Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could have been able to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, the doorman in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my fruit and vegetables. 
She said, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the market. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take of risk". 
Muslim graves desecrated that Austria fluctuates to the right. 
Heinz-christian Strache, who gave up the right wing of the party such as Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Right Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration for the organisation of "cities against the Islamisation" to Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008. 
They wear road signs of mosques struck off in red. 
The Police accuses the right-wing extremists to have desecrated a cemetery Muslim Austrian, the week ending the victory of political parties of the extreme right wing to the general elections. 
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, between the night Friday morning, according to the police, of a campaign. 
Criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Etoile of David; the detectives believe that it could have been done to conceal the feeling of hatred of extremists in the Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could somehow be linked to the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community declared that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just for the month of Ramadan draws to an end. 
Austria think seriously to his courage, his oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two parties who have descended almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have waged a campaign anti- immigration. Some of their slogans were even seen, according to the critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party which won more than 18 percent of votes, has led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the food alaha. 
During its final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Polls and the analyses conducted just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political of the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.

"I photograph the master of the stage to capture elements of its" Günther Bauer - Photographe 
Neither heels, no clothes of transgressing. 
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed of all tensions to obtain the relaxed rights or of the woman. 
On the one hand, the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
Inseparable except privacy, in these times unknown to the general public, where it of gestures and medical of sight stolen of artists who do not care to get up on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixture in "Flamenco - people 'the théâtralité of few stage management with singers, dancers and guitaristes with this side lesser known artists. 
In the draft, the photographer captures the special iconography of flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the planning of the Mois of the Photographie Flanders, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," writes the creator, explaining that "Flamenco - people '" can be anybody but, having seen the photos, the observer finds that they are not typical images of artists on stage. 
These people photographiées "in the street" are artists able to transmit on stage of the passion, the sadness, joy... in captivating the public. 
To catch moments of personality of these artists should not be photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
This passed was to create an atmosphere which allows me to capture with the camera of personality stars of flamenco. " 
With the festival "Chant People of Mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long journey for photographing singers, the guitaristes or the dancers with a camera to mark. 
These are the portraits, which, with the choice of the camera and hardware, consider the classic photograph. 
The implementation of different stylistic breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots fluid and surprise every day". 
It is not the dance or song, but to the personality and the nature of the artist who is the public with his art. 
Research is essential and the magic has been the constant of this work for these days here to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from approximately 70 artists photographed. 
The project has been a pick out of flamenco, which will be published in a book collection of portraits exposed to the gallery.

"Sangre de Mayo ', the gamble dared to Garci 
Following reports of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous Battle of Spaniards against the French in "Sangre of mayo ’, which is the film the most ambitious of his filmographie with almost 15 million budget. 
The filmmaker has tried to put in the many characters and illustrate the social analysis "that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría to the head of the long list of players. 
The film for a period of more than two and a half hours, "Sangre of mayo will make his release in cinemas next Friday, then a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci for having done with this camera "a dream of child 'thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who instructed, three years ago, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story looks at the national historical facts. 
The 15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid are for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the settings and clothing appropriate the atmosphere of "a Spain which has mistaken for the battle since, the fight for independence has led to the people of rebellions under the Ferdinand VII," he said. 
But the filmmaker regret not having achieved a funding as for films "Captain Alatriste ’ or ‘ The ghosts of Goya ’ - more than double that achieved for" Sangre of mayo ’, because he could not turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire career. 
The filmmaker of "Volver has empezar ’ has influenced on her usual way to work, on the direction of the players, with whom he has a habit of repeating before starting the camera and to whom it does not cast, since it seems" humiliating "and that" the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and cinema to keep inform ". 
Many players in "Sangre of mayo" repeated before the camera, as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or of Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Four times the Oscar (he has won a), Garci considers that the three films candidates representing Spain this year to the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre of mayo ’," Seven tables of French ping pong 'and finally the winner, "The blind tournesols ’, are not representative of the young Spanish cinema," which would be better known, "he said. 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
"At the beginning you believe that you travailles for posterity, and then you realise that you travailles that for prosperity, and now you are happy to make a film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career. 
Isabelle Bayón puts himself in the skin of the dancer sévillane Tórtola de Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay tribute to a dancer sévillane dancer. 
Carmen Tórtola Catalan de Valencia, daughter of a father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a mother (Georgina Andalusian de Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the area of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with his family. 
It was a almost dance free and specialist dances. 
It was an exciting life, pioneering the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and plaida for the abolition of the corset preventing the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who has marked the history of things in the interwar Europe, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last offered me to interpret the almost sévillane Tórtola de Valencia and this has been incredible". 
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate this way of thinking. 
The titles of his dances have the flamenco. 
As well, "the dance of the butterflies' reminded me a dance popular Cuban and" the dance of the snake "to some tangos. 
His dancing was sensuous and they told me that my way of dance was identical to, "she says. 
The scene is thanks to two outstanding proposals: Miguel Poveda which chantera again Isabela in one of its viewers, as he had done to "The puerta abierta"; and of Professor Matilde Corral, who was exceptionally well liked working with which was his pupil. 
"Matilde transforms Tórtola in a mature. 
I am pleased that it has agreed to play a role in my and my honour ". 
The scene is also thanks to music composition and guitares of Jesús Torres is Paco Arriaga, to the pop song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga are Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the violates Rafa El Viola and to the cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were regarded as Nationale". 
The play tells also, in a way, the life of this woman who has shown in very remote locations, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also in Europe, since it was usually in London. 
"I wanted the back because I believe that these are the women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights his", says Bayón. 
The show begins to 8.30 the theatre Lope of Vega 
The publication of the "Official of a poet recently married" concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated the "Official of a Poète recently married" in the Church St. Stephen' is in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez is married with Zenobia in March out, is part of the framework of activities by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia, to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for Littérature and their deaths.

America please less without Paul Newman 
"Of both God created people perfect 
Paul Newman was part ". 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "Absence glee, and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is not of this world. 
It was to obtain a Oscar 
It is more since 2007. 
Everyone knew that he was ill. 
It was a blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," began crying Robert Redford, "my life and my country were best thanks to its existence. 
No one was afraid of getting ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the home died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are scared, American is low, desperately searching for reasons of dignity. 
When times are hard and without reason for living, there is the human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda for like Paul Newman. 
It was for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the battle anti-drugs created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has had the death to hold out against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive of admiration balayait Hollywood without attention or nationalities or passports. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that no James Bond, died before him. 
Another Englishman, whom some Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, not appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We has set a high bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only today trying to break the screen like Paul Newman: very honnêt and with a privacy serious and far-reaching objectives. 
It is not always easy or possible in the media jungle of our days. 
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, it was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward were, to which it has been true even if the opportunities they were not to be. 
But why should I eat a hamburger outside of home, if I have a bundle in my fridge? ", he used to joke. 
Heaven, he is hubris to its girls with its fans on land, something which is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the major roles that he has interpreted, has never been more proud that the husband dedicated, father, grandfather very and philanthropist", disent-il. 
Madrid in the race for the Olympic Games in 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid to hold the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved in 2016. 
But I wonder if we are ready. 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday: we are not! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race that I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, it would be a éliminatoire note. 
But look in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes start with the withdrawal of dossards, which you have to go ahead. 
This is not easy, but if you are moving it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing). 
And no 
They you did go there only for the dossard (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there is only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
Where are we? 
Est-ce-t-il due to the crisis that they decided to buy that indeed small with less fabric and the cheaper? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the races. 
Aside from the fact that go early to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes, and more, it must be backpack. 
The debate has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible that 11,000 people are expected for these races. 
Since there is a long queue, competitions have begun, and we had left our in the entry, although once, the withdrawal was worse. 
Moreover, the rain has accompanied the waiting for 40 minutes during which took place rebellion and assault of baraque. 
I believe that around 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will be not in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me, which I believe did not properly. 
Of course, if they asked me to mention an example of a race, it would certainly not to the idea. 
And I believe that we can still dream of becoming the city host for the government of 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a see (virtual) 
Has the conference on the Technologies Émergentes MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of Intelligence Artificielle with intelligence but able to do some basic tasks, such as take a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to visit the campus of the company) in response to what it was asked in a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "see" can know how many people in the place, which they are - including remember what posts they occupy, and listen and hear key of their conversations. 
But also bring in groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, the see detects a third person but she understands that it is not the group which is speaking with it and that it is not part of the company. 
It asks him if she is to visit someone and she said that it will respond in a few moments. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we spoke in more than a change of strategy for Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will be fewer programmes. 
Steve Ballmer has found that the computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would five times faster. 
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not been added and "perks" to Windows. 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses importance but also its software. 
When Google chrome came on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete to Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the hardware and the software understand. 
It occupies the same function that your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never but we must see the "death" of the system not as an absolute truth but as a truth about. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are becoming less and less attention to operational system but far more on Internet browser. 
We switch on the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or chrome and every day people to spend more time on the Internet than to go windows. 
Has that half the applications given with the system? 
Perhaps the most striking is the least. 
And Windows 7 will contain less applications, much less than Vista. 
Less, months gridlocked, less complicated. 
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own services on-line to finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need it, and I shows you an example. 
The photo in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rooms rest for employees of Microsoft to Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own research tool for - "Ta research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study found that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to look for information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or in 2010. 
Microsoft will surely to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after all, to a computer. 
But the launch of Android being delayed and the iPhone being already on the market, it will cost them dearly. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio bore a in the 'Diamant of blood "Edward Zwick, that Al Pacino in' The Parrain' Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of gay heavy-handed. 
And if we start to list all its appearances, one might also cite this costaud moustachu which created weight in a circus. 
This is not a simple jersey of male body cotton, milling and without sleeves. 
The English call 'is' but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels is among all the other. 
First of all, by his flamboyant - although it is known as the 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport as it takes the name, according to the legend, of office Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
The "Marcel' differs from the other by its cotton excellent, for its World Cup single-sex, by its logo and by the Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the shirts of the best-known have in the neck. 
But attention, because the Belgian marks does not only tank tops. 
But it also produces sweat-shirt, of retro boxers, of cardigans in cashmere, of trousers in cotton, babies, of mini-shorts... 
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear. 
Even though it is unfortunate to wear only as underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to become a young mum; the candidate does not worry me" 
Its huge resemblance with his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality. 
Currently the sisters Cruz take seriously their new activity in the fashion industry. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls beautiful and famous who give their name. 
She was present at the promotion that the Mango has done in Paris at its new headquarters but as well as the presentation of the most important price of the way that the Spanish house sponsors. 
Monica and timid. 
Raconte-nous what you in Paris. 
I have come new collection that my sister Penélope and I have for Mango for the new season autumn-winter, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of Opera in honour of Valentino. 
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, us. 
Why your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season? 
The cinema of the 1950s and 60 we dazzles and we are very much for our collections. 
I very much like me out in the city and observe women to see how they are clothed, how they combine their clothes, I often do. 
Almost, actress and dessinatrice, you are a woman very versatile: is it not? 
I believe that yes but at the end of all joined and these activities have much in common. 
Since I am very small clothing me plaisaient; I désirai go to my grandmother to watch in the cupboards of my auntie and to see its clothes. 
It was crazy, almost better than to go to theme park. 
Then, when I became almost, I was always take care of my way to dress. 
The dancers like drinking even dress for the tests, to look in the mirror and feel well. 
And in the role of actress, when you endosses the clothes it is at this point that you put in the skin of the man. 
The coup, everything is connected. 
You had not long ago 30 years ago: it has been hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years cheering. 
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and relishing life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock does not fear. 
I have done all the things that I wanted to do since small and this has given me a lot of internal happiness. 
So, think you you become mother? 
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks me and, again, I would like to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that. 
As regards the candidate, I don't worry. 
What I will do is to give much happiness to my son and to raise with great love. 
The cinema, you expect the various films that you have turned last year. 
It is true, I wonder that they come out. 
I am a woman from of the theatre, I am very anxious and worried, I would have everything now but of course it is not possible. 
I have been anxious that the films "The última hora 'and" In busca of the tumba of Cristo'. 
Do what you think... 
A few days ago you commenced on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do say no! 
I am not fitted the to the model. 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know for a long time, to invite me to participate in London to a parade of charities for its association in support of women and the clothing that we exhibions - I have exhibited two clothes of our collection created for Mango – were sold at auction to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person in the move. 
They say much on it, I know, a lot of things are not true. 
Moreover, the right side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to go for a noble cause if, but if I had to ask me to the poirier, I would have done anyway. 
It is important to make life better for women of the third world. 
Repeat offenders drink-driving will install the system 'alcolock' 
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver, who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to resettle in his vehicle a system which prevents to initiate the vehicle in drunk, or if it does not. 
The initiative has already been announced last June and it is now in the report by the Minister of State in this initiative is regarded as a pilot project which will last for a year. 
Its aim is the reinstatement of the driver in of road courses re-education. 
The Minister of State for road safety but also the Directorate General of the Security Routière and the Foundation Technologique Institute for the safety of the car involved in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having done more than once by drunk, includes the car. 
The alcolock would avoid this because it is a system link to the vehicle which measure the rate of alcohol in the process and to start the car if the driver does not before; or when the driver of the driver is higher than that. 
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver. 
Here, a study in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with the device were driving up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain this could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure is to administrative penalties for two reasons: against them before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by normal channels but, however, the reform by criminal waterways requires a reform of the organic law. 
The mechanism is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form, although some industrial vehicles and office already has a to experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes installing in the school buses this system as was done in France.

Speaking in sleeping 
Few children speak during the night. 
I am not linked to those who woke very awake in narrating something happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
The first time that this has happened it may surprise you, but in reality it is of no importance. 
It is a benign sleeping called somniloquie. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is certain that there are more than a who speaks through the night. 
This phenomenon can appearing very sporadic (once in life for example involved in an episode of high fever), or more periodic (all days, once a week, once a month), the day after the child remembers nothing more. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other changes of sleep as the nightmares, the terrors nocturnal, the énurésies night-time (do lunch in bed) or the sleepwalking, but it is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong found, to situations of stress or of become agitated. 
In any case it is a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with which it is also very variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a small voice calm, with isolated words, noises or with cries, tears, of long speeches... 
In the case of the somniloquie becomes overwhelming, it would be good to see the child and to consult an expert, to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that it is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another of sleep that can be treated (for example, if this is linked to a apnée sleeping or stress). 
What can be done is to take into account a number of preventive measures very simple: 
Try not to annoy the child before going sleep. 
Therefore seek games alone and avoid of the programmes or television series that are more or less violent. 
With very nervous and children who have to relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help calm internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear to remain calm. 
Remember you that they are safe for the child and the next day it will remember most of what happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not get. 
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Even if he is talking about, he sleeps and therefore assumes. 
Remember you that it is very anguished several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or to check this as anxiety in children. 
If you understand what he says (which it is not usual), have not the temptation to ask for information. 
You will achieve nothing, because in sleeping, it is not aware to organize its thinking. 
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming, heed to the way you interpréterez information and to the conclusions you draw. 
Say never to the child that you can question during the night for its secrets. 
Not even joked. 
This causes anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing bad, it is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern has finally returned to the victory at home after a long period of food shortages. 
Without a match, the Jaunes and black are the largest number of occasions and have managed to transform a for the match.

In the face, was bloc in the middle of ground and it was just great Riahi to the tip of the attack. 
The start of second half would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned for a ball back on a first attempt to Diebold (53rd'aretz). 
But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to savour happiness and will be forced to return to the field a dozen minutes later and leaving its coéquipiers digital inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not know use and will not pose major problems to a Eleven illhousien which has just fallen a little for "compacter" defence, except in the last few seconds of game, after a bumbling, the ball was very close to the case.

Obama, wins the points in the first duel televised 
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has followed another as to who, John McCain or Barack Obama, has won the day. 
Unsurprisingly, the HQ of campaign Republican and Democratic proclaimed their own victory in this duel televised which would have been followed by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been enough "brilliant" to curb its low in the polls five weeks of the presidential. 
The Gallup, an opinion poll published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), it is the democrat who blew out of the game. 
Among the voters undecided, which are those who count, Obama has won 39% of those polled, while 25% of them are giving the victory to McCain, according to a poll CBS. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the good provision expected of his colistier, Joseph Biden, the first and only public debate with its rival, Sarah Palin. 
"This would be a mistake to underestimate. 
It is has good instincts "however, has warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has been highlighting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues which were at the heart of this first contest. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and expertise needed to be president," he also assured. 
A of attack out since yesterday in television advertisements republican. 
Obama, he stressed that he represented the future. 
Without them, it was concise and accurate. 
It has demonstrated its ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has not understood, while Obama, if", said this weekend, a Democratic advertising spot accusing the Republican of not having realised the full extent of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street". 
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, in 20 000 personnesrassemblées for a rally in Caroline North under a rain battante. 
He has not even used the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial advantage clearly Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most able to save the economy on the brink of disaster. 
"The next week could be a turning point," said yesterday, the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic Rahm Emanuel, a former of the Clinton administration, has compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that measure to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the implementation of a system of health care. 
McCain, himself, wanted a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030. 
Careful, the two candidates have ducked questions on the bailout of $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
Has Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject advance the results of the parliamentary election. 
A few hundred people gathered Sunday evening from the closure of polling stations on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of elections. 
While no result has yet been announced, many young people were demonstrating against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation". 
Some admit having not even voted: "A what good, since they will do what they want to my voice," said a young man. 
They do not believe that the regime that has to foreign observers to resume talks with the European Union is ready to a democratic change. 
The sanctions, whose visa ban for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were regarded as own observers. 
They were not in the opposition. 
"We have been removed from electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of twelve parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, highlights Alexander Milinkevich, former candidate of the opposition to the presidential of 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important that counts the votes, and among us, it is the executive power. 
If of members of the opposition are in parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament can mean of space for television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws. " 
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "we must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do not reform, we may become a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent. 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which followed the electoral process recognize the validity of the ballot. 
It points out that the figures of participation seem too high, and that the use of vote by anticipation (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all the manipulation. 
"You have noticed that there was an election, you? Asked the leader Social Democratic Alexander Kazulin, one of the two remaining political prisoners freed in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those best suited to the power. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
Has television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission welcome their success. 
The meeting - Du blood have become course 
Héma-québec yesterday was the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, the Dre Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the suppliers of blood more security and the world. 
And importantly, he has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously damaged by the scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, the national reserves of blood managed by the Service of of the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the virus immunodeficiency gained (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
Before this drama and resentment, Canada's government has instituted in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge giant Krever, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster does not happen again. 
While the judge Krever belatedly to file his report, some provinces have set up a committee for planning a new management system of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has accomplished this mandate. 
Following the reports Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec for service the Quebec and the Canadian blood for all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec has started its activities, just 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Dre Décary. 
The situation was daunting. 
To efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public, "says before said proudly that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population québécoise had confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Dre Décary however that "the confidence is extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, there were in Europe at the beginning of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant CJD, says that the strong since its founding in 1998. 
And we did not know if the disease was transmitted by blood. 
It is based on one of the main recommendations of reports Krever and Gélineau, that when we do not know, and that a serious disease blunder, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a degenerative brain leads inevitably to the death, it measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, has rejected the blood of people who had been more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
However, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle has been applied makes sense. " 
In 1999 came on the market a technical much more sensitive for HIV: tests of acid nucléique (TAN) which detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not one of antibodies against the virus, which were the tests used. 
The TAN have helped to shorten the period, which stretches between the time the person has been infected and where the virus can be detected in the blood by our technical, explains the specialist. 
It has this period to less than a week. 
It has dwindled substantially the risk that some donors are infected unknowingly and that we can detect. 
These improvements have helped to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of given blood contaminated with HIV. 
In other words, it means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission from a blood product. 
I believe that it can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health ", says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogenic reorganization in the system. 
As recently as last year appeared on the island of Reunion the virus Chikungunya which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
It must always be vigilant, "the Dre Décary before to emphasize that, in addition to a security supply, Héma-Québec a sufficient supply. 
"The needs are growing because the population is ageing. 
The anti-cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red or platelets. 
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who rolled into average 3% of Québécois eligible blood donation. " 
Anyone in health, 18 years and meet the eligibility criteria can give blood all 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of people who have their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria, they will be excluded for a period of a year. 
"With 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they mature and can no longer give blood. 
It is difficult to persuade people to give their blood, but above all to remember and to encourage them to become regular donor. 
The life of today are so frantic, rarely the time for one hour to give blood ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone greffons, heart valves, eye globes and skin which is almost exclusively used for severe burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Héma-Québec which administers the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia. 
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it predicts take more than a thousand per year. 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "the Dre Décary which describes this programme of cord blood as very popular. 
"Several mothers are disappointed to have access to", because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and costly in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - The Impact in semi-final

The number of Canadian is ready to start the season.

Kovalev gave the victory in the aim of the shooting.

But I think that he appreciated the end of the match. 
It was a nice ovation. " 
Charest placing on the North 
The Prime Minister does not trigger elections before the end of the year 
As soon as the county council's Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest has visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of the by-election today. 
"Push the limits of our last great northern border": that is the ambition long-term that Jean Charest has presented with visual while remaining within the lines, the county council's Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin to images. 
Some circle, on three huge screens, clichés clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by Google Maps ", cards, etc. 
Of the major means as election period. 
In point of press, moreover, the Prime Minister has refused to rule out that it would trigger elections this autumn, although it noted that it was very crowded. 
The 'Plan North "is the fourth phase of' vision 'that the prime minister claims for the Quebec, that of a" new economic area, which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister has however been to explain why the North was "a jewel in the immense potential", but has not given deadline, Investment, nor amounts of priority in future projects. 
At most roads of what could be developed further: hydro-electricity, forests, but the mining sector, boosted by growth from emerging countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platine, however, money, iron, titanium, and even diamonds," according to the listing of Mr Charest. 
This "territory twice as large as France", "that is, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is, but it is we, "he insisted, as to make it clear that it was asking a founding myth. 
Quebec is much built in its relations with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the québécoise engineering, the Bay James. 
", it is up to us, our future," he added, after a dramatic pause to look at the huge map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebecois territory, includes a portion Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has said the prime minister at the point of press. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government, "he said. 
The rest, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision North," he said in the north-west, starting the year due to the melting of ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister, believes that his is a must. 
And the people of the territory, Prime-Ministers Nations and the Inuits? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the draft their benefit, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from both parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP péquiste of Ungava), have already begun consultations with around 30 communities. 
A US chaired by Benedict Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources) has an important place started work. 
The Prime Minister does not preclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "there will be a common vision." 
The development of North should be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "concerted, ordered, and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest has described this' vision 'as continuity with that of first minister Liberals before him. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we thought that to turn challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the recurring themes of the end of the week, which began Friday by a large cocktail for the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
A resolutions proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout. 
"Godbout, which has created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who has done the quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, Bourassa who has done the Bay James, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest. 
In point of press, he invoked another reference, conservative, the programme "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963. 
In the of Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest has stressed that its service was scheduled for 2012. 
"It remains between us, but I can be," he told its militants, causing home of applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of an election this autumn, what the law allows it. 
He stresses that it is, however, by a mission of the federation in China and a summit Québec-New York. 
The General Council of the end of week has provided the Liberal leader a platform with nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" who are past as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls for particularly the recognition "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
It also hope that the Quebec appoints of members of the Council of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications and that they have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, has welcomed the broad outlines of the plan North with scepticism. 
The chief péquiste, Pauline Marois, has been the development of Nord-du-Québec that the government Landry had launched in 2001. 
According to them, the liberal government, he took office in 2003, has refused to apply. 
If he had done, 'we would be more advanced today "commented Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot today), Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has said the adoption of a Plan North by the government. 
But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle, "commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing of Mario Dumont, which returns from holiday today. 
Letters - one country dishonoured 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice "(oh, irony) in the cabinet Harper, which enabled the last summer say of Louise Arbour that it was a" shame "for Canada. 
Throw the opprobrium on this woman who has been a unending struggle for justice and worthy of our admiration in also says something about the Prime Minister on Stephen Harper itself. 
We find ourselves in a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have brought back its national in the concentration camp of Guantánamo. 
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the events, which are accused. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its floor and lets in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only turns to a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
International remember, for the record, that UNICEF, amnesty and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, have been calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he has a fair trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that condone torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, without doubt, never after so many years of violence. 
It is not yet, but we are at this moment to a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper do constantly brandish and Whom if hollow in his mouth. 
Now is the time where no moral no longer exists: they can abuse, torture, imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen for the benefit of a head of government previously minority (what will happen after the 14 October...). 
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that the Vertu, the Law and Bar: they do not see that this government has abandoned to the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, it is, in this instance, not elsewhere. 
Free - The speech Orwellian of Barrick Gold site 
In its edition of 17 September, The Devoir has published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold site. 
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, assertion that the largest gold company of the world has a continuation in defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the in order to launch a "public debate". 
It is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they think, especially in the case of libel prosecution, but the law. 
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold site, the best way of conducting a public debate would lead to ruin anyone could support a position contrary to his own? 
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book black Canada will spend large sums to prepare their defence and, very unequal arms, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mining. 
The tactics, in these lopsided struggles, is often of ruining the defendants to impose an amicable arrangement which bâillonnera the opposition in addition to frighten anyone dare to revisit the issue. 
If Barrick Gold site really wanted a public debate, is the public that it was to present its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what happens in several countries where works Barrick Gold site, the debates in Canada are normally by the exchange of ideas and not with. 
It was the mining to open its books, and to establish a true debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold site seems not to trust the public and from the of the petitions and letters of support to the perpetrators of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how it can ask us to a debate 'public' all the opinions of the same public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it seems that this word means only lawyers highly paid and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics have a right to speak. 
What does not understand - or does not understand - Barrick Gold site, is that the public supports the authors and publishers of black Canada the mainly because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining. 
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold site just to table a formal notice of the authors of black Canada told to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the speech surréel of Mr Garver, the pursuit of the Barrick Gold site is a direct assault on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to a democratic society. 
It denies, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on the facts and the interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to learn and discuss topics that dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution, who will be able to do this? 
If Barrick Gold site really wanted a public debate and transparent, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic world, which, has long been known manage the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The pursuit of excessive Barrick Gold site clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments are put in place devices limiting this kind of prosecutions abusive. 
Rescue operation of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the largest rescue plan economic since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan $700 billion dollars to try to reduce the financial crisis rocking Wall Street for months must still be approved by both chambers of Congress. 
It includes: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the use of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, as well as a look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news for a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
"We have made great progress in terms of an agreement will be effective on the markets," the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
Everything has been done to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans in the ongoing crisis in Wall Street ", explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The talks had been sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect that would create a new failure on investor sentiment. 
The time limit was given was the opening of markets this morning. 
Associates late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were disposed understanding, without fail however to express their discontent that it took to get to that. 
The Democrat Senator Obama is the addition of some provisions in the agreement, to allow owners to keep their home and on the salary of the leaders of companies rescapées by the state. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not much to be pleased. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the American television. 
On another channel about whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The lines that I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said. 
The $700 billion to buy back with taxpayers' money the bad debts, assets and unsaleable of financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble which has led to the collapse of the mortgage market (subprime) before spreading to other forms most of credit (PCAA) and on a freezing of liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans that wrecked the first draft, the last week. 
It is to be out of this impasse since that the Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" companies in difficulty are provided by the government, rather than purchased. 
To cut corners for everyone in Congress, has also added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion will add another 100 billion if President deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be approved by a vote of Congress. 
In exchange for assistance, Washington obtains equity in the companies rescued him worth of dividends in profit and that it will sell when the turmoil will last. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the property loans concerned by this plan, and to set limits on the pay and expenses of the leaders of the companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would be put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and to the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices have continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican camp democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington do not hear you," said to voters the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of taxpayers. 
Leader of a small group in Congress nick-named "the caucus of sceptics", the Democrat Brad Sherman presents the matter differently, but came to the same conclusion. 
Four hundred eminent professors of economy, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us saying: calls in Congress for not hurry and to look at the path to take, "he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, a new show of the global nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalisation of banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would acquire its rival in trouble since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the sub-prime mortgage and the United States. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of 20 major European banks and ten largest insurers. 
"This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, they make a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is something that savers and households like now that the time ahead. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank abandoned by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take all the loans at the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion (75,5 billion US) of mortgages. 
The bank Spanish Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and the customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second, after the Northern Rock, the British Government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
Its beauty to blue was long its card asset, some would say its weakness. 
Was liberated from mirror narcissistic, the American actor smile charmer? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was sinking of source will also removed from the register of power actually the real sacred monsters. 
But what great long-distance athlete! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, 83, as a of lung cancer in his ranch Yankee, remains one of the few icons of American cinema of the good years. 
Less monumental that Brando, to which he resembled and which he was long a rival to the screen, more cautious in its game, certainly more fragile, but apostle also of freedom and the splintering of conventions. 
The agonizing mixed often beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots into a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without unreasonable egos, ultimate stamp of quality. 
Because it is projeta a whole country enamored of self made man, fighting of the war in the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied art to Yale and fréquenta the Actor' 's Studio in New York, before to the theatre, television, cinema. 
The same man who milita for civil rights was also the pilot car pilot classa second to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, a sex symbol, a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward were. 
Also disappearing with him the twilight zone of this secret star, unobtrusive, committed, allergic to bursts of show business, which do not have to pit the enigma. 
An honest man, in the widest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought dizzying the cinema goers at the end of this week, then collide its major roles on the screen black of memories. 
More than a century of a seventh art American ever-changing running fast through him. 
Are themselves by memory the cowboy of charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Chatte on a roof burning adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closest to us (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed his old age by a marriage which does not meet all its promises. 
As other Paul Newman at history. 
This office Rocky Graziano,, harried, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Dr (Marqué by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, continued after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956. 
This small-time appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (The Arnaque), Oscar for the best film in 1973. 
Player of bitter ping pong and vengeful in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the figure on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which won him in 1987 a single Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
The times are through its journey. 
The young are particularly through the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey unorthodox. 
Its fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Mafia Irish in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
Against several legends of the film, which lâchèrent early enough, Newman will remained long in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its on, its contentment and its concessions. 
The filmmaker French Bertrand Taverniers was considered, not without humour ", as a living challenge to the" underplaying "considering its benefits him too much. 
The profession has not always been kind to the Paul Newman in which the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
He played less often young first that the marginal: névrosés, alcoholic, bastards or desperate, its perfect features reflétèrent the fads and revolts. 
As director, Newman became facets poorly understood its true sensitivity both forgive. 
Its Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel Canadienne Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward were in the main role, 'an end portrait female of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott overdosed him dédia his film Harry and Son in 1984, of modesty and sad. 
Among the rain of tributes déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former colleague Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, disappointed: "His presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love of the existence are traits distress disappeared control. 
Across his career of legend, eliminate a great campaigner for civil rights, ecology, the independent cinema, a of the excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen many its binette grace pots vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, the process of poor taste, joke. 
The profits from these sales were nonetheless paid to his Foundation for childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than on his myth, will be used until the end. 
It has left its five girls a letter containing these phrases: "Still and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his lucky star. 
It was a privilege to be here. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist if lucid and so generous. 
Citizen model, and in addition. 
That could well make Zuschlag & East in their factory to bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will start the hearings relating to criminal procedure, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanent and regular, having generated damage especially important. Other charges have been made against them, for example, and use of false. 
According to the public prosecutor, the money from subsidies, was spent for personal use, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
Money from the state and municipality, approximately 65 million HUF in total, was a in the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of certain people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was the money of subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fresh, behind which no real provision was provided and the associations break never their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of bills were false. 
For these, they from books of bills to Józsefváros, while they fabriquaient stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies which were displayed on the bills, it was decided, among other things, the touring provincial North Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on request János Zuschlag. 
According to the statement, he should identify of pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked a bill, on the model of which they see the other bills that they would introduce, among other things, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipalité of the Capital access to subsidies. 
The majority of the bills was created by István Lados and by his accomplice András Őri, which according to our information, took most of the files for subsidies. 
In a "circuit to", a choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two bills from the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that many people in this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the foundation Jobb Jövőért, who subsequently will bear the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait of mistakes of forms and substance. 
A pension, based in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact that three chambers, and maximum ten people could spend the night, but the bill was one hundred and thirty customers. 
Issuers of bills to the imaginative have also fallen, when they mentioned the society Pigal Kft, even in the hotel and catering sector. In their books, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért, nor the Hoppá seaports, according to the information given to the public prosecutor. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the society, said the site hvg.hu that when the public prosecutor has called and showed the bills, he has successfully, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our number of tax were placed at a wrong place on the stamp." 
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that the bill, 100 people were housed there, not very truthful either, as this establishment that eleven chambers, which do not have as many. 
In addition, the bill also mentions of the meal, and the restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
Issuers of bills zealous are not informed on the travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising travel abroad, naively, they have indicated that stays in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, which also goes to the accounting practices of the agency. 
Of surcroit, as it became during the investigation, they was also VAT on these documents, then the benefits on the activities of trips, including the destination is outside the European Union, are paid without VAT. 
Similarly, the rate of VAT of four bills established in the name of the Hotel Révfülöp to the agenda Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the benefits of society do not pay VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel only emit bills printed, while the false were prepared to hand. 
The investigation from the reveals that the "issuers' have also made mistakes in as provide the transport of goods by road, that the company sending bills could not exert, given that his profile was the in investment. 
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, as types of bills inadequate and fake stamps, that the invoices to order Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Pont have proved false. 
As in the case of the society Ravenna Bt. or sporting aptitude Kunfehértó, who both deny being the authors of the invoices in their name. 
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that the society HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the official of the company denies issuing this bill. 
Bills set deliberately 
Another category of issuers of bills is made up of those who were fully aware that they were asked to send fictitious invoices. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a bill on the agenda of the Foundation Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, for a total of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the society Collab Kft. was led to false bills by one of the accused, emulate Györfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the society Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, issued bills on the order of the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for a total of around five million HUF, but behind which no provision has been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices were cancelled by the end, but this, the bodies have avoided mention in their accounts. 
The category of issuers of bills is that of companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of the society Delta Trió Kft., caring Trade of fuel and vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was found, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the society has issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment, for a total of approximately 18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, these devices have been bought by the Cash Investment Kft. society of Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of this society was a man of Romanian origin, Iván Kubatov would have also received documents in connection with the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov has acknowledged during the inquiry he has issued bills to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he has earned their worth. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov Romanian bricklayers have created societies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment BT. 
In reality, none of these companies did, that the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work. 
It meant all of these companies, and at the request of Maître Zsolt Szente, coaccusé as well as editor of foundation, it issued bills to their names, the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov has given to bodies, 15 bills in total, made by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The public prosecutor thought that 10% of are indicated on bills and VAT in the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the society Szi-Beri Bt. to for fictitious bills that have been used in the context of the request of subsidy for Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért have applied for a grant from the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They have this subsidy for two 500 HUF, but these have not been used for the objectives included in the request. 
To avoid that this does not happen, five fictitious invoices received from the society Works Team Kft. were presented at MRI. 
Moreover, these bills that have been found during the raid in the office Árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, a part of writing the method of manufacture invoices, as it had already done before the public prosecutor. 
What could be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on history. 
Until now, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised on several occasions about the details, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement whereby in exchange for the return of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would vitiate the hat. 
Today, it is probably offended, since the requests for its placement under house arrest, on the basis of a relief in his conditions of detention, are constantly on deaf ears. 
While those who have caused damage much more, and the authors of economic crimes not repairable, roam freely, or at least expect in their own homes at the end of the procedure. He did not. 
The psychology of the auction: why dépense-t-on more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
Researchers neurology and economy of the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this behaviour and apparently irrational. 
Their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dependent on this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and this is why they even prefer pay too high a price. 
These searches have tried to have a neurological pattern of this type of "game" to the aid of experimental auctions. 
A groups of volunteers was lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while with the aid of a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), researchers studying the brain active areas of experimental subjects. 
In the two games, the participants could make money, but during the auction that a key element is the surfeit of a third, the whole under the brain waistline, called striatum, was in movement of intensive way of the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto-stimulation" the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is the flight before the violent reaction of striatum. 
Has the support of their theories, economists of this group of researchers have analyses of financial supervision. 
In them, three groups surenchérissaient faced with a partner, in particular circumstances. 
They have simply informed the control of the actual value of the product in question, and they have done their implementation. 
Another group, they have promised that if, in addition, they were winner of the game, then they would receive extra 15 dollars, rewards. 
While the third group has received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group were also the money, where they lost the bidding. 
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed in one on the victory, while in the other, on failure. 
In demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players' failure 'were willing to put more than those made by the group and the group "for the victory. 
"These results cannot be proven by any economic theory already under way. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena in auction by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk. 
Only the methods of neurological imagery have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now, on a third explanation. "- Found Andrew Schotter, Professor in the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when are we to consult a doctor? 
In the world, around half a billion people suffering from hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the top causes of death. 
Estimated to thousands of patients carrying the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles a treatment. This is the fact that often patients do not know that they are carrying the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infection of the liver and caused by different virus. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaunisse are characteristics, but the pathogens and diseases caused differ. 
The virus hepatitis, according to the genes, spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus by blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginal secretion, spittle). 
For passengers, it is recommended to get inoculated against the virus A and B. It is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A are two to three weeks after the consumption of food contaminated, in general, accompanied by a bad condition, of weakness, of evils of stomach and nausea. 
Then develop on the skin and the white of the eye a jaunisse visible, the occult become clearer and the urine takes a more anyone colour. The healing can take two to three weeks. 
Throughout the world each year, a million people die of the worst form of the disease, such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that after estimates, only one patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most of the sick is not widely known of virus, because the gene pathogenic destroyed of underhand cells liver. In many cases, the first symptoms appeared after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, and that of regular screening. 
The contamination is far greater than the average among a population of three groups: those who have suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, consumers and the tatoués. 
Currently, we figure to 200 million people suffering from hepatitis Type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult his GP from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in the risk of infection disappears and the development of a cancer is warned. 
The 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representing patients around the world. 
Its goal is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who believes in God has he less pain? 
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of painkiller, which would have already helped to make more bearable the death of the Catholic martyrs. 
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford have done an interesting experience looking at what level the belief in God could influence the tolerance to the pain of the human being. 
In the context of this experience for the bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and atheists have been subjected to ECT, while each of them was a painting depicting the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the Catholic believers have been able to exclude much of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of human brain, was also discover that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brains responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, of academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians are from different sectors of the university. 
More precisely, the experience of as follows: an instrument with sparks and broadcasting the ECT is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
The researchers asked the participants of the experience of watching sustained two paintings, being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 1600s and the other, the Lady in the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci at 15ème century. 
Researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary is a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a scanner scanners, and during this time, have received 20 ECT in four part after, in the paint to religious theme, was the in more general issue. 
Catholics have said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "security", as someone who "taking care" and "quiet, and the invaded". 
Has the painting of thematic religious, they have reported 12% of pain in less than when they were watching the of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, which itself has the experience, think that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, atheists, to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find an image which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, exchange indeed our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, there is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the suffering of the issues if we continue to believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber? 
Is it that the sight of a Virgin Mary of better quality would better results? 
You are what you divulgues to your subject 
Has the opportunity to its tenth anniversary, Google says that you can be found at the bottom of the pockets of people in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, which experts they visit and what their interests. 
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the people of the influential society. 
While in the sceptics establishing a parallel with the horror of Orwell, they are not the bulk of Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their original aim was as follows: "Recueillons in a system all the information in the world!". 
According to the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a global disagreeable, they are still at the beginning of their objectives can deal with all the information. 
The question: what is there in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow? 'or' What is the work that would best?", but the software will respond to this type of issue, simple at first glance, that the day that they find enough on users. 
It is not quite clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer which launches research and the pages accessed by people are listed. 
Through the programme Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can consult what they have sought, on which they clicked. Through this long-term, recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences. 
What happens if someone is using my data against me, if we look at what is my work? Ask users, who are seeing the monopoly of information from Google. 
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by the company that can cause of fear, and it is not the compunction, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can cause in a contre-réaction Internet users. 
Justifiable desired however, it is a fact confirmed that the terms are not only registered, but in cases, they are sent to a third, and in this kind of legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most notorious of these days is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google has sent to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the page called Orkut, thus enabling an identification. 
The surfers mindful of the rights of the individual may have breathed a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm with the body of legal protection electronic EFF, has proven its right to court in the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request of the FBI, of any kind. 
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully with some 50 addresses web and 1,000 terms of research that it had won in tightening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years earlier, but in the end, it fails to acquire the lists of research private users, nor the whole list websites and keywords months.) 
The trial of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is criticised by those who fear the transfer of their personal data, because they believe that their intimate and their private area suffer when they begin to use Google, and therefore they engage them in the spirit of revolt that manifesto against the multinational companies proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the culture geek American, and its "sauvageons" with the fans, the activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of large companies, the "corporation trendy," by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, even if all the two are fighting for the same goal. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users to identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The code documentary and the package of programmes, continually refreshing, has a much more accessible, more and more uncool, faced with the practice of giant official software. 
The reason may be that the geeks see exactly the relationship issue between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and that the Web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed of recent years, just behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something that the cooperation, that the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we use of the channels of communication available to us, and while the dimension of exchange one by one, the crunch remains the same: himself. 
Or last.fm, listing its musical habits, a young, in general, can take a profile on several pages, of Facebook to Xanga, and it can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing its musical habits, and then it can connect to a tracking system, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also take blogs, in which are automatically their most recent galleries of photos they stock on Flickr or on Picasa. 
While you may take many examples, such as the girlfriend which includes easily at the sight of the photos, taken by the circle of friends, with whom his friend unfaithful has spent the evening, or of the society that has dismissed one of its employees, in the opinions that he wrote on his blog on the top management, we may be on one thing: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider. 
Live a life on-line, consists of what it shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of young people today. 
He wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do (starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the system of research Google, but, at the same time, leaving intentionally no trace). 
The number of people who deliberately, does not on public pages so that it is not possible to find, is not insignificant. The services of Google on-line, via the text for the treatment of image, the information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to enormous parks servers and assemble not our best profile, having seen until this day. 
The public expects, without really hide, when Google unveiling its true nature. 
The society, with its current value of 156 billion dollars), is worth more than IBM ($140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of increasingly important cause serious migraine not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers criticisms are to this, the contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the society has refused, in its entirety, the protests, after it has doubled the price of the tongue and after that the company has considered too expensive restoration multiple daily, any time. This pales next to the fact that already in 2006, Google has assented to the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company sees all the results which injure the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to an internal rules of society, the new services are not announced until they can be used. What is on it is that, in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that the draft for and archiving of books and magazines Google takes the so important dimensions that society will soon to the Supreme Court of the United States, other shuddering to its system Health, because in it, you can build a medical comprehensive profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a genetic data can give a good raw material to the next generation of authors of fiction. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian demi-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached so outrageous nothing to data from Google. 
Two 16-year-olds helped to wipe away the traces of double homicide of Ózd 
The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of double homicide of Ózd. According to suspicion, they have helped to wipe away the traces of crime "- said the spokesman of the police department Borsod. 
Young people have recognised the facts are accused. For the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two 16-year-olds, which, according to the information MTI (Agency Télégraphique Hungarian) are girls, defending themselves free. 
The complicity of murder may causing a detention of up to 5 years. 
The double homicide of Ózd, a young man's 23-year-old Sunday, has been placed in temporary detention, Sunday. 
The charges against him are murder multiple, deliberately with and interest. 
During the inquiry, it is the young man of 23 years was a lot of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not resolve its debt and that is why it drew his creditor, last Wednesday in a site of Ózd where he was killed, and the little girl of this man, aged 9. 
According to the information MTI, the young man has sunk its crime. The weapon with which he would commit crimes hidden on the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police considered the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The stock of Warsaw made a proposal for the takeover of the Prague 
The stock values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion kronor Czech, to buy 100% of the package of actions from the stock exchange values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the stock exchange values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that Polish have made despite that, previously, the Czech have ruled out the stock of Warsaw the circle of potential new owners of the stock exchange of Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the stock of Warsaw is owned by the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to secede from more than 60% of its actions in months. 
According to the business daily Czech E15, the proposal of Polish represents the highest which has been made so far to the takeover of the stock of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, in Vienna, the stock market transatlantic NASDAQ, the Stock Exchange of New York, London and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the scholarship of Prague, said last week that involved, Warsaw is the new owner get less, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the stock market in Prague in the future. 
The value of the stock exchange of Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion kronor Czech by the specialists of the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments on Tuesday to the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, the leaders of the European press are already a "second 11 September. 
"The overall financial disaster, we saw the American president" - accused the newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised hastily, aimed to help a depressing situation..." 
Instead of the new Pearl Harbour, as was the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
A part of the press Madrid also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership there who has led the world economy on the verge of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and later, the world will pay the price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote, a real threat, that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the air, just at the time in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes. 
We cannot ignore the threat longer - highlights the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some can still offer a lifeline to their financial bodies titubants, and with the help of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing such dominoes, and financial resources, or of new improvisations are sufficient. 
Long term, we need the states of the European Union did little notice of their national egotism, and that they centralising control over financial markets. 
Nothing that on Monday, the financial weakened have received more than 100 billion euros, has reminded the Viennese, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers also will have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a similar to the US with the aim of finding a solution to the crisis, are becoming more realistic. 
Until now, the EU has not really in the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crosses, hand in hand, the old continent. 
The "rescue" must not use of 100 billion euros, for against this would be good if they notaient in which case it would be reasonable to affect the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage. 
The intelligent car imitating the bourdon flight 
What method would be best to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if this is the imitation of a detector of obstacles that already exists in nature? 
For example, of bees. 
In the draft surprising presented at the CEATEC, in Japan, bees bourdonnantes have given the idea strategic of departure engineers to at Nissan, for inspiration on how they should introduce the next generation of detectors. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system to control auto-robotisé bio-inspiré, type BR23C, that he has equipped of the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system to avoid obstacles. 
In its flights, each bee is its own space, oval form, which in reality, very similar to our protective secure - explained, in the course of the exposure, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of research and development and public technological relations of the brand. 
The it to facets of the bee plays an important role, because it is able to see in all directions, in a corner of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the it to facets, the engineers have raised the idea of télémètre to laser. 
It identifies the obstacles in a corner of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the chip, which got maneuver Negotiator. 
The perception of the obstacle in a split second, and then the mini car robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, changing the direction of his wheels in the shift from a light enough to avoid the collision. 
Unlike any system currently exist, this manoeuvre of avoidance is entirely instinctively. 
"If this is not the case, the mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratoire Mobilité and the car robotisée project. 
It must react instinctively and instant, since this technology is the most vulnerable and most of the envelope of protection, a coat which for the moment the collision is inevitable. 
This process must reflect what the bee to avoid other bees. 
The process must take place overnight. 
The opposite of bees, the difference cannot go to the bottom or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way to the place of endless combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, it could use that the movement rotatif, the acceleration and the slowdown as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses batteries Lithium polymère which are lighter and the energy is bigger, which makes their duration of more than in the version Lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, this is the intelligent instinctive reaction which is paramount, not the handling of data, and the ability to store. 
This mechanism must treat that some signals entrants per second, and respond to them. 
There is no need to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvring. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of memory continues. 
We do not need of memory capacity gigabits, nor even méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the concept of a technology for the instant avoidant personality disorder. According to the estimates of Nissan, this system will its entry in the old cars in series in the next ten years. 
Another application could be his inclusion in the GPS satellite navigation system, to guide the driver to its destination in avoiding obstacles in his way. 
It has even been given a name the baby prices out of 
The written version of the plan of economic rescue of $700 billion to buy back the credits dubious of banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of that will be spent. 
Reuters announcement that during debates go until after midnight, on Saturday, local time on the east coast, the leaders of Congress reached agreement on the controversy for days and days, about the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion. 
"We have taken a significant step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the US House of Representatives, after which it remains is to put the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, it is supported by the two candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in a comment on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and it will be effective, however, other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question, the bailout of Wall Street, but to turn the workings of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday night at 20h local time Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but has not provoked spectacular rise in the stock exchanges. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding on behalf of economic stabilisation of 2008, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush has spoken to Pelosi, then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the advanced violations last night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House. 
Moreover, the programme diverges from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it, was that the $700 billion would be spent at once, and to buy securities on dubious appropriations. 
Now, as half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first will the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad debts of banks, while the use of $100 billion of additional dollars will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will take part. 
The cost of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the Treasury will implement a combined strategy: they can, at the same time, buy bad loans, securities on mortgages and dubious mortgages, as well as other types of debt "toxic". 
The people in charge of the ministry said that the takeovers can take place in the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule provides an opportunity for the companies concerned, to take part in an insurance programme, where the secretariat Treasury guarantees the tools to the origin of the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson has said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars to the urgent needs of the financial system, be it the form of a vast buyout of dubious claims, of their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system triggers the collapse of a major financial institution or another. 
We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed "- he said. 
However, the leaders of the banks in bad stances and waiting for the help of the state can expect that their redundancy payments, called simply golden parachute Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The capping of wages is mentioned only in very specific cases, and the restrictions on how the secretariat Treasury proposes its aid to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury buying in the framework of an auction, they fund a tax on the golden parachute, unless President of bank discredited left to retirement. 
Directly after the buyout of bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders should not be exaggerated. 
So that the image, it should add that the golden parachutes existing have not been modified. The capping is that the new contracts, to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that of the ceilings legal will be in force on the allowances of the directors-general - has said the chairman of the committee on financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
Moreover, the state provides a right acquisition of shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will rebound on their legs. 
The draft law says that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal which will decide on the way the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there was obviously those who have expressed their doubts about the plan. 
It is not what the American people we have mandated, this does not protect taxpayer dollars - has said the Republican member of California, Darrell Issa. 
His Democratic colleague democrat Ohio, Mary Kaptur think that these are the same people who are urging measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates for the presidency of the two major parties, have expressed their support for the rescue plan's government's $700 billion, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary. 
After negotiations matters which for days and days, the representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they reached agreements in principle on the rescue plan to rescue banks. 
This funding plan for the thawing of the crisis of Wall Street and the market credit paralysed, became the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are even, as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the polls the most recent, along with the implementation of economic issues, Obama has managed to get a bit ahead. Advance McCain obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as his running mate just after the Republican convention, has fallen.

The press of linguistic German 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - that is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of CSU in the country Bavarian. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the Internet edition of magazine of left-wing German, Franz Walter analysis the causes of the defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers'. 
According to this political scientist acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU started before the duo Beckstein-Huber takes office. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, these are the same modern citizens who are turning their backs. 
This change is the problem of the Christian democracy, and also that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not a surprise, but on Sunday, came to a process that was likely ago, just ten years: the question of national party ended. 
There are ten years, in 1998, the CSU is collecting with 47,7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This is repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, at the time of so raised Stoiber. 
The cause may be attributable to the modernisation "devouring its parents," in the region of consistent by the CSU. 
Been 40 years that sociologists say it but they have been deceived about the pace and secularization, the results of education and the establishment of German and North in the region of Bavaria, developing, could not stay away on the accuracy of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with the increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more and more obstinate. 
It is surprising that during recent weeks, the classic groups of citizens who are far from of the CSU, such as independent, artisans, holders of the box and graduates of senior studies. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "Who?? The party chairman will be on the reserve when faced with questions of the coalition," the Conservative Austrian is the situation of the internal policy confused which started after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ Austrian Socialists wish to discuss with the conservatives in the Austrian People's Party. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to meddle in its internal affairs. 
The populist BZÖ shows itself open to negotiations and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now revolves around the coalition; in the debates held at the public television, the party leaders have barely suggesting their cards. 
SPÖ Werner Faymann, President of the, has confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is actually possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the Socialist partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, Schüssel-Molterer has been, in any case, rejected. 
A replay of this combination is out of the question. 
Mr Molterer has reacted cautiously to the proposals of red. 
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann try to interfere in the internal affairs of the Austrian People's Party. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition and the entry into the coalition is not a question quite open. These points must be debated in the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the chairman of the BZÖ, is again open to all proposals. 
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of government," said Haider. 
Járóka has said: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, has started, in Paris, the European summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation in the House, as one of the main spokesmen of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, who Fidesz the European People's Party, has focused attention on the segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children, and one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French presidency, this high-level conference has been open, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, the European social partners, as well as the senior representatives of the legal protection and civilian agencies, in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of Fidesz People's Party, Járóka has warned that the distinctions in recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, in the wake of their. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma have no qualifications, and as a result of elementary education of poor quality, only a tiny proportion has the possibility of obtaining a diploma outstripped." 
Furthermore, Járóka has insisted on the fact that the education as basic right of the human being plays a key role when we must use the other fundamental rights. 
The early investment in education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the member countries of the European Union. 
According to the member, it is necessary to make us aware of these reports in a circle the widest possible, between Roma and the most seriously. 
Indeed, earlier a child Roma begins school, it increases his chances of becoming a member productive of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he is involved in the state budget. 
"By their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be confident of their right to a quality education, and be protected from education of poor quality and sectarian.", stressed Lívia Járóka. 
According to the cooperation of the European Union geared towards goal and a action is necessary for the of process desegregation of schools, and that the of the directives of existing anti-discrimination and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployed. We must give the possibilities insured by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of right to the future of Europe" - has demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the Year -- for the Equal Chances "guaranteed for all, the purpose of the summit for equality in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to provide a single platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and in the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and within the countries. 
CSU: thanks for a period of transition 
It is in October that the decision will be on the fate of the duo failed Huber-Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful election, the warheads are not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal questions heights of Bavarian CSU was postponed. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their. The question is how long will the pardon? 
The fate of the duo, who have suffered a loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the party congress, held the last weekend in October. 
The members of the pair heavily criticised have, in any case, is not taking to their seats. 
Thanks to this, to appease the States furious about the group and the basis, which one day after the Tsunami Bavarian tsunami "demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
Ago five years - that is true, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the pinnacle of his career - the union socio-chrétienne Merckx won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it remains 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the single sovereign "of Bavaria with 18% of its GDP. 
But, the Conservatives have always strongly in this southern region, of the importance to the Hungarian economy. The future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal review of the party, the Vice President and the Federal Minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, described as a possible successor to Huber, has also received a place in the modest group of recognition, which take discussions groping in with the Liberals FDP, as well as with the Electeurs Universities, trained the values of right-wing, about a possible coalition government of Munich. 
A strange nose fate has been that the of the list of Electeurs Universities, between in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, the measure against Stroiber has served the possibility of coup by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then deal with the very ambitious policy municipal woman. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now were behind the scenes, will also be an active role. The former head of the regional government and leader of CSU, has appointed the 28 September as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber has launched a sharp remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they should have received more support from the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor that if they put up in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, played an important role in the success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hiding difficult his disappointment by the fiasco, the loss of the land of the CSU is not playing to the grand coalition in Berlin. 
Which is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of Social Democrats has always. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0 
No member of the opposition came to parliament after Sunday's elections. 
According to the Russian observers, this indicates a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who assure him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is because of illegal activities made at the count the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
(ODSZ) seriously that Lukashenko, renewing its United yesterday although legislative composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants happens very much opposition for many decades, before the elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of Democratic Forces-New Nations (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time in dubious elections, on traces the changes to the constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced his boycotting the original plan. 
The fact that Belarus, dependent economically more of Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political order Belarusian described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several politicians high-level do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. The Belarus has a credit to the reduction of imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and has contributed to the society Beltransgaz, the owner of the of gas across the country, is in the hands of Russian. 
The fact that the OSCE, the evaluation of the campaign, has put the emphasis on the positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of the candidates to the opposition, referred to a prior appeasement. 
However, the release of the OSCE's Monday was already the campaign, during which most of the candidates, the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the count the votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is even a tangible improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have liberty, and Minsk is prepared to small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and the Abazzia separated from Georgia, but Russia with Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories since already a month. 
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate to the opposition in 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that remains, despite that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which carries no weight, of even one opponent". 
The opposition does not provide for actions protests seen results. It is trying to get his message on the need for economic reforms with the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns from them: we must give our newspapers printed opponents in Russia, the local authorities put a spanner in the works for the broadcast, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that under the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers the social security as its main outcome, the ozone of pensioners most supported officially is really as appropriate. 
"Because of the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, the collapse of the social security, evoking the silence of a graveyard ', is just a matter of time" - believes Milinkevich. 
Unlike the politician of the opposition, the Russian observers have described the elections democratic. 
Serguei Lebedev, the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words, but in deeds". In this way, the absence of the opposition is that the proof of the maturity of Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "A from today, breakfast before the work". 
Never in the history of the Palais Chigi, not had had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from today, has been in force this new measure against hypocrites, against whom and then drink coffee bar during the hours of work. 
The novelty anti- layabouts has been presented today by the Minister for the administration Publique, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors tournantes- narrate Brunetta- are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services' the minister. 
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency. 
"It is of reform" stresses in addition Brunetta. 
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency Council's complete with the Palais Chigi. 
According Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic standpoint. 
No resistance on the part of the employees was registered, Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all". 
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino to 7h the morning is a good and healthy resolution". 
At a conference in history Supérieure of the Public Administration 
Rome, the Minister states that "in three months, the absence of disease of public employees are 50%, 60milles workers in a year. 
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Publique Administration. 
Italian, "whose dynamic wage - explains the Minister - these 8-10 recent years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, united to contest the standards of the decree Brunetta doing the Codacons. 
"While the Minister of the Publique today projected data relating to the decreased absenteeism in the workplace for decline because of disease - writing the Consumers' Association - the people of the" layabouts assets "continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Administration Publique correct and productive, gathered to declare war on standards illegitimate in the decree. 
In particular, Tar, is disputed the exclusion of additional benefits in the event of injury for service; the extension of the hours of permanence intelligence of sick workers, during which are monitoring visits, as well as other items in the new provisions sought by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Conflict crucial" 
Every day, in Italy, 2500 of work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who are disabled permanently. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm, that the white deaths were approximately 200. 
Figures that attest to the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice more deaths that homicides. 
For the attention of institutions, social forces and of information on this aspect, the Anmil famous today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58ème Day national victims of accidents on the work, institutionalised the second Sunday in October. 
"The data provided by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message to the president of the Anmil, National Association of maimed and disabled, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its "sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort associative in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and raise public awareness" 
"Naturally appalled, everyone has struck down to put an end to such tragedies that, by their nature, the media and the involvement of the public, even if the daily reality from tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano will not deny that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is ECU to invest in training and information" 
The many initiatives promoted in the education sector, bear a particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people in the world of work. 
It is our duty, maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not assess the alarm on the social seriousness, and improve the standards. 
For its part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini has underlined the "this of white deaths is a social urgency, who insult the conscience of all of us, and to all the institutions, to make a specific effort to end". 
The data of the actual work seem to a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is impressive "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" trend cut-price "is in fact, in a minor attention, because that is when the attention is release, that is the tragedy. 
"We believe that in general, not enough is being done in contrast to the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be applied to many actions." 
"Us - has underlined Mercandelli - more checks and inspections are needed, as a more on the training of workers, and this, in school." 
He has added - "we must make an effort in the communication and public awareness. 
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which represents a social emergency. " 
"Mercandelli has subsequently denounced" the gradual deterioration of safeguarding of the compensation for the victims of work "and" abuse of assistance to which the system is moving over recent years ". 
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee insurance — he added – so that the fate of anyone who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or of the enlargement of the legislator" 
Mp3 reader pointed finger, they put at risk the hearing. 
Ecouter of music at full volume for a protracted period household appliances musical portable devices such as readers Mp3, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
This is what the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels, quote the Scientific Committee, on the health unforeseen risks and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This scientific report - read the note - it emerges that -10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listening to music at full volume household appliances musical portable, for more than an hour a day per week, a permanent loss of the hearing. 
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who use frequently musical portable devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage unconsciously hearing irreparably" says Meglena Kuneva. 
"'according to the scientific data - the responsible Ue - it is a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What matters more is to make consumers and make the information public domain. 
We need to review the existing control systems given scientific opinion, so as to ensure that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the independent scientific Committee, to study the problem, given the intensive use of musical portable devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate. 
"Scientists – concluded the executive Ue – confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now look with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could be adopted to protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from aircraft musical portable devices and similar. 
There is already a European standard safety limit the level of noise music portable devices 100Db, but the concern is growing about the damage hearing which could lead to excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to limit these data with use of solutions such as the reduction levels and the length of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Committee Ue remarked that users of the equipment musical portable devices, listening to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are currently in force on the highest level of noise made in the workplace. 
Those who are listening to music in such conditions for extended periods, risk permanent hearing loss of hearing after 5 years. 
Interested -10% of users of these devices, and their number may be quantified to 2.5 and 10 million people in the 
Rome, Alemanno has given the order to take the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we are in March, we conclude in June we learn. 
That is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital, which took place this morning, the new headquarters, behind the Thermes of Caracalla. 
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will the directives for Rome. 
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the local council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" on Capitol Hill and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Committee is totally independent; all the ideas political, social and cultural are represented - would like to stress Alemanno – it will propose ideas of development of Rome which can use the national-security policies, which remain the Committee and the local council. 
Any combination of roles, but only the desire for a corner where a great project for Rome. 
In March, it will finish its tasks and will then, because this experience must have a long time. 
In June the mayor - we will present the strategic product plan of the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replica: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be capable of doing, as well as the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on, his contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is frustrated by the management of the newspaper and emergencies that occur from time to time. 
On the contrary, we want to see, and further, to a more profound prospective, work on the development of Rome and its future. " 
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not a body unnecessary nor a bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will need to study and the best minds the Capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, "it a kind of strategic reference, neither firm or immobile, in order to enable our city, to improve, which it desperately needs, in its future now a spirit of unity,". 
A future which, the Mayor of Rome, "not only the usual borders local, but which will further 'not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and legal status of Capital, but also from the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Obama? The first anti-American president. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on both its decisions, destroyed the economy and were reports (as it always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy. " 
The attacks on Obama increase as the election draws nearer. 
A lady of Miami has written on a website: "this person is full of ambition". 
Obama is really rich: he believes that it will increase the leadership of a nation which in all, two governors and five senators black! " 
In fact, it is attacks which say not much; they are naturally attacks of racial nature, and do not respond to the question of all voters: will it be a good President? We have in the polls, who all claim that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not the brain. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, from deep within the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting, then we know who the American patriot will vote. 
That is an aspect of the American mentality maintained secret until the end. 
"What you want, we will see even to the cross, on Obama or McCain. 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we leave United. 
Things never revealed until now, to the extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winner card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
Asked about 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent responded: Iraq. 
America. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent home to kick the backside. 
In Iraq, 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain. 
USA, the economic debacle even journalists: in the press, it is the deletions. And many accuse Internet, this "murdering" of newsprint. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not declared the attached information, feel less worried about the credibility. 
They did not feel isolated as they once were. 
The problem of American journalists, it is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition, the losses in the newsroom, in the room where the authors to work in the collection of newspapers, are a big problem. 
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviews with, if we want the traditional media such that the public is, will be reduced. 
An obvious but complex pessimism invades the American journalism. 
Six in ten senior executives and journalists of newspapers are convinced that journalism at national level is in the process of a bad way. 
Locally, the group executive is to 65%. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
Journalists have not hard to see where the web. 
The largest houses éditrices is making a transition to Internet, seen by many as "the murderer 'of newsprint. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists is increased to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviews with have admitted to technology hoping that it "takes something good" for their journalism. 
Today, the time the greatest in the American journalism lies between who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "safety". 
The directors who lose their jobs in the space of three years, are 47% nationally. 
As far as journalists, we are going to 30%. 
The "safe working 'staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists work under contract. 
In a nation immense as the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it soon becomes a question of take or leave it. 
The directors are almost always big wages, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, besides retirement and the payment of insurance. 
The holiday, the logic is simple: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
This is the fault of the climate. 
Unipol: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The chairman of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the body of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who asked to be allowed to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of the instruction on the Unipol-Bnl escalation. 
At the trial in its burden, last week, he had obtained the compulsory freedom intelligence in residence to Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go the route of the city to a locality in the capital. 
According to the court, of such movements (that the entry has not granted) would allow him to influence its society and access to evidence that the him. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon was already a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan for $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of American was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street that to save the US economy. 
And this is the New York Times yesterday which confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its eve soul East Coast, moderate conducive to federal institutions and the business community, and its soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington and the world of finance, powerful, particularly in the Member Central and South. 
The soul, which is made despotic with the vote to be used at the beginning. 
However, the city is just one example of changes, big changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or leaves already run: not just to the US, but in the West, and can be not only here. 
The US, as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the over-nannying for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidifient and turn. 
The first of these is the update, the extraordinary revival, the double category sovereign Etat-, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis is, indeed, a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions which have, of course with close links abroad, but, above all, are involved, the balance sheets of people and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates a political problem for governing: that is to say as respond to the difficulties and the protests of people and families who are an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically World but politically, it is almost here national. 
The internationalization policy seems really off-side or, has little to say: the evidence we is provided by the European Union, which shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, to decide no common political line. 
And thus, it is of the government of each state that all of the interventions, "and of stimulation, new rules and, above all, a credit: that is going through a difficult period, there is that the states have the financial resources, the amount of financial resources able to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use: two resources invaluable, elements of which no market or international organisation can never have similarly. 
This new rhetoric of the crisis état-nation is the rest in perfect harmony with the always major economic developments most recent of the economy tend to give a factor enough linked to this element: the territoriality. 
And, paradoxically, in effect, although we were convinced to be now in the kingdom of network, technologically sophisticated, material, convinced that the figure was now to dominate the world, we now know of a coup one, that our future will instead settle its accounts more with things somewhat material such as water, harvest, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land, but which are linked to a limited, a territory. 
So, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that anyone who is not, that is, anyone who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I now turn to the second new that however provides a fracture. 
Who said territory,, Government, inevitably said policy, and therefore Leadership. 
In this, the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena converging. 
, an awareness of the need of authoritarian leadership, the research of one person who can deal with the situation. 
On the other side, a wave of disrepute for existing grandstanding, economic species which proved inadequate and full of grey zone. 
And furthermore, something even more profound, in a sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, and a picture of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the whole class of managers in a growing number of Country of the West. 
And once again increasing conviction of different classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen to and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the, at the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
In short, The request of leadership, fueling below, a powerful and more movement of délégitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are in the "revolts" electoral impromptu or, in the changes of collective mood of these recently, from the conservative ascendancy in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and it may be that the victory of the Right in Italy is not by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, as someone always have difficulty, which is not new, to understand and to represent the causes of Western societies, and that the economic crisis deepens, and holds potentially overact. 
The view of all this, talk about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But it is said, keep the full, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the side as Spiderman. 
That is the purpose of various centres US research, and today, a team of four institutes are almost succeeds. 
With a tape was barely 2.5 square meter, researchers have managed to maintain stuck a 100 kilograms on a wall. 
The ETUDE - The magazine American Science published discoveries of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those that we know who use a special structure carbon, called nano tubes. 
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have inspired leg of geckos, covered of kinds microscopic that will ensure the animal, a perfect adhérente. 
The testing of various materials, such as glass, Téflon, and the paper of glass, have shown that the new duct tape is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, "too easily to the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the to Ingénierie the University of Dayton. 
Walk SUR channelling MURS? "This material could be used as duct tape temporary" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the side as Spiderman? Can be that, yes, but researchers think to use much less fascinating that the connection between electronic appliances, given that the nano tubes are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could include the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, not super hero. 
The other research - The University of Berkeley, California, amongst other things too, in the search for a new duct tape. 
In an article in the journal American American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented a duct tape of microfibres as hair, clocking clean dust during the movement on an area for a perfect and constant grip. 
Medicines: never with fruit juice. 
Attention juice pamplemousse, orange and apple. 
These drinks, consumed the summer because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, alter the absorbement amplifying or reducing, their effectiveness, with serious health consequences. 
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, the risks of fruit juices that they are, in fresh sounding or fresh to ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236ème political meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, it launches a new alarm: just a glass of juice pamplemousse, orange and potatoes, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and risk the safety of patients. 
The juice pamplemousse has already been strongly criticised because retained responsible to increase the effects of some drugs anti- arythmiques, antibiotics, tranquillizers, anti- stem and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
Medicaments A risk - it is the Italian Agency of the itself, which gave the new in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients to do not assess the danger of this mix and to pay attention to this drink, if we take medicines such as, for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
Not that the pamplemousse - According to the experts, even the orange juice and potato contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by the pamplemousse and the other juice. 
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University Publique of Milan: "these findings are in general, immediately to the various agencies national and international of medicines that have the need, change the notes informative medicines. 
Should always read the papers making medicines that are, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but clearly the doctor or pharmacist 'stressed the expert agency Ansa. 
The Nobel Prize of the economy to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on the models of trade and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien which teaches at the University of Princeton and it is also a famous writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, the second event was more powerful than the first, in terms of impact on the history of the US. 
A forecast which unleashed to numerous controversies, and blamed the economist for years, but who now has proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or WorldCom, have disappeared from the public's attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a divulgateur style "very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, is the third edition of the package anti-Microsoft " 
This is the day of the spread of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity which aims to still more users, of the house, professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by developers volunteers, patrolled by SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office public know with various innovations: the screen of welcome, and the interface and become less dry, to other more important, as the compatibility born for the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
Also interesting, certain specific to certain modules, such as reducing the dimensions of the presentations PowerPoint, useful for example, send by e-mail, or to import queue PDF in the module of graph, the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this front, it is possible to create documents "hybrid PDF" that the graph typical of format Adobe to the elements of a roadmap of calculation or a winemaker of text. 
The collaboration between several people is something which has had various improvements to the internal applications: in the roadmap, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the draft texts, because each employee is a colour of comments for greater recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are even now work to certain functions OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud, on the trail), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and added to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the future is as usual available in addition, the system opératif Linux. 
On Monday, the cd of installation can be shipped at home or in the workplace. 
And if the theme of the free can be a way for the broadcast in homes, is in the business, Open Office later is the great challenge, can count on various projects in the administration and the schools. 
Without mentioning the realities that offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could also be open to prospects of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video handwriting equivalent of Word; Calc, is the calculation which aims to replace spreadsheet; Impress, for the rival presentations to PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the programme which allows to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the module graph. 
For 2008, to 5 million download, and now that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the figure expected 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth case of doping. 
New case review at the last Tour de France: the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey for the best climber. 
It is the site of the daily L Equipe which the new. 
Has 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests carried out on the test-tube Kohl are part of those in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the review at Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will forcement expect two years of elimination. 
The new of the review of Kohl's Epo of third generation, has been confirmed by the head of the French agency anti- doping, Pierre Bordry, which has provided to the Associated Press, have notified the review to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans placed himself on the platform behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, raflant thus the jersey to serve the best climber. 
Immigres: NEW YORK TIMES SE DEMANDE SI Le ITALIE TSE RACISTE? 
Italy "as emigrants Country of immigrants recently transformed into a priority destination for immigrants' welcomed with reluctance. 
This would be Th countries into a nation of racist? That is what is intéroge the New York Times who devoted a large article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, in the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a sounding of titbits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times describes as the "paradox northern": the northern regions are at the same time where weather "more integration and more work, but also a anti-immigration sentiment in the loudest and most important support to the Lega Nord" 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature sought by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the return of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI to the Quirinal, has asked that the state and church work together to overcome racism." 
Etudiants victims of rents, up to 900 euros for a chamber. 
The lettings market students do not know of crisis 
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the union of tenants, hire a simple can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 in Rome. 
The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to exclude entire groups of young people, the right to study because of the very high costs that the families of from must support - explains the responsibility of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in those cities, the strong demand from students has distorted the market that a process of widespread increase is amorcémême for the residents. 
In most cases, the offers to hire include a series of violations: contracts free, unregistered, without limit of rent, sous-locations. 
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions by the review of the taxation, are necessary to calm prices. 
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the area Brianza, it must be around 450 euros; for a simple, of 650 least EUR (zone Gaza Nere), to an average of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria) 
Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a chamber around 700 euros. 
Has Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, must be 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple chamber. 
Has Rome, in the central areas adjoining universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza gives), it takes approximately 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Values slightly lower (550 euro for a simple) for the areas of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save if living in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
Has Naples for a bed must be 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, spending 400 to 600 euros, with the higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
Has Bari, for bed, there are 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller towns, the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major part of the economy cities. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the lettings are often taken by students non-EU, there is a further anomaly: the rent asked foreign students is an increase of 25 / 30% as compared to the Italian. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities éliment gyms historical rooms. 
Cinemas historical are in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas is a city blind, it is as a face without" 
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, typifies what is happening in the large urban centres, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth outside of big multisalles, and the death of consomption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the greatest events which we believe is inevitable and, it has all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime. 
Has disappear, they are often historic places and for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone known, with which we have a long way and emotions" is the director of the Marche cinema Paradiso, film which offers Tornatore happened 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jurée of Cannes, and telling the poetry for a province, and the nostalgia of a way of life the cinema, lost can be forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the association of traders, says it all: in the past five years, 316 cinemas of traditional have closed, and the rooms of the main cities, which have paid the price: 10 less to Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less to Turin, 5 to Palermo. 
Among the most affected by the closure, Emily Romaine is in 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The evidence that confirms than primarily responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions which have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilie-Romagne. 
The Italian exploitation has developed uncritically "is Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it is useful to build new structures, but it to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to multiplex. 
Not to mention the missed of credit for traders: the antécédente debt of the state is approximately 10 million. 
It is shameful that, to an unethical and moral, the Government does not respect the existing laws. 
To support the sector, it should be between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city who, concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a memorandum between Town Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of historic centres and outside. 
Among the prescriptive planned, there are measures of tax facilities in favour of managers and benefits for the public in term of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the zone to movement, and will have special charges for parking spaces and in some parks. 
"This is an initiative that would be" is Giuseppe Tornatore 'and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by other measures. 
However, it is clear that, for contrasting the super power of multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is an issue which for me has always been an important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me of "New cinema Paradiso 'I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both been shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the signs noircis by the dust. 
Links between politics and ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of the office to the interests of the clan Piromalli." 
Heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Directorate of Calabria, the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external advertisement for mafia association. 
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the administrations, and her son lawyer, namesake of bosses, already condemned for criminal association of a mafia, and to pay 10 million euros. 
"An affront to the prescriptive legal and moral, and especially of good sense 'write prosecutors, the two local administrations expressed the desire to pay consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
And it would have been the clan - write the judges - to officially to the inside of the councils facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement of public administration " 
The regional chairman of the committee Germany have been Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that 'collusion between the local committees and organised crime, there are more of a "in its region: there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in other countries where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there is also much politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests of this morning follow those of July, during which the police announced have upright the clan Piromalli. 
At the end of April, the City Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; back in 1991, and always because of conditioning alleged between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a coalition of center-right, after the eldest of May 2006. 
He shouted the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
It Governor-General vice interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing of stitched up for a political issue, but given the request of incarceration signed this morning, the judges found that the clan Piromalli had even manages to ask the variation of the A3. 
The interceptions orderly against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is tip "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, a representative of a group known, Piromalli, unifying the choices of the public administration the interests of the clan. 
When energy grows out of the waves, now the big head. 
This is a huge source wilfully occupies more than 70% of the large size of the planet and now the world's largest energy companies are in the process of discovering. 
Waves, currents, tides, the new renewable sources on which behemoths as Chevron have the eyes, and now are trying to put the hand. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea is studied since now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in competition with the first oil crisis, the research have intensified. 
When the price of oil declined, 1980, the idea to exploit the energy marine was sidelined, but now the environmental bodies and the new increase oil offers a strong growth sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) London ruled in 2007 that 15% of the world need electricity could be covered by systems of exploitation of the choppy seas. 
This would be twice the size that produce the nuclear plants. 
In addition, there is the currents and the tides. 
Behemoths to the attack. 
The first to focus on energy marine energy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, a true not revolutionary. 
Two years ago, always more candidates among these companies will always to traditional energy rely on the marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the fact on the energy technologies - said the spokesperson for the company associated with the oil colossus, the business daily Wall Street Journal - and it assesses the opportunities to cooperate with us". 
The cooperation in question, with a permit deliberate by the American committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a project of exploitation of the marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who travel the path of the energy from the sea, and the investments until today, although their details are known, observers believe a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to put to point. 
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, of the fact that the marine energy dispelling fears about the environmental impact. 
At present, the systems such as those of Portugal, or in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create big problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce the large-scale energy, however, we must use technologies with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys linked together. 
The waves, which altered the sludge to the top and the bottom, is converted into a hydraulic pressure pistons and its cylinders inside the cork. 
The pressure to turn a turbine which, in turn, leads to a generator. 
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this type of project, in the hope of a single federal approval and a part of energy could be used in a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces Energy for a commercial center and a parking using six turbines in marine of the East River in New York. 
The movement of water at, runs the pales turbines, creating a rotational movement, which leads to a generator. 
Verdant has announced a long list of clients awaiting permits needed to draw of energy. 
After waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for research of electricity, at the moment, the potential spills. 
Although it is a phenomenon intermittent, the tide is more predictable of wind, solar, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, to look at the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
