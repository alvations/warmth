That is it that it is going to happen? CSSD not connait nor Voldemort nor of cake shop in Prague.
The new elected representatives of CSSD at the town hall of the capital will apparently have to surmount a real linguistic fence to understand themselves as regards the town council with their old and new collegues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "has tested" the new members of the town council belonging to CSSD, that is to say if they experience the argôt that has been born in the course of the dernieres years to the town hall, when it was the partners of the present coalition that directed to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague has set up in the course of the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is not with surprise that it has been discovered that the new elected representatives do not understand trés well the well-known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I do really not know."
"I am a jeunôt in the pragoise policy has reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected representative to the culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather."
And for what concerns the political veteran, the elected representative Karel Brezina has reacted in the same way.
For example the sense of "hole of golf."
"It is the only expression that I use among those that you propose me"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Of the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz has published the expressions in June of this year before the congrés pre éectoral of the ODS, the writing has chosen 6 examples, first those that are related with the town hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the sense of "Voldemort," "the greatest hole of golf to Prague,"aller to the patisserie," "nerve of ox," "treachery of the capital" and "rip off."
Three of the elected representatives have been agreed for the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, which must direct the education to Prague in the future - has promised first and foremost a maintenance but afterwards has not given up the telephone.
The fifth elected representative Petr Dolinek downright has refused the test.
"I do not take care at all of these things there and how enjoy the representatives of the citizen democracy: I will not give my opinion."
"I take care presently of the way of which we are going to understand ourselves within the framework of our programs," has you him reacted.
As one has already heard it, the elected representative Lukas Kaucky would not recognize apparently in the legend above, that it was a matter of the influential one Janousek on the contractors and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not say anything "á'Kaucky and the only expression that he has guessed in the test is" him more great hole of golf in Prague."
"It is a matter of the tunnel Blanka" says Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I am going to have to pay a lesson of language to myself," jokes you him.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy,l'élu for the environment, know that the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two ones social-democratic know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place to find the character - he thinks about the sense of "to go to the cake shop."
"It is a matter, I think, of going to a firm," Plachy is a loan of guessing that it is a matter of the seat of the societies of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina reminds that it gets out his knowledge rather of the newspapers and not of an indifferent vocabulary that it would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is not any lexicon of argôt in the social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we do really not have something of this type."
"One tells rather the names to itself some time one uses of the abbreviations and of the symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the socio-democratic Party, which the members of the Party call Hulda.
"One called me Briza to the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, confesses to Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The Present daily. cz has tested the name and that walk.
The elected representative Weinert is a Granddad for the members of the Party or well the less friendly Small old person, representing it Miroslav Poche, who has attracted the attention on it before the elections by the swindles during the sponsoring of the party, is nicknamed "the small toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones that admit to use inside the party the ones social-democratic.
It seems that Hulinsky does not love to hear much Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this pragois president.
"Doctor in right of club" reminds it seems that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title of doctor in right JUDr.à the academy from police of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of the "witches," has edited a booklet.
In Burkina Faso, the women declared witches have common features.
They are part rather of the old generation, can not work for example for reasons of health, are free and do not have child.
That who becomes "witch" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man very seldom has this fate."
"Neither one does not judge the young women in good health because they participate in the work and give birth to the children," declares a sister who takes care of this country of western Africa, Burkina Faso, in the capital in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been thrown back by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure."
He has edited a booklet that should help has to limit the witch-hunt.
The business comprises a "hic."
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso does not know to read," has warned the daily Die Standard about the drawback of the written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is ordinary in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years has died after having been tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprayed it.
It is the waiter of the BBC that has transmitted this information.
The criminals maintain that it was a matter of the bad eye.
According to their version the oil who is used to the ritual unctions is itself emflammée to the contact of the woman.
The oil has burned, it adorned, while the team has wanted to "drive away the bad mind" from the woman.
The insulation of the "witches" is approved of by the people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human minds always have represented a danger," says him.
Even though Burkina Faso endeavors to reduce the witch-hunt, Gambia not more late that the last year even has seen the President himself to participate in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch-hunt that, it adorned, would have participated in his death and would have endeavored by the black magic to kill also the President."
"Of the shamans of the nearby Guinea come to the aid, have brought to the presidential farmhouse to Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and of the personal guard of the President, of the men and of the women chosen by chance dansdes villages of Gambia," has indicated in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
At the farmhouse the imprisoned people had to drink a potion at base of plants to the hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects in plus on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived it.
On the international pressure it is a thousand people that were replaced at liberty about.
The tenant of Bakal: The poèles warm up, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing aged man has gone out by the door of the customers center of the society RPG Byty of the "baron of the coal" Zdenek Bakal, the greatest owner deprived of apartments for rent in Czech Republic.
It carried a file under the arm with three new contracts of rent for three apartments: hers, that of his girl and of his son who is spirit of purging a grief.
The deregulation has made the rent to these three people increase.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from the year neighbor for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is not warm water and the heating works to the solid fuel," watch of the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power of signature.
"But I have signed nevertheless" explains you him to motié in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of the apartments BytyOKD.cz that has described the nouelles conditions of rent as "immoral and indecent," recommends to the tenants not to sign and to wait until December 7th, date to which will be published some instructions to explain the method to follow to ask.
But the man reacts thereto by a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other one says something else" frowning.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of the deregulation.
After the New Year, it is what waits for the majority of the apartment in Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the price of the market.
Aktualne.cz has as this reason determined of visiting the "laboratory" personally.
The waiting room of RPG in the street Havirovska is one of the four of the region of Ostrava and it is already full on the Tuesday at 09 hours of the morning.
Just beside the door stands a guard of a society of safety with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the tactile screen.
Only one pressure and a paper with a fate number of the device.
You do not have time of reading your number "157" that your number begins already to light up on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of second it is your turn.
After a court instant,un old couple arrives to inform itself about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people has come to settle ordinary problems as everywhere - request of repairings, events regarding the assurances and other.
In the region of Ostrava, the people of more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG recoivent the mails with the new contracts of lease in limps them to the letters for about the mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes them increases of rent of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for the new rents is open to the public since November 18th.
"it works for close to a week, it is therefore still on trial" replies, after an instant of hesitation, the employee behind the window while the customer appears as journalist.
The déragulation and the old apartments of minors of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and originating from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the ones social-democratic of it has made state in way enough supported before the elections and that fills henceforth the newspapers places.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They have not changed me even one could... not of board in the wc, relieves in introduction the mentioned man.
However, they are especially pensioners who come to be sure about their receiving a discount on the new price of the rent if they sign now as RPG has promised it in a special offer, according to the employees.
It is a discount of the half of the amount of the rent that the other loctaires will receive that will have signed their new contract before December 15th.
But the window "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is not overwhelmed really by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who have come yesterday, only 40 to 50 have come for the rent," indicates the employee to the window.
And nevertheless RPG porpose on his web site as well as in the windows of the individual maintenances on the rents while it is necessary.
If the two parts do not hear themselves on the rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'It is not a matter of threats but only of informing about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally," indicates RPG on his web site.
"Here nobody will go to the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the center of customers it give reason.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and he remains me 5000 crowns to eat, I do not have enough to go to the court," says him.
The employee feels suddenly badly comfortably.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that nobody signs and therefore the people wait," indicates you it.
The regulation of the rents ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And furthermore, the present rents do not reach always the necessary level for the simple maintenance of the fund for the accommodations," reminds Pavel Klimes, manager of the smart portfolio of the society RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for the accommodations that makes the tenant in anger is the main reason of the increase of the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG has been able with the rents to invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 has 2014 that should make 5.2 billion.
The big screen hooked on the ceiling opposite the armchairs padded from the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, repeats however some information indicated in red.
'The increase of the rent in 2011 is of 15 percent and does not concern less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG'.
"And it will be always to the more 7.50 Czech crowns the m² by month," indicates the screen.
The increase of 38 percent concerns only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases there, it is a matter of an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns to the m²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same one for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the increase of the rents (cf. the graph) is given back to the apartments under the form of economics of heating - news windows and heating.
Those that sign the agreement on the increase of rent have the priority.
The nursery school is part, it also, offices have included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new seat of the society Arch. Design.
Nobody would have been able to expect that it shelters also a mini nursery school with all what is needed - walls of colors, of the imaginative furniture, of the toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, can go there the children of the employees of Arch. design.
The society of projects-architectonics Arch. Design. of which the workrooms have produced a great number of buildings to Brno, has imagined his mini nursery school of firm from the first outlines of the building Avriopoint.
She uses about 90 people, especially of the age to make children and it cared about it that the women architects and leaders of projects rapidly can come back to the work.
At the same time as of the work contracts in time weak, the nursery school is a bonus proposed to his employees by the society Arch. Design. within the framework of his social program.
The builders and the architects have thus the possibility of combining a taking work with the care for the children.
It is the employees of Arch. Design. themselves that have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they have been able to obtain an endowment of the European Union and of the Ministry from the work and from the social businesses.
The mini nursery school is financed by the means of the European Social Fund through the operational program of the human resources and of the state Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the endowments of financing (to height of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They have been able to buy equipment both of the devices and after two years to assure a qualified staff as the start.
After the use of the endowment of financing (two years) the society Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years of making the mini nursery school work on his own funds.
The preparation of the project has lasted a year and it is the Economy rating society that has helped the request of endowment to make.
The care to the children is assured by a qualified staff, the whole day a nurse and a teacher of nursery school take care of the children. the children can go to the nursery school without limitation of age but they have more than three anspour the majority.
As it is a matter of one " mini nursery school" it can not be only 5 present children at the same time, but in the course of the day there are more that are replaced.
The working of the school is supple according to the needs of the parents and the children of all the employees have the same right to use this school without glance on the hierarchical position.
Well that him him agise of a care and an education individual, the program of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for the preschool education.
The children do not make that to play but an education of quality also is assured - of the beginning up to the preparation to the benches of school one teaches the English.
The class is equipped not only with toys and imaginative games but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of the small children in the society creates a friendly and positive environment.
The parents can at any moment to control their child and not to have the stress of a delay to go to look for the children in a school far from the workplace of the parents.
The parents use therefore their time of work of the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch. Design. thus has noted down itself among the societies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of the RH.
The house in bone fascinates still after 100 years. Throw an eye to the insides of Gaudi.
The toît looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the stairs at a backbone of dinosaur and the balconies at open mouths of fish.
It is as the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Because of his organic forms, the house has received the nickname of House on behalf of the places in bone.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, front reminding scales and everywhere present of the curves, this is all what is ypique for the art nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal front of the house unfolds his lines of dream, his colors and pleasant textures that remind the nature and the animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the front of the house becomes still more dramatic and is crazy so that the impression of brilliance of the colors is reinforced.
The rolling-up and the twisting of the forms appears also in the insides with the same measure.
The wood copies the frames of windows, the parapets, the decorative elements of the doors, the peephole and the slivers in waves.
The house Battlo that rises up in the area Eixample in the market street Passeig of Gracia to the number. 43, has been born of the building of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction has made to itself for two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich contractor, first has stressed the demolition of the vieile building and the building of another very new but accepted rapidly the idea of Gaudi of an unusual reconstruction and of better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as house to numerous accommodations was not thought by lonely Gaudi.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with it.
It is precisely on his project that people have been born the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the front.
For the front also have worked of other artists and creative.
The common work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo has begun by a cooperation at succés between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol has participated in the building of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and of the park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The places have nicknamed the fair house live after his finishing because of his organic forms "the House in bone."
Of other, had consideration to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows have called it "the house that gives."
One tells that at the top of the building there is a similar sword to that of Saint Georges the boss of the Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the building contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi has thought a unique system for the house in his time of heating central,avec of the blowholes of aeration and of the typical chimneys.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems strange.
In the course of the creation Gaudi has not respected absolutely the directives of building of then and has not let itself hinder by them.
At the beginning of the building it has obtained on behalf of the city the planning permission, knowing, of course that the data carried on the plans of reconstruction were so vague that two years after during the finishing the town council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It did not please, for example, the members of the town council only the pillars of the empiettent building on the public sidewalk.
Modification was never, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for the authorization of praising the two higher stories.
The owner moved at the inferior stories.
In the gallery to the second story there was a lounge common and to the third a bedroom and a part deprived of the apartment.
The first floor was rented at a jewellery.
The whole house of six stories is shared by some stairs by which one reaches up to a terrace of independent toît.
All the right corners and the straight lines were canceled by the elements of base of the reconstruction and their substitution by curved walls.
Gaudi worked also the modern concept of link of the spaces.
The common part can be connected completely embroidering the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or well to be limited the space deprived for more personal maintenances.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received beside new fronts a not traditional toîture and two stories in more.
The game of Gaudi with the light is also impressing, of the blue and white glass tiles with which the interior court is decorated and with the wells of lights.
The game to two colors gives a maximum of light in all the stories of the house.
It sufficed simply to bet on the principle that the reflête white more that sinks it that on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Casa Battlo that has been noted down in 2005 in the Fund of the Patrimony Mondial de l'Unesco maybe visited by each.
To the first story of the house finds itself the apartment the most spacious and the most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners have decided of overcoming it not in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the birth of the famous creator.
They have continued the visits because they have noticed that it is a matter of a lucrative firm and they have broadened the field of the visits at the common spaces and at the attic including the terraces of toît.
The ticket of entry in the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros; the students, the pensioners, the groups and the possessors of touristic cards have 20 percent of discount.
Nevertheless the sum is above the price of entry in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with his fantastic turrets, you must rapidly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a base: the women have other criteria that the men.
Not of ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the reserved surface to the to lay down, therefore the mattress and the base give a real base for a good bed.
They must be completed of course harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are déterminantes,:le weight, the size, the age, the state of health as the sex of the owner.
The type of inside in which one is going to put the mattress and the base is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house that one does not sleep continuously the mattresses in latex are not appropriated because they "warm up" sweetly.
They have, moreover, a weight superior to the mattresses in polyurethane switchboards.
Turning them over frequently is necessary.
If they do not have also enough canals of ventilation at the heart and if they remain, besides, on a solid board, they keep the dampness. Mildew can also form.
The habit is as decisive in the choice.
That who passes the light of the time abroad that one uses frequently very thick mattresses with a rammollissante coat, will feel in a difficult way well on a low surface and lasts.
"It is thus that all the hokeyistes that come back of NHL are complained itself that they can not sleep over there."
"For their tired shoulders, the feet and the coasts, they needed mattress with a rammollisante coat of lazy person foam."
"Such mattresses also are recommended for the people who suffer from diabetes who have a confusion of the nervous system that therefore accept pains "the information" in the articulations and in the skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova that specializes in the stuffed furniture.
It is for that that the mattress with lazy foam has conquered the hokeyistes as other customers some years ago.
"Today everything walks well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example of the appropriate mattresses.
You do not need to be a lad of NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes his rigidity and his form according to the absorbed heat or well adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing makes pressure on you and you will not turn you over in the night as after a difficult match.
You simply sleep better.
The lazy foam works also as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180 cm need therefore a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimal width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm is 180 cm in all.
For the beds only to one place, the singles for example, it is recommended of taking at least 120 /140 cm.
It is a chest of drawers in the event of visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: while you are laid down piggyback you should put the hands in a comfortable way with the lightly flexed elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Saddlers-mattress makers and decorators who devotes herself for several years to the problems of a healthy sleep and to the ergonomics of the furniture and teaches it in the specialized schools.
For a bed to two places each needs his own base and mattress, therefore attention however during the achât of well choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise he will remain you only to go up the base to different heights and that is not attainable on all the frames of bed.
The mattresses foam should have a minimal height of 14 cm, the inner spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of that count for the coat of form and of aeration at least three centimeters.
"To the to touch or in position established on the mattress you must not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Every mattress requires a type well determined from base.
The bed-base, when the mattress and the base are united as siamoises sisters, does not have anything to make in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are aired very badly; one must not wash it, what makes auhourd'hui to itself ordinarily.
And since for the night one sweats in a normal way of 0.2 to 0.75 the of sweat it is light that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts reminding a great (and overcast) sieve.
For that the specialists refuse to make publicity towards a duration of life of 25 years for a mattress or of a guarantee for life.
But all to her but.
And for that an advice of experience on behalf of the salesmen: for a mattress of 120/140 cm, renounce, for the coating of the mattress, the hygiene or the washing but add rather a mattress of protection than vouspouvez easily to withdraw and to wash.
And even so nowadays producing coatings with closing to slide channel for the whole unity, that is to say after the opening one has two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!), is frequent otherwise the handling for the great models (and only for one person) becomes when one withdraws them a fighting between a light weight and a heavy truck on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a base?
Never!
To the maximum for a bed intended to the visitors only for one night.
However equip the board (if there is not some) with airholes and use the inner spring mattress with a minimal height of 15 cm with springs in packets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a coat of aeration.
A mattress in polyurethane must not be part of a bed of this type.
For the bases to slivers to unique position with 14/18 slivers, the mattresses in latex or said sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and of coconut), are the ideal but it will be always better for you to have a mattress with more slivers, 28 and above, where the slivers are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and that it thus is possible to control the rigidity.
For the mattresses to several positions one must not set from inner spring mattress because it does not reply to the changes of position.
Beside the adjustment of the rigidity of the slivers one can install also what one calls a cradle of shoulder.
It is a matter of a special link of the slivers that allows making pressure indeed bending the sliver so that the shoulder of the sleeper is integrated well.
For the men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by the manufacturers of mattress that for the "male" ones have started using a rammollissante zone at the level of the shoulders.
But they think also about the women - they offer them again a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are bases at wings or at plates with what one calls a multistrength suspension.
The pressure is scattered in plus of points and diinue the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated of air) on good mattresses and base, the most disparait.
The rule of base is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and his points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recorded size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
While one is lengthened on the side, the pillow must put at level (with the cradle of shoulder of the base or the rammollie zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have still something common with the first at base of straw and of herbs.
The manufacturers use still natural matters or many mixtures.
The tendency is also to the mattress bio.
The raw materials at base of pétrôle, from which one produces the polyurethane, are replaced with natural oils, as for example oil of soybean.
Nearly all the well-known manufacturers use precisely the soybean.
"The qualifier Bio for the mattresses means that the heart is produced to base of natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the society Tropico Plus.
The natural matters are used also for the coatings of the mattresses; one of the first has been the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or of lavender to it.
There are differences between the man and the woman.
Even though extracts it of plants of birch so that the coating of the mattress absorbs the heat and cools down the body, "cools down" the man, the coatings "warm up" the women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the fiery circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The present favorites?
The mattresses produced from cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure disrupted therefore more breathing than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where finds itself the head, the lower back and the feet.
You will pay a mattress of quality from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their parameters for the health have less VATS and they are busy than of the instruments for the health.
In Czech Republic, it is Gumotex that has reached the first place.
To save for the mattress and the base is not simple.
From time to time one can have within the framework of special actions on behalf of the manufacturers or of the producers two mattress for the price only of one.
As for example the society Magniflex that proposes mattresses Duofreeze with foam to memory Memory sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
One can evidently take the second for free.
The era of the lazy person foams or viscoélastiques with an open cellular structure and a great thickness has been started up with the matter Tempur to a "cosmic" rhythm.
That has begun as matter for NASA parceque the astronauts underwent to the start enormous factors of load.
The Tempur him rammollit to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It adapts therefore to the warm human body perfectly and distributes an optimal pressure to him.
It is an ideal for that against the slept harm and for an increase of comfort during the sleep.
The viscoélastiques foams are used not only for the mattresses but also for the products for the health, as the special cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
The Czech manufacturers use for example the foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The devices to follow the people are asked for more and more by the parents who want to watch their children.
The fear for their child leads more and more people to think of watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up initially to search for the cars can tout aussi well to be used to draw the movement of the people and to help for some cases as by exmple that of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is presently as big that one is shaky of matches but will be soon size of one watch.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a great number of people and they have started looking for the means of better protecting their children.
Even if the price is of disturbing their private life.
"We endeavor to tell everyone that it is not a matter of espionage but only of another means to reduce the probability that it has as it another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the society MAcro Weil that is one of the purveyors of devices of marking on the market Czech.
"I confess that there can be cases of bad job such devices, as for example putting it in the bag of a person that does not know, but yet I have not met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for reasons of safety, adds Pilin.
According to it the children always should know at what ends is used "limps it" and how to use it in the event of urgency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not have desire of dealing with it a thing of it brings out the features for, him him in débarassera.
'And even the smallest can show a great creativity when it is a matter of disposing on purpose of something while they do not want to be under control'.
"The portable telephones, which can isolate as these devices from marking, already have led to the parents long expectations," asserts Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of agression is very debatable.
"If it is a matter of a prepared abduction, the author is going to make everything so that the child does not have electronic device that can localize it."
"Presently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as the equipment of marking is going to develop, them (the criminals) are going to look them them also because the sale will be supported by a campaign of advertisement."
"In such cases the criminals will be always early on the police," suggests the psychologist.
She confesses to everything as such devices can help during an agression not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC society Monitoring, which proposes services of marking for the cars as well as for the people, asserts only of having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an agression.
"The device can be parametrized in such a way that it is in regular emission after a determined period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains all the same the last position of the concerned person."
'The more expensive devices have also an inclinometer that signals immediately the position of the person who has slipped and finds herself in position lengthened without moving', indicates Cech.
According to it tell them portables called intelligent that are equipped with a system of navigation, can propose a comparable service after him to have formatted with a prosoftware special.
The problem of the present systems of marking is that it is a matter is of a device fellow man to those that one carries size of one in pendant limps of matches is to the smallest telephonic devices.
One can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the society Macro Weil, it is why of the tests are led presently to make devices that look like common numeric watches.
"That will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not be able to recognize the device of marking."
"Or well he will realize it after some time, what will have given a bit more time to the police," it adds.
That the device of marking is developed under the form of bracelet or of pendant, him utilisiera always the same technology that to draw cars.
It is a matter of a combination of systems of acquisition of a position by means of the GPS (which is used ordinarily in selfnavigation) and of a duty of a portable telephone that alerts the present position of a vehicle.
The army has so many explosive lines that it could go round of the Czech Republic with. But it can keep only two years.
The army has bought for 445 km of lines used for the explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km.
The army has therefore reserves as 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of life of the lines is of two to four years maximum.
The army has bought explosive lines to the limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff has given as reason achât of an enormous quantity of explosive lines to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per annum.
According to the calculations of reserve to hold made by the pyrotechnists of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it emerges from it that even the generals, the officers having a command, secretaries or well the staff of household should have every year an exercise to the explosives.
Commanding Alexandre Vondra, Minister of the defense and Vlastimil Picek, of the army do not make exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of explosive lines.
To this distance corresponds 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reserves of the army could provide for it for 10 years.
So on the contrary it would be true that for the entrainement of base of each of the new professionals it suffices to the more than 2 m of explosive lines, as the experts say it, that means that the army with his new purchase has assured - also with the consumption of the special unity and of the genius - reserves for the 225 mentioned years.
Nevertheless the soldiers of the squad of fast intervention have lately complained to the Minister Vondra that they do not have ammunitions nearly as their weapons of fist and that the sessions of shooting are limited because of the needs of money.
About the lack of underwear one does not speak some.
"And I do not consider the head if they buy at our places a so great quantity of explosive lines."
"And it is their decision and they know really what they make."
"for us the army is a good customer that we endeavor as storekeepers to satisfy," says the business manager of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of the defense, argues the achât of hundreds of km of explosive lines by the fact that the army will have these "ammunitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group states however of only four years of duration of life of the explosive lines and the pyrotechnists of the police and of the army only of two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, that can go even until four years," says one two that does not want that his name is published had consideration to the criticism of the army.
The past deadline of duration of life, every ammunition must be tested to see if it remains honest and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not however free and cost still money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount owed to the quantity for 445 km of explosive cordeux.
"They have cost 60 percent of less than the supply of the past year of 245 km, to us" indicates the spokesperson Pejsek that is made the interpreter of the opinion of the purchasers of the ministry of the defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the explosive lines of the pyrotechnists of the police who neutralize the ammunitions of the second world war or well those after the Soviet army, does not overtake the 1500 meters.
And the police order always only the necessary quantity of ammunitions to be used before the end of their duration of life.
That has been established for reasons of safety of the pyrotechnists both besides to be able to obtain more supple way from the types of more modern explosive lines and more reliable.
the ministry of the defense has today big problems as the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunitions coming from the time of the Pact of Warsaw when the Czech army strong of two hundred thousand men got ready for moving, cape on the Rhine.
What waits in some years for this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometers of old explosive lines that she buys today "at good market."
Up to today I pull benefit of contacts that I have obtained thanks to the competitions.
The sale under frankness of his hotel has well helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the competition of the best individual Contractor.
The winner of the competition of the best individual Contractor for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor of 28 years.
His adventure to the succés is as in a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he has realized that to Libérec he missed a site of lodging of quality to a reasonable price.
From his economics on what it had won while he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he has bought a small half demolished building of 5 apartments.
Knowing that it was still studying in trosième year of superior studies, it was a brave action.
"The relation between the quality and the price of a lodging in our region has given me desire of making something," says Lucas Pytloun.
It began has to praise the first reconstructed apartment to the foreign workers.
It re-invests the profit in the building that it transformed into pension with 54 beds.
From that moment, his action of contractor has allowed to him to open pensions to Libérec 4, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of lodging.
The most comfortable of them was up to everything lately the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it another of identical quality has happened to him.
"We have signed just a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U Tise where we have sold our concept of frankness and of other candidates at the frankness of the hotels Pytloun he are shown," the number 1 of the contractors of the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the bet in working of a hotel on a large scale the victory to the competition of the contractor of the year has well served, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory has brought more popularity to him and of being known to Libérec and his surroundings.
"The people recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," it reminds.
It recommends the participation in this competition to all those that endeavor to make something.
Winning is not necessary but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that it uses up to today his contacts and knowledge that it would not have been able to obtain from another way.
"With those that I have met thanks to the competition I have started maintaining commercial relationships regularly.
According to it, the fame related to the succés has had an impact also on the employees.
And it has 70 about.
"I observe at their places especially the loyalty and the pride of having started in something that has in general been recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us everyone unity.
"Only my name is moved forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one that we have had at Farmet.
The euphory of the victory has been rpidement replaced with the effects of the crisis.
Grace in the sense of the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind itself.
The one that has come to look for the prize for Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by last Vodaphone the year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the society Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed into a firm to the turnover of 100 million crowns a workroom of tools in Ceska Skalice.
'I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me my also my colleagues and has increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition," declares today the winner of the competition of the last year.
At the beginning of the history of the society Farmet there was the desire of making something of useful.
And thus when the state has offered to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workroom as compensation after the confiscation for the goods by the communists, he has not hesitated long, has refused a career in a firm where he worked at that time, and has created a society with some friends in the environment of his father for the fabrication of bathtubs in plastics.
Not very long after they have started specializing in the presses for vegetable oil.
He has become after eighteen years the greatest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
The society has been known even in the public not specialized after the succés obtained to the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have begun to experience really better the brand Farmet but also the foreign partners that have started realizing that they collaborated with a society that has obtained the greatest succés in his country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year n'e has not passed itself to Farmet only ldans the euphory of the victory.
The evaluation of the society had been made from the economic results of 2008 and in part of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machines of engineering.
At the highest of the crisis, which has really not touched the citizens, the societies were obliged to stop their projects of investments and to start limiting their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We have not escaped this situation evidently."
"The turnovers have fallen of 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even to dismiss," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they have managed the situation correctly and have preserved bénéficiares results even if they were inferior to those that they had before the crisis.
However at Farmet, they have kept on without compromise investing in the research and the development.
"We have built with the endowments a training center and of research, have reinforced the presentation of the society in international lounges-exhibitions and won the main rewards in the national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affires go back and with them numbers it of used also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a quiet atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The inquiry that removes insane regulations.
The inquiry on the Absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the clan of the businesses.
Some absurd règlementations have can to be removed.
The little glorious winner of this year of the inquiry on the Absurdity of the year has been the obligation to bring in the offices documents that the officials can obtain on-line.
More of the third of the 4000 voters have voted for that.
For example, the administrations of the social businesses asked a paper extract of the register of the business even though the official can obtain it in two clics from mouse.
that changes thanks to the inquiry.
"The Czech administration of the social assurance will not ask for the extract of the register of the business anymore for the controls of payments of the assurance," has indicated Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Administration of the social assurance (CSSZ).
To make go out again all the regulations and decrees that the societies and the contractors must fill Czech in Republic and to make those that are absurd remove is the sense of this competition of the Absurdity of the year.
This inquiry is still this year for the fourth time a part of the clan of the businesses organized by Hospodarske noviny and has still a greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters have appeared, they are at least 4000 this year that have brought their voice.
And it is not astonishing, him ya in our country the most diverse legal obligations that make only to slow down the firm, et,ce, more and more.
"We are maybe to the number of documents to fill" "for the fiscal declarations to the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek de l'Association of the small ones and attracted averages and of the contractors of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the activity of contractor becomes a goal declared of all the governments these last years.
In comparison with the whole world the situation in Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the world bank the Czech Republic is located to the 74 ème place for what concerns the conditions for the firm, or 8 places more in relation to the last year.
The competition of the Absurdity of the year has been set up for the first time in 2006 and continues every year according to the same script.
Anybody can state every year of the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to thin September, last deadline before the fence of the competition.
To give back counts him ya the web site www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition chooses seven candidates for "the antiprice" and lets the public vote for the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the greatest number of voice is declared victorious.
Up to the last inquiry of the last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrêts that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by the contractors but also the professional unions and the teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees finds itself for example the obligation that the vehicles of maintenance of the motorways and of the expressways pay the tolls, or although the contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two bathrooms every two years.
the list of the seven suggestions is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins always at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a happening to which partake regularly of the personalities of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, manager of the Association for the small ones and average firms of Czech Republic or well Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, have attended the towering moment of the competition.
'The economic prosperity can not work when the State puts âtons in the legs of the contractors and for that my objective is of removing, every year, at least thirty from paragraphs that today do not make what to complicate the firm," to declared Martin Kocourek, the Minister of the industry and of the business.
The effort to remove absurd from the decrêts is not a blow of sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please the people was the obligation of the contractors to declare three days before at the office for the individual firm at the place that the firm, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pélerinage with a stand, is.
This obligation was removed with the ammendement from the Law on the individual firm.
The second obligation most elected by plebiscite in 2007, which was of to declare to the Office work a journey on duty for a foreign employee towards 30 days, has been removed with the bill on what one calls the card green.
And everything is ok up to the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 has been the decrêt for the physiotherapists of having a great mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two shop scales.
That has been changed by prescription from the ministry of the health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards the responsible firms socially.
The ecological, humanitarian projects, of training or still sportsmen, are evaluated.
The novelty of this year of the competition of Hospodarske Noviny, who exists already for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support to the reasonable and fair firm.
"We want to support the societies that watch the impacts of their firm on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," indicates Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator of portable telephone, the firm Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, the societies that do not have succés only with one objective in the long term as the firm have registered themselves.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the object of their firm is different one of the other one one can consider their activity of support and forecasting as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, that concerns the handicapped people and the problems personal or of health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic does not find itself example the society of prologiciels pragoise Et Netera that supports the creation of informal sport teams of their employees who participate afterwards in a number of tournaments in different sport disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the region of Pardubice is the society Isolit-Bravo that is for 17 years the contributeur main one to the fund of endowment that sponsors the handicapped children.
By the way of taking care of the employees having problems of health, one can quote still The old factory of fabrication of paper of Podebrad that uses more than 70 percent and that, for that, has obtained the title from the firm Person in Charge for the region of central Bohemia and who has put third in the region to the competition of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
To Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial society, that has won to have introduced timetables of work loosened and even to have reduced until 35 hours a week on average et,ce, without, proportionellement, reduction of salary.
The jury it déverné the title also because it achête first to the Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the close environment and the environment worries.
"We endeavor to recycle the most possible so that our activity of firm and our administration have the smallest impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive manager of the society.
the responsible society IT Enlogit de l'Région of Usti thinks also to the health of his employees and has put to them in place for every laptop computer an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work from home and uses the services of catering of a local protected factory for his actions.
"We support moreover the foundation The man in the shade that helps the local community Rom," says Ondrej Suchy representing it of the society.
To the very last row feels, also for his activities, a society of Washing and cleanup of the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the retirement assurance of his employees under the form of bonus above the switchboards.
"In our society we contribute to the food, the transport, the increase of the qualifications and to the leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the society of building of bruntal Czasch, winner for the region of Moravia-Silésie.
Were noted down automatically in the Responsible society category, all the regional finalists for the competition of the Firm of the year of Vodaphone, which had replied to the questionnaires in part joined of the document for the registration and had sent back it to the organizer before August 15th.
The badly full or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in lists had not replied to the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified of the "main" competition the Firm of the year of Vodaphone."
"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a matter of a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
To the Fund for the Ground at Plzen, the police have conducted arrests in the course of a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the Ground at Plzen, the anti-corruption police have conducted arrests these last days.
The detectives have passed the handcuffs to the contractor local and trading in immobilier Lubos. G.
This had endeavored to handle precisely a public call of offers for the regulations of a request of return in such a way that the proposed ground is obtained by a determined candidate.
This had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the Moment I can only confirm that the police prosecute a person for offense of initiate within the framework of a call of public offers and concour." has declared for the newspaper Pravo the leader of the Parquet of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is banned to supply more explanations because the inquiry is in process.
The policemen have replaced after 24 hours this contractor of 46 years at liberty.
To know in what way it could influence on a public competition, only one can speculate had consideration to the so little of official information.
To a question of Pravo, the spokesperson of the Fund of the Grounds Lubomira Cerna has indicated that the policemen really had conducted an arrest to Plzen on a separate workplace and, it, in the course of the public competition.
"It has been a matter of a customer and in no case of an employee, it has clarified.
The public competition according to Surrounded has as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of grounds according to the Law on the earth" and is set up while several profitable candidates appear by right.
"These people propose, within the framework of the call, a superior value of their rights to resitutions that must be settled before the value of the ground is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a classification of the purchasers is set up and the Fund of the Grounds transfers afterwards the ground to the person who has proposed the highest rights," has explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information regarding the people who had registered themselves at the call and as it is itself, also, a bénéficiare person because having bought a great number of rights to returns, it had offered to the candidates for the ground not to participate in the competition.
And it cashed no doubt by the fact of retiring.
What would explain why it had so much money in his possession at the moment of his questioning.
Lubos G. largely had contacts above the switchboards at the FdT (Fund of the Grounds).
It appeared in the business of the ex-leader of the FdT Vaclav Sankot that was pursued to the criminal one to have to edit grounds for which already one had edited the decision of arrangement of a building.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example grounds destined for the building from public communications, concretely in place and place where the artery d'accés had to be built to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is superior from a distance.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked to put the building in peril by a blocking of the grounds.
The households are going to pay a supplement of a hundred crowns monthly for the accommodation.
The households will owe from January to pay a supplement not only for all the types of energy but also for the water and the decontamination, the supplies of heating and to some places the rents will increase also.
The families will owe therefore from January to get out of their purse up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
The electricity increases in 4.6 percent, the gas nearly of 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth furthermore the supply of water and in numerous places the supplies of central heating will be as more expensive.
The increase of the electricity should border for the households in apartment the 100 anuellement crowns of more than presently.
However all the purveyors have reduced the prices of the electricity being given the sensitive development to encourage the fabrication of the renewable energies, notably the stacks photovoltaÏques.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the moment where the people need the more to warm up and have therefore the greatest consumption.
One can therefore count also a hundred crowns besides.
Although the electricity and the gas increase Czech in the whole republic, the change in the price of the central heating differs from city downtown.
It is principally the greatest towns that plan the rise in prices.
For example the households to Pardubice or to Hradec Kraloce will pay as from January for the central heating nearly 50 crowns of more by month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague an increase of 9 percent for the water and the decontamination for the case where the city increases the rents of infrastructure gets ready.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The prize for Prague will make still part of the lowest in comparison with the very whole country.
In Bohemia from the north, where the prices are already part of the highest, the water and the decontamination increase in 7.4 percent.
The prices of the rents are going to increase for example noticeably a thousand apartments in the 450 of them in rent from January in other words at the end of the regulation.
For example the society CPI Byty that possesses nearly 2500 apartments at Usti nad Labem, has decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those that will not be with the new increase of the rents will be translated agreed in front of the courts by the society.
The controlled rents that the people pay in nearly 300 a thousand apartments could increase the next year of 10 percent.
The Czech children him saoûlent to the rum and to the fernet. The beer is not fashion anymore and acts very sweetly.
The fernet, the rum, the vodka and in an exceptional way also the best marks of whisky are flown to the parents.
They are drinks that take the most often those that him saoûlent, which does not have still fifteen years, between the hands of the doctor.
The children who are looked after at the hospital for repetition do not make the exception.
That results from the experience of the doctors who meet cases similar to the admissions of the child departments of the hospitals.
"The beers or the wines are not fashion anymore because time is needed to be saoûl."
'The tendency is really to the strong alcohols', indicates for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Leader of the department children of the hospital of Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in pinching a bottle to father in the cupboard, it is a matter of sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with juice of fruit and thus not feel it," explains the Leader of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the hospital Motol, gives him also reason.
"In general, it is rum or fernet."
"It is today the alcohol in fashion notably in the elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has been a matter of slivovice that they have brought back from the house," has added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, to see aged drunk children of thirteen to fourteen years to the admissions to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working on Horovice for the last year, it was in Motol where it exercised ten years precisely in pediatrics where the ambulances took schoolboys from the wide completely drunk surroundings.
"A young girl was hospitalized thus four times
"It acommencé his career at twelve years while it has been brought with 3.5 for a thousand of dansle alcohol blood with besides a mixture with l'extasy,"décrivait the doctor this particularly important case.
"It was Exposures of Holesovice to a party at the Park."
"What is interesting, it is that it did not appear strange to the mother that his girl is absent 48 hours" called surprised the Manager of the Department.
It is precisely the unselfishness of the parents or well their tolerance out of the common one opposite the fact that their offspring devote themselves to the drink that are the main cause of the développment of the alcoholism of the children.
According to the specialists, one does not talk however about the dependence, in his strict sense, for the children.
"Under the alcoholic term one hears a chronic dependence at the alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that follow from it but that one does not find by the children."
"By those that use the acool repeatedly, it is a matter rather of a significantly unfavorable socio-family back-ground," explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunk children have been hospitalized this year up to the mid-November in the clinic of pediatrics to Motol.
The stastistiques are not integrated only the cases with a grâve poisoning requiring the hospitalization.
The drunk children, are not counted who are after the care of urgency brought back to their places by the parents or by the police.
Beside the cases of the children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after the school, him exsite according to seasonal vague Pélikan three that one can reckon with: the day of the witches, the saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Or they drink bad results by vexation after or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the vacations."
"Of course I have lived at the day on the witches an admission of 7 children wild only with one blow," has underlined Pélikan.
The drunk child that has spent the night to the hospital in désintoxciation under control medical is paradoxically in better position than the one that has fit to his place and suffers the day after from the "hangover."
The headaches of the morning caused by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and of nutritive elements that the organism needs.
"They are for that better divided up since they pass an excellent evening then a sweet waking and nothing hurts to them."
"Only they are surprised of the place where they are," adds knowing Pélikan that from time to time that wastes the good mood of the patients at least with the bill to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied that as a means of education counting to these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to reimburse only one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to it, the insurance companies of health in their managements in regression, which should recover the loads related to the care on behalf of the parents, do not treat the cases of drunk children.
Two airplanes L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two had L-159 of the five in all, against which the Ministry of Defense has exchanged airplanes of transport Casa It 295 M, have taken off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer sits from airplanes Casa-EADS.
It is the first time that devices of this type become the property of somebody of Czech other than the army.
They have nevertheless been abroad within the framework of exercises or of flights of demonstration.
It is a matter of the biplace versions of the L-159T1 that were until now Czech in operation in the army and that were in a state of flight.
Lestrois remaining devices are one-seater versions of the L-159.
These are parked for the moment at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - has taken into account them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the department of press of the Ministry of the defense, the physical departure of the airplanes of Vodochody is for the moment unknown.
'The airplanes L-159 one-seaters foreseen for the exchange have been taken on airplanes stocked for long without that not causing loads or additional investments for the Ministry of the defense'.
"The biplaces L-159 T1 have exchanged in the state," has declared for Pravo Pejsek.
He has jousted that the army will not remain without two-seater since the ministry has signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused one-seaters L-159 in two biplaces.
The army has taken delivery of the first device in July, the second being foreseen to the delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing the airplanes into the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clearly advisable that the one that takes into account the airplanes L-159 is EADS and that they will serve pilots of member countries of the NATO at the entrainement."
"Consequently it is the business of the one that takes into account to determine how to realize that," it has indicated Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested by the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for an airplane Put and the purchase of three other airplanes for 3.5 billion crowns has been ratified the last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The ministry of the defense has not launched call from offers and has contacted EADS directly.
the direction of the defense argued even though the exchange insures a future exportation of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought Aéro Vodochody 72 devices and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of airplanes Put will have probably of the judicial involvements.
the European Commission nevertheless has lodged a complaint against the Czech ministry of the defense next to the European Court of Justice because had them have owed not to be chosen within the framework of a call of offers to the European ladder and in any case contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army already has taken delivery of three airplanes Put, the latter should arrive on the airport of Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular one is a sign of weak risk of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the annular one are exposed to a lesser risk of having a cancer of the prostate.
It is the amazing conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
That can depend on the level of the male hormone the testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as simple test of risk of cancer of the prostate, notably for the men before 60 ans,"a proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, teacher to the Institute for the research on the cancer to the university of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine what men should subject themselves to the test of the cancer of the prostate, combining notably with the genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors as the antécedents of health familiaux,a added Eeles.
For the period of 1994-2009 her has follow-up with his colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patient affected of a cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants to the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular one.
For them as for the 19 percent of those that had the fingers of the same length, one has found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those that had the index longer than the annular one the risk has however fallen at 33 percent, for the men before 60 years the reduction of the risk has affected 87 percent.
The relation of length of the two fingers quoted - formed for the prenatal period - indicates notably levels different from sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the uterus.
Except testosterone a longer index corresponds.
Previous investigations had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that helps in the development of a cancer of the prostate.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, famous Czech geneticist and previous president of the Academy of the sciences, has said for CTK that he knows of this study but that it does not seem it, it adorned, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is completely demonstrated.
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by the snow.
On the roads and the sidewalks, there is most of the time of the dense snow, the déblayeurs have worked all night in many places.
The motorway D5 is closed the morning between the 89th and the 93rd marks with milestones towards Rozvadov because of several accidents of trucks and of cars and the auroute D1 to Brno towards Prague sudden the same fate.
To dispatch it of the Automobile central club (UAMK) has said it to the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck has been damaged, to the 93rd two heavy trucks are struck into themselves, the accident has made casualties.
Several cars have found themselves also in the ditch.
The problems are also on the motorway D1 to the 185 ème kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks are struck into themselves
The drivers should just go out after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go by Brno and enter afterwards at Kyvalka at the 182nd kilometer.
A line of cars of several kilometers has formed at this place.
Also on the motorway D11, there is an accident and, it, just to the arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a coat of snow of several centimeters of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example at Prosek, the street Sterboholska is as overcast.
The surest means of transport is the subway.
The streetcars fall behind for example on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of the peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours of the morning the staff of crisis of Prague must still meet.
The railroad tracks and the airport meet also problems.
The Czech Railroads have already had to remove links because of the snow 7 from expresses.
The lines for example of Prague to Kralupy or well of Prague to Beroun have of the problems
The travellers should control the present situation.
The airport of Ruzyne has been closed since Wednesday 11h00 in the night until 5 hours of the morning.
Most of the roads in Moravia of the South are already roulable but redoubling vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno there start being gusts of snow by places and on the road of Blansko the chaines are compulsory to pass some ways of communications in the places placed more top.
The region of Vyskov has been part of the most touched places.
Until now are closed the axes: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it will be needed maybe to send of the dissnowy ones and strawberries to snow.
One can for the moment not value when they will be roulables.
On the road of Hodonin the caution is of rigor in the region of the white Carpathes.
On the roads that are, had consideration to the protection of the nature, kept only by the spraying of inert products, there is a coat of 5 centimeters of snow all the same warns CTK.
In Czech Republic, it has fallen between two at 10 centimeters of snow; he has beaten the most in Bohemia of the north, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silésie, it has fallen up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The disparait snow coverage in Czech Republic progressively.
The American ones have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army has sent a new "intelligent" weapon, known only under the code name XM-25, in Afghnistan.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict over there with Taliban and is "going to change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is as a super precise cannon
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of some meters.
The special ammunitions of caliber 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, works in fact as small grenades.
One can program the ammunitions in such a way that they will explode to the contact of the target but also to any point of their ballistic path.
One can use it therefore against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is not either a protégé of above and when falls it top a murderous rain of splinters of steel, that can put it out of fighting also.
According to Richard Audette who has set leaves to the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon of infantry that uses the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it mainly in such a way that it takes on the target, sends a laser beam that determines the distance to him, obtains thus a point of handbook aim, according to which he corrects his site aim and leans on the relaxation.
"Say that you have aimed at 543 meters."
"When you squeeze the relaxation, the weapon loads and gets out to the distance of 543 meters more or minus 1, 2, 3 meters, has indicated Audette.
400 delocalized jobs
The group Fujitsu delocalizes his subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 colleagues are going to transfer their workplace that is presently at the building of offices of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocalizes his branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As has asserted it Wednesday the giant specialized in the fabrication and the maintenance of the computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, situated until now on the place Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, immense complex of offices situated on the street Lyoner Straße du Quartier Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson of Fujitsu has explained that in the medium term, the group should gather 100 other jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The offer of rent has been extremely attractive. Besides, the offices at area opened from Astro Park suit better the way of work of the colleagues.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu has been a fair tenant.
The chief executive officer, Bernd Wagner, has declared: "Frankfurt-Niederrad constitutes for us a primordial place having a remarkable infrastructure."
He maintains that the connection to the airport is precisely of a great importance for a global firm as Fujitsu.
The new moving of an important firm inside the region has aroused the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The person in charge of the economic businesses of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), has declared that a time still, a "planetary actor" had thus been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of relative faith instead of establishment."
Fujitsu suits the city and his establishment constitutes an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction has very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our help to this firm," has declared Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relationships would not have been able to change anything to the difficulties of the manufacturer of computers opposite the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
After all, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is henceforth a matter of avoiding a so exceptional place remaining unoccupied during long.
"I have the hope that the owner and lessor of the building will appear cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of the Town Hall, used so far by the society Fujitsu and the "small" neighboring "vertical," as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the project of building debated of the spa.
Fruit of a linked project of the municipality and of a private developer of projects, a news entered of the city was created between the station and the town hall. This aroused numerous criticisms, not only because of the impressive conversion of the surfaces that served in the past in part as car park, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the society of notation and of advice in investment, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for the systems of distribution of the journeys, Start Amadeus, as Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at that time still associated with Siemens, have moved in in the buildings.
In 2006, The German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen has purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu in same time that the property fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings have been resold to the Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The group Fujitsu whose seat is in Tokyo considers himself as the third greater purveyor of computer products at the world.
For example, she puts firms of the computers and waiters to the arrangement and assures also the essential service.
His branch established in the region of the Rhine-Hand is one of the most important in Germany: Definitely Fujitsu counts more employees in Munich well.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other present subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a firm appointed TDS.
For that, 7000 square meters have taken in rent in the building Astro Park.
This complex old person of twenty years, whose name reminds his plan in the form of star, shelters the seat of the Confederation among others from the electronic and electrotechnical industry.
Expulsion of the waiter by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks has more and more difficulties.
The purveyor of services Internet Amazon has expelled of his waiters the site specialized in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude hides maybe political pressures undergone after the publications of the hundred thousands of secret diplomatic bills.
Apparently the founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, stays in England.
In the United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with always more de force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" does not have more access to his waiter accommodated so far in America and looks henceforth for a hébergeur in Europe.
For this time, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, has called the other countries and started to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched for by Interpol, probably stays in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the waiter Amazon."
"Freedom of expression to the country of the freedom," have indicated Wednesday (hour place) the cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Little beforehand, the cyber-firm, Amazon, had removed the documents of Wikileaks from his waiters.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic bills, the cyber-activists have had resort to the Web Service of Amazon (AWS) in order to be able to reach the greatest number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Tremendous, our dollars henceforth are spent to take care of the people in Europe."
While the freedom of expression puts a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, has reported that Amazon has forbidden Wikileaks to use his waiters after the inquiry led by the colleagues of the senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon of orchestrating a boycott at his encontre, has reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have hoped that Amazon takes this measure earlier had consideration to the previous publications by Wikileaks of the classified information" has asserted the senator.
In parallel, Mr. Liebermann has called the other countries to refuse the use of the waiters through the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous way and without scruples. In doing so, she puts our national safety in danger and in peril the life everywhere across the world," according to a communiqué of the senators independent.
"No firm conscious of his responsibilities, which it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to diffuse the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is searched for by the Swedish authorities because it is suspected of rape, appears on the list of people searched for by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the Londonian newspaper "The Independant," the Australian of 39 years lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is found it.
The cyber-activist has constantly described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the pursuits encouraged his encontre by Sweden.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, has declared in London that threats have been uttered against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder from Julian Assange."
It is why Assange fears particularly for his safety, has declared Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues hide.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to the declarations made of the north in America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has required that the persons in charge of the revelations made by Wikileaks is pursued and carried out for treachery.
In Canada, the adviser of the Mr. Head of Gevernment stephen To Tell Off has declared on television, to the obviousness of ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could use a Drone."
For this time, a debate has gone off between the white House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the American president, Mr. Barack Obama, has described as "absurdity and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange have required the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if this was responsible for the datum order to the diplomats, and divulged very lately, of giving oneself to activities of espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we must take care of the opinion of an owner individual of a Web site," declare Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are well more important than the assertions of a web site are."
The American government completely passes henceforth the protection of his data bases at the test bed.
According to a communiqué of the white House, Mr. Russell Travers, guiding attached of the Center of the anti-terrorist fight, has been named person in charge to fight against the escapes.
M. Travers is responsible to set up "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the divulgings of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The white House has also the will of verifying the means by which the whole administration exchanges and protects the information.
Moreover, the American government has announced that he wanted to take care of the safety of the dissidents and of the militants if these were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"Us have everything made of use to get with them in contact" has indicated the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that proves necessary."
The university of the Ice
At the "university Gelato" of Bologne, one prepares the confectioners of ice for the best seasons of the year.
The lesson of initiation of three days organized to the intention of the future glaciers has had a very great success and attracted visitors come of everybody integer.
By the way, of where comes all the ice?
Of the Glacier and of the machine to ice.
The glacier, in other words in German the confectioner of ice about little out of fashion, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of fabrication of the ice.
The turbine to ice takes the cream off ice of the window refrigerated with the aid of a spatula, arranges it in the waffle and afterwards starts selling it.
To know it, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologne.
But whoever wishes to know more on the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice-cream makers has founded the university of ice in 2003 so that the creams of ice taken out from his machines reply everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The lesson of initiation of three days organized to the intention of the future glaciers has had a very great success and attracted visitors come of everywhere in the world.
Also are offered of the special lessons dealing with the ice of chocolate and spreading on several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private ice-cream trade.
In full crisis of forty, some number of people dream of a new career, others are simply risked to realize their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, they are 40 participants come of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil to the Saudi Arabia going by by Hungary.
Jacky, teacher of artistic education come of California is interested in the movement Slow Food. He wants to propose in future a European product of quality at the country of the industrial Ice.
Anke of Berlin is an adviser in management of firm and she wants, after some years, to pull some thing of singular of this profession testing for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice-cream trade in Cairo.
A man originating from Malta and another come of Brazil would love to improve the quality of the cream frozen in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady has come because his children adore the Italian frozen creams.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari explains first to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices.
Is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget the cherry in the course of the training on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it preserves still a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first stage in the fabrication seems totally simple.
Luciano pours the ingredients of base, such than of the milk, of the cream, of the powder of milk, of the sugar and of the stabilizers into a great mixer that warms everything at 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools down immediately at four degrees.
It opens afterwards a faucet installed on the machine: he takes out some a white cream of pasteurized base, foundation of all the kinds of ices to the milk.
The trainer is immediately attacked of question: Is producing ice using only the natural substances without stabilizer possible?
How can one give free lesson to the personal pleasure of the experimentation?
M. Luciano warns against the fact to let itself lead in mistake by the mind of the time.
Maybe, the one that talks only about the ices "produced from the natural ingredients," has in spite of that used of the stabilizers: the most often a natural product, for example of the flour of seed of guar obtained from the bean from guar.
It is evidently possible to produce ice without using of stabilizer, only it must be sold in a deadline of 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not crunch anything else than of the granules of ice.
Some modifications of the mass of base are allowed.
That becomes more fascinating with the aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires fruits or sweetshops of the supermarket in the ray.
Moreover, there are powder and pastas.
"the purveyors will tempt everyone of palming yourself off dozen flavored ingredients."
"Though, you should simply try everything."
Is in the receipts of sorbets to the fruits with sugar and cool fruits.
Is in the frozen creams produced from the mass of white base that, adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, while one adds powder of cocoa, the base from all the possible desserts to the chocolate, to it.
Now, all the participants at the lesson must pass machines to the use at ice.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ices: to the vanilla, to the chocolate, to the mocha and to the hazel with or without eggs in the mass of base, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ices at the fruits are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more purées of fruits: of the viewpoint of the taste, that is not absolutely better.
The ice at the hazels does not comprise inevitably the taste of the walnut, while it consists in great part of hazels.
The ice to the kiwi, very popular, is produced from the group using more fruits, less water and one little less than stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture raises the taste of an ice correctly," asserts Luciano.
The fabrication of the ice is an exercise of calculation: if one uses purée of fishing with a lot of sugar, it must reduced the quantity of sugar in the recipe of base.
A supplement of sugar is some essentials for the ice at the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the content in sugar of the different types of fruits (the vinegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the must of grape).
Fortunately, the pictures facilitate the calculations.
The fabrication of the ice does not require more, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not the machine of automatic fabrication of the mass of base only that helps.
There is also a device in which one beats simultaneously the mixture of available ice to make it creamy and brought back at negative temperatures.
In spite of all the automatizations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brasilian Gustavo is daubed from purée of fruits from head to toe and, thus, splashes his friends of studies while the control of the colossal mixer bowl goes beyond it.
The master Luciano is of opinion that a "similar incident risks to happen during every lesson: it is only a question of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that tests the culture of the genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Authority of safety of the foods.
This accusation is now stated by the group of experts Testbiotech that is considered as an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of the biotechnology.
"That rings as a theory of the conspiracy, but us us well informed," has declared Wednesday To Munich M. Christoph Then, Manager of Testbiotech.
Some information make Efsa for the genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, state of what preside over it of the group of experts as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is financed by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
M. Kuiper has collaborated in a decisive way on the elaboration of the prescriptions of testing of the Efsa for the genetically modified plants and is, of this fact, clearly in a situation of conflict of interests, according to the criticisms stated by Mr. Then.
The elaborated prescriptions correspond literally to the stands of the pressure group Ilsi, by paragraphs, and take thus Parme the brand of the industry that, basically, would be controlled by the installed authorities in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A person in charge of high row of the Efsa lately has joined without condition or without transitory period the Swiss farming-related group Syngenta. In doing so, She has changed camp.
Little time ago, even the Radio of the Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relationships between the authority of the European Union responsible for the control and the industrial lobby, what has awakened the suspicions also well of Puts together it federal German for the environment that of the European deputies.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that one exploits all the reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of a good professional quality.
One does not forbid to the experts working for the account of the Efsa of tying of the contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
M. Kuiper admits that he works for the international institute for the sciences of the life (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organism considers itself as a neutral forum gathering the experts who belong, among others, to the domain of the sciences, of the industry and of the policy in order to evaluate the risks of the biotechnology without being to the balance of a lobby.
In this business, the independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without no testing of feeding among the animals and that one has not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We wish to know what are, for example, the incidences of the corn genetically modified cause to the field" asserts Mr. Then.
The present practice consists in testing uniquely the isolated proteins and not all the seedling genetically modified, what does not allow obtaining reliable results.
"If one does not search risk them, how one can then discover them?" Mr. Then questions itself on an accusatory tone.
It is also the viewpoint of Mme Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist carries out investigations for 1994 in the domain of the genetics and works presently at the polytechnic school of Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and henceforth also in Europe, the industrial sector tries more and more of influencing or of discrediting the critical scientists.
It is why, there are hardly still researchers who are not related to societies.
From the opinion of the firms, the critical studies would not be published.
Mme Hilbeck maintains that "the control industry searches for it on the safety."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell has obtained some, altogether 400 kilo about.
Monday afternoon, it was in front of the station of Stuttgart with his tube to the back.
There was manif.
It snowed.
The history is well-known: In September, the excavators had come and had started demolishing a great part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not more the the same one: Several thousand people has demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billions.
A great part of the wing was in ruins while the demonstration have opened on the stopping of the works of building.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the conchiferous calcium) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse cobblestone badly built between 1914 and 1920.
M. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years residing at Ostfildern.
He has obtained some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
It declares with enthusiasm: "one modest rock and good market, simple and terrestre."
Him asserting that cutting it to the saw, it has felt the smell of the smoke of cigarette.
He does not know still what it will make from this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell also.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead at an old ammunition dump of the French army in a forest situated close to Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire of stones.
This man of 44 years trades in old stones.
He has bought all the stones stemming from the demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge" he declares in his office situated in a hut, which was in the past a post on guard.
It tells that it has been the subject to insults and to threats while in September the newspapers have reported that it had buys the rest of the north wing to the firm of demolition.
But he has negotiated for whole days with the adversaries of the project S21.
And it has explained to them that it could not make at all anything to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be of continuing use the stone.
About 200 adversaries of the project S21 thereafter have taken one of the parallelepiped of stone weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is included between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Certain keeps it as memory in everything hoping also to be able to give back it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 loads complete of a truck.
About the half is still piled in the forest, the rest being for long sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape, Particular gardeners.
They have come of everywhere and have taken all it that could enter to the chest and tow them.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart have transformed themselves for long into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of the plates-bandes of herbs.
"By the way, this stone is not anything of individual" said Mr. Rongen.
"have-been this component talks about politics."
It enters to his car every ground, made le tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
It has made studies of right that it has abandoned. Later, he has started to study the biology before being interested thereafter to the one computer and of becoming finally a quarryman.
And an amateur of stones.
He stocks 40000 tons.
It builds up him treasures everywhere in Germany.
HE maintains that he is the greatest trader of the old stones.
It calms down.
Of the stones of sand sculpted with art are put on the snow.
"In the past, They were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, asserts with enthusiasm.
"My" preferred "stone."
He takes the path that goes up across the forest.
It shows a pile of the finger: Pierre of red sand, beforehand, left from the station of Karlsruhe.
And so forth.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped was formerly part of the stand of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and of the histories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the prefecture of police, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral saint Blasien, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
While Mr. Rongen thinks that formerly the stones were sculpted by hand and moved with the aid of simple hoists and of the carts pulled by oxen, it becomes totally respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a patrimony was put in part."
It has not become rich, still less richissime.
But this quarryman uses 14 people today. Moreover, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower of glass and a gardener have settled on the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," asserts the recycleur of waste.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
Over there as, there are stones to save.
Fight of talents to conquer the potential tops
The counter experiences some lively crowds.
16 students jostle themselves to buy to the salmon, of the tomato sauce and of the blancmanges, of buns.
The technical university of the Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited a workroom to the students in design and mechanical engineering.
Within the framework of a kind of competition of ideas, they must speak profession about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, going by, to experience the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, a number of firms do not hesitate to go to the infighting to the competition to dig out better brains and to start, as Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: Recruiting the holders of a diploma most endowed as much that possible in the amphitheaters before the latter do not arrive on the job market and that they are not courted by the others.
And since the universities do not publish declarations regarding the performances of their students, one tries to spot the exceptional talents within the framework of the practical projects and to secure the loyalty of them.
At the second day of the workroom organized to the university technique of the self-propelled Brauschweig the group coaxes the talents.
A young lady of the service of staff shares the pens, of the candies and of the cards comprising the logo of Volkswagen.
She talks about the calendar of the professional trainings and of the student jobs to the young talents; it shows them the paths to reach the wall of the group.
She is Nico Selle from the technical university of the Braunschweig that is responsible for the committed project with Volkswagen.
For it, there are reciprocal advantages for the two parts: "The students get with this industry sector in contact and improve experience."
"As for the group Volkswagen, it can experience the students, look furthermore at seriousness to the candidates and appreciate those that are taken into account as colleague."
According to Mr. saddle, Such a cooperation is unusual.
What is again, it is the offensive with which one tries to attract itself the students.
"In the past, the accent was put rather on the professional project," asserts Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of the new holders of a diploma will become well more pungent.
In goods of the sectors, the firms no more can recruit their colleagues carrying out one sorting on a crowd of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially court the highly qualified work force.
It is especially The holders of a diploma stemming from the paths of engineering that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of the German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 posts of engineers have remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the space relative to the posts of engineer will still expand.
Novel Dykta goes to the hunt for the talents for the account of KPMG, office of audit, of accounting expert evaluation and of advice.
It organizes expensive events aiming at the recruitment of the talents, as for example the cruise race KPMG-Race, a kind of rally-paper where the competitors must find their path with the aid of the coordinates GPS.
The firm is thus going to send eight promising students next year so that they go over the United States in this way.
The participants can secondarily visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the firm.
The one that must participate in it decides in advance after two procedures of selection.
Only the cream of the cream of the numerous candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of the potential tops in the universities are more and more important.
"We want to emerge from the share thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little from thing"
For the hunter of talents that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be to it.
"Up to today, we have stayed in contact with all the people having taken part the last year to a similar action."
"Some of them are to finishing their studies about and wish soon to address their requests to our firm." it asserts.
Outside the direct amadouement carried out in the campus, the small ones and attracted averages proceed from totally classical way participating in the professional fairs where they give themselves to the hunt for the brains.
"We try to affect the holders of a diploma participating in the professional lounges."
"For example, at the lounge of the solar technologies," indicate Mme Sitha Stübe, human manager of resources by Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic signs.
This firm installed in Bonn uses 1500 people about in Germany.
Mme Stübe has knowledge of the problems related to the relief.
Presently, 35 posts are put to the competition on the site of the firm.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to provide with the vacant posts."
"That costs expensive and takes much of time," it assures?
Another means of establishing the contact consists in going by by the teachers from university.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with different educational establishments superior, for example, the university of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of carrying out professional trainings or of writing his project of end of study at our places."
From the campaigns expensive advertising executives are announced by the specialists in the solar one.
It is for that that the firm tries to make his advertisement putting other qualities in exergue: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a great group can not make that," supports Mme Stübe, personnel manager.
It is long that the money does not keep anymore the main role in the research of job.
The hours of work flexible, the child minder or good possibilities of promotion appoint the other factors determiners.
According to a study led by the institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute constitutes an annual honor roll of the German employers.
For that purpose, he questions the colleagues about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and to his context all looking at the conditions-frames of the employees.
The personnel manager Mme Stübe hopes that this investment will allow enhancing the picture with the society next to the job-seekers.
"I think that the candidates leave especially to the external evaluations in what concerns a potential employer," it declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) recommends the firms that wish to build a good reputation as employer to themselves applying a strategy in the long term.
He recommends his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means to take above all internal measures.
"The best means for an employer of making oneself attractive is of going by by her specificity colleagues," it asserts.
That is called the strategy of internal picture, in other words the creation of the brand image of the employer within his real specificity, according to the gibberish used in the sector.
"the satisfied colleagues form the best messengers."
While one treats his employees well and that they identify themselves with the firm, they make very alone the advertisement of their employer next to their friends and knowledge.
"It is as if one played in an orchestra," declares Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake to the new oil drillings
There will not be new drillings of oil in the gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of the south-east of the United States, in the course of the years to come.
The government of Washington has pronounced a ban An equivalent ban and, thus, definitively canceled his initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drillings are for the moment banned.
The secretary at the Inside Ken Salazar has made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the platform of drilling "Deepwater Horizon" that is at the origin of this strict ban. This must remain in force at least for the five next years.
In view of this accident that to cost the life to eleven employees and canal to the greatest environmental disaster of the United States, the President Barack Obama, subjected to the pressure of the opposition and of this sector of activity, had indicated that it was willing to authorize the realization of new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The partisans of this solution want to reduce thus the dependence of the United States in relation to the foreign countries with regard to the supplying to oil.
The question of knowing that carries the responsibility of the devastating oil slick in the golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is confronted with requests of compensation of several billions, finds itself of the accusations at the center.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama must present his conclusions running December.
In October, the secretary at the Inside Ken Salazar had raised the frost of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Subsequent to this decision, different oil groups immediately had presented of the requests relative to new projects of drilling.
With measures of controls stricter and orders of safety more severe, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent authority of control, who has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is presently the subject of re-form in depth.
In parallel, Mr. Obama has announced would remove them the lucrative ones fiscal kennels of the gas and oil groups.
The actors of this sector of activity put henceforth in guard publicly against the fact that the debit of feeding in the gulf would be clearly weaker than it is the case until now.
"The objective of the government is of putting a brake to the fast growth of the sector of the gas and of the oil" according to the result of a survey present realized in the sector by the office of audit BDO, before the ban of drilling pronounced Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance laments the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the rules."
The investments consented in new projects of support have been taken back up to new order, to the detriment of the growth.
The country Ogoni is dry
The water who flows in the rivers is oiled brown; it brings out a smell similar to the one that exists in the station from gasoline: Because of one escape, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
The men live on flight, on corruption and on the refining of the oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"You do not exhaust," throws the ecological militant the journalists to calm them: "You today still enough of mud of oil in front of the lens of water."
The Nigerian of 37 years has tried to photograph a teenager pushed in in the muddy water up to the chest, as the fatty trail that surrounds it: This scene seems nearly beautiful in the splinter of water to the color of the rainbow.
One can not notice that the basement abounds in brown tablecloths of crude oil.
On the shore of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom tells that, formerly, it gathered shrimps by whole buckets here.
But meanwhile the quiet waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous quantity of oil has spurted out from a pipeline having exploded in the immense marsh.
The fishermen dwelling on the small city neighboring of Bodo must henceforth row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The country Ogoni situated at the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered as one of the regions most polluted at the world.
The whole area of the devastations jumps to the eyes while one goes over the marshes of mangrove swamp crossed by lessons of waters.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat cracks a chestnut water cradingue. Whoever dives into it his hand withdraws it all covered with oil.
The roots of small of the mangrove swamp emergent from the ground as sticks of licorice. The isolated palm trees let sadly hang their palms.
One looks in vain for the swarms of birds, as one usually meets some in the moist zones: Dice that the hors-bord motor stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of in the past that looks like a filling station by the smell that it brings out.
"What happens here, it is war against the environment" declares Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in what concerns the health."
The comparison of the wars is made.
The region that the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for tens of years: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have come here; the first resistance was organized in the years 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was carried out later. In 1993, the group Shell has had to interrupt his activities of production in this region because these had become very dangerous for his employees.
Today still, the return to the country Ogoni is forbidden to this society: Even though more than 2 million of barrel of black gold are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometers of pipelines on the whole of the region of the Delta, three times big as Switzerland, the oil fields of the country Ogoni are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few a hundred meters rise up in the water of the trestles in steel as strange sculptures: One refers very affectionately "to Christmas trees" the heads of holes of drilling.
They have until 50 years, the majority are eaten by the corrosion up to the mark.
Akpobari considers that a head of drilling of this nature breaks from time to time in piece, because a constant stream of crude oil flows in the water.
According to the appraisals of the experts, more than two billion liters are poured themselves on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the equivalent quantity of oil to that that has sold in the sea during the accident of the high-octane gasoline-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the greatest shatters environmental in the history humanity.
Who must carry the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? the reply to this question divides the actor.
For the group Shell, the sabotage and the siphonage of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 pourcent of the pollution. The environmentalists for their part consider the explosions of the heads of drilling and the perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner reproached to the group Shell for applying mainly less strict norms of safety in Nigeria than in everywhere else in the world: Only the rate of weaknesses of the behaviors is raised still well more than alleures" is.
Some forms emerge of the mangrove swamps to a place that, seen by far, looks like an abandoned workroom, fullness of grease and installed to the open air: They are completely nudes and place settings of grease to the hilt.
A fire glitters under one with the numerous barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be répérés: a small secret refinery.
One makes to warm the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of team.
At first, the gasoline comes to a container going by by pipes, afterwards, to the end of the behavior drops of kerosene fall and one obtains finally of the diesel.
It is as Michael and his four colleagues produce daily four boles of Diesel of 300 liters: "That brings in 34 000 Naira, about 22 dollars, to us.
The inhabitants of the Delta pull left of the chronic shortage of fuel in the greatest producing country of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a less expensive price that that ridiculously bottom of hardly 40 centimes of Euro by liter of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
this is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of the pipelines in drill everywhere across the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses 16 million liters of crude oil in this way at least on the whole from the Delta of Niger.
Only a small totally insignificant part of the raw material provisionally stored illegally is purified: The networks of the organized crime that count also among his members politicians and servicemen of high row, load the part with the lion in tankers and sell it off on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the lax debate dealing with the question of knowledge if the environmental disaster must be attributed or rather the lax subversive activities to the population or to the way of production is purely academic.
"If the oil societies were not not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen so deeply were not destroyed, either sabotage, or flight and illegal refineries would not be."
But, Meanwhile, the relationships Ogoni especially in relation to Shell so have deteriorated that it was not anymore question only of the withdrawal of the group. "maybe that the operators having other nationalities, as the Chinese ones, him better révèleront."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is" high time "that you leave" announces the industrial sturdy one of the oil.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special unity of the armed forces, they will not be indeed the subject to an arrest, but at most they will offer to them of the containers-of-wine.
Even the soldiers especially originating from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material as all the Nigerians.
"To every viewpoint, this capable thing has made to beat our pretty low country," regrets Akpori.
The investigators discover defects of building in the reactors of l'A380
L'A380 suffers obviously from a big problem of safety.
Examining a device that has carried out a landing of urgency, the investigators have discovered a possible defect of building that can drive to "catastrophic weakness from the reactor."
The airline Qantas wants to lodge now a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
Beginning November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas visibly had had so far more of luck: In the course of the inquiry that it has led, the Australian authority responsible for the aerial safety has noticed that the reactors of some devices A380 presented a serious problem of safety, and it warns against a possible defect of building.
This potential weakness could lead to serious consequences: It can cause coves of tiredness and escapes as regards the linking of the behavior of oil, one indicates in a stand published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It would have been able to drive "reactors" to a "catastrophic weakness."
Are concerned the produced reactors Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft with the series A380.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which has had to land of urgency on November 4th in Singapore, face among these.
The Australian airline has henceforth started judicial pursuits against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She has put down a judicial complaint next to an Australian federal court whose seat is at Sydney. This move gives him the possibility of taking other legal measures against the society.
The manager of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, has declared that his company would ask for dommages-intérêts in relation to the occurred incident beginning November.
Parts have freed themselves and the carrying surface has been damaged during the fire of the motor.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is at the origin of the damages.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators have announced that of other tests relative to the safety be realized on the superjumbos that also the reactors are equipped in questions.
The recommendations of safety are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, has indicated the spokesperson of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The problem of safety is considered as sufficiently important to inform all the concerned parts.
After the landing of urgency of his airplane, the airline Quantas had immobilized all his fleet d'A380 at the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of his eleven A380.
The company Lufthansa has replaced, as a precaution, the reactor of a A380.
The airplane at two stories is the greatest airliner at the world.
The snowfall on the whole territory causes a chaos in the transports
The Germany all covered with white: In a night, the snow has fallen nearly on the whole country.
The chaos reigns over all the roads, the trains and the airplanes are immobilized.
At least three people are dead in accidents of circulation.
The winter makes Germany shiver: By icy temperatures, nearly the whole republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, what drives to the chaos to numerous localities.
Northwards and eastwards, the blanket of snow reaches 15 centimeters through places.
The circulation is strongly restricted on several motorways and on numerous roads.
On the national one A7 to Flensburg, the staff of the service of winter has worked in a permanent way, but they have not been able to come to end of the snow that did not stop building up.
Moreover, violent gusts have swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The federal Office responsible for the maritime navigation and for the hydrography (DSH) is waited for to it the tidal waves have place known the baltique coast of Schleswig-Holstein with levels of water being able to reach 1,2 m above the normal one.
The masses of snow on the motorways and on the federal roads have led to serious problems in Dresden China.
It is why the central one of alert of bad time Meteomedia has announced the level of purple alert has been announced in the Saxon Switzerland: actually, it is the highest level.
By places, he has run into it 30 centimeters of cool snow that the strong and cool winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars have remained wedged the night.
Even in the land of saxe-Anhalt, the authorities of police have announced serious disruptions on the roads.
On the motorway A2, the snow and the wind have led to a break of the circulation and caused corks.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls have affected the motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions of the railroad traffic have taken place in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringia and to the north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railroads, the trees fallen on the railroad tracks, the catenarian ones or the destroyed needles.
In Saxe, one has had to interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
At Sallfeld, in Thuringia, a train ICE bound for Munich has had to interrupt his journey.
The sappers-firefighters and the paramedical ones have had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow have swept the roads.
The Snowfalls have led to numerous annulations of flight in the main airports of Germany.
According to a spokesperson of the switchboard and information on the flights, some annulations are already announced in Munich.
One spokesperson of Fraport indicates that 40 flights already have been canceled in Frankfurt on the Hand.
The service of winter assures a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers pinched at the airport are not no more numerous, in spite of that hardly 400 beds are put to their arrangement.
Accidents have happened Wednesday afternoon on numerous roads.
The night at Ostholstein, a driver of truck has lost the life during a collision with a train at a grade crossing.
The driver of the train has been lightly a casualty.
Because of the present coats of snow on the roads, a similar accident has happened not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck has been snatched at a grade crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver has lost the life.
Four passengers have been hurt in the train, it is why the going road of Bayreuth in Nuremberg has been closed until the morning hours.
Moreover, a woman of 30 years has died while his car has made barrel on a slippery street to Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be indeed soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of light gusts.
But, the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be upset by violent and fast winds.
It is though very cold, up to minus 15 degrees by places.
The Deutsche Bank looks for a purchaser for his twins turns.
The deutsche Bank tries to separate itself from his symbol: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution looks for purchasers for his two buildings of offices situated at his seat of Frankfurt.
This building could bring back up to 500 million of Euro.
The Deutsche Bank comes very fair of embellishing the seat of the group: The twin towers situated in the Area of businesses have been modernized; waiting, the bankers have had to return to their old place on duty.
Henceforth, the financial group tries obviously to recover the costs of renovations and he looks for a purchaser for his two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," quoting a spokesperson, writes it.
This spokesperson has not indicated the reasons of the predicted sale.
It has declared "we verify if it is more interesting of occupying nous-même the buildings or of selling them, and of putting them again in rent ulteriorly."
It is as the greatest financial institution of Germany already has given up his seat, little time after.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had acquired the twins turns for an amount of 272 million of Euro next to the possessors of own funds. It them afterwards had rehabilitated.
The transformations aiming at the optimization energetic have gulped, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.

Thousands of people mourn for the minors who have perished.
In Nouvelle-Zélande, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried minors who have been declared dead subsequent to several explosions occurred in an expression.
One had yet not been able to go back the bodies because the security situation of the disaster-stricken well continues be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion has happened in Pike River Mine close to the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age is located between 17 and 62 years had been buried under earth.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster-stricken well, but one had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Because of the strong concentration of toxic gases and of the other explosions that have followed, no team of help has been able to go down to the expression for reasons of safety.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors did not have any luck of surviving anymore.
So far the bodies could not by having risen.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun bursting at Greymouth to the south of the New Zealand island.
They have observed two minutes of silence.
In dissertation of the 29 buried minors, one has installed 29 count on which one could see the names, helmets and lights.
The photos and personal effects, among which the clothes and the surf boards, also their place were.
The flags have been put at half-mast in front of all the public edifices of the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key has declared to the participants to the commemorative party that the Nouvelle-Zélande has fed the hope that the minors would go back to the surface.
"But they have never fit at home."
M. Lawrie Drew of which the son Zen has been buried in the pits has declared that it can not resign to accepting the death of his son as long as he will not have seen his rests.
Beside the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats have taken part in the commemorative party.
Minors of South African and British origin have also buried during the first explosion of November 19th.
The first-aid workers have started putting out a fire inside the coal mine of the island of the South of New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles has explained to the journalists that while massage them of explosive gases are misplaced, the burning temperatures inside the expression start lowering.
Go in hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," epic of the combatant.
What public has the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well been able to think about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only an eye is made imprisoned; it frees itself from his torturer and, with a nearly supernatural strength, eliminates his adversaries ones after the others. That seems ideal for the young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. While it is bad mood, it extracts the intestines of his enemies without waiting for these to be dead.
From another side, up to at the end of the film, the one-eyed one does not say any word on his true name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, in the course of one or two sentences some shouts of agony dreadful.
Otherwise, one does not say anything and one feasts in the unbelievably beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that constitutes the setting of the universe of the Vikings, for a thousand years.
It would be ideal more the mature directors having an interest as the existentialism and as the excellent trackings.
While a film aims at several groups-targets, it is shame that these exclude themselves mutually.
The director Winding Refn is considered, from the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy relative to the trafficker of shy drug and lots of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses to bring a bit more in the mood to the dominant current or to introduce a bit less brutality to the cinema of art and of testing.
Most of the sympathizers of the cinema of art must feel horror opposite the brain that spreads very around and to the intestines.
The amateurs of films of action die of boredom, while the one-eyed one embarks, for reasons that one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the quietness and the mist before the crew happens in America and continue hush up itself.
It is not then astonishing that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any distributor of films in Germany and that is only under the format DVD.
It is especially because of the magnificent pictures of the misery that has deserved some attention, but also because the picture of a film beating, now and again, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a matter of dialogs in this film, nor of a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The spectator can not get away.
Refn hardly agrees him a moment of relaxation and cuts it the throat slowly with icy pictures and a gloomy soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that spurts out of the heart of the characters.
Only a young fair boy, who behaves faithfully at the sides of the one-eyed one, protects some innocence, all the others are livened up by the anger.
More than all, the one-eyed hero of which the motives never are known, but that comes back of the hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally of the allies transforming oneself into warrior, is maybe in messenger of the devil himself.
It represents the deterioration, but maybe also, nothing that for those that are, of everything way, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which has the irritation, the enthusiasm and the amazement as purpose.
A traumatizing experience.
Mysterious works of earthwork
The international agency of the atomic power (AIEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take position on this subject, still less than to subject itself to the controls of the agency.
In the night of 5 on September 6th, 2007 to midnight, to the minus four interceptors F-15 I Israeli have attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate; the greatest city situated to nearness feels at 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
His face name in the documents of the AIEA, because it is question of the reactor that Syria has built seems with the help of the Korea of the north in parallelepiped of stone, concealed in a valley marked by the absence of electric charge.
According to a briefing of the information services of the United States, the CIA, dating back to thin April 2008,le ordinary reactor, known under the name of the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be pretty capable of producing plutonium, which would allow producing the atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid for the years 1950.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation comprising blurred satellite pictures.
Through the animation helped by computer, it indicated the probable place of every component of the reactor before the destruction of the central one that represents a copy in miniature of the north-Korean model of the nuclear central one of Yongbyon.
Besides, it has presented the photos showing the building situated to nearness, indeed the inside of this.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of being put into service, but yet it was not equipped with bars of fuels.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, one has of hardly more information than at that time, and even, with the time the mystery thickens more and more.
The previous president of the United States George W. Bush lately has revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was indeed sure about Syria having built a reactor to el-Kibar, but did not have little clues showing it country developed "an active program of nuclear armament."
Some agents of information in Europe prefer to be more careful on that subject and talk only about one "presumed reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
Him their lack of the tangible proofs, as to the AIEA.
Questioned about the way whose business he checks that it has to a nuclear reactor, a diplomat of high row of the Nations Unis has not given only a laconic reply in summer maintaining that the AIEA had "documents sufficing to ask questions."
The Syrian ones have probably taken the rubbles with haste off the "unused military building" and conducted a methodical levelling of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of the experts of the AIEA driven by the inspecting antiques in leader Oli Heinonen, has discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by the men.
Moreover, the AIEA has received thanks to a Member State pictures of satellites of the commercial recipients showing the moment that has followed the attack directly. it seems that the latter are more eloquent that those presented by the CIA.
Though, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous backer, maybe Israel, has acquired them in exclusiveness.
It is an impossibleness of this fact for the AIEA of establishing their authenticity in an objective way.
Syria has always assured that it had never realized a secret atomic program and that she had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium taken on on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the AIEA has impugned this argument after the analysis of the particles describing it as unlikely.
For that time, damask refuses every discussion to this intention, all as about the pictures of satellite.
Besides, Syria does not allow to the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refusal the access to the rubbles of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, same Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then First Minister in exercise at the moment of the attack, lately has declared: "We will never make comments on that subject."
It is as the inquiry relative to this business drags out since June 2008 without one getting to a result and that it "transforms itself into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency more and more," as a western diplomat of high row recognizes it in operation at the seat of the AIEA in Vienna, finally it is a matter of a serious violation of the treaty of ban of the nuclear weapons.
The AIEA considers that to realize progress, the existence of the three other installations that must have "a functional relation" with the one presumed reactor must be clarified.
Until now, the inspectors do not have nor advisable of what installations it is a matter here, nor what is their duty or what one suspects them of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj have-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the name of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute Institute heart Science and International Security (international institute of the sciences and of the international safety) of Washington has identified these localities and overdraft on pictures of satellites a complex close to Masyaf that would be one of the suspicious objects very probably.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside this; it is exactly the reason why Syria refuses the inspectors of the AIEA the access of the three sites.
In Vienna, one maintains that the Syrians dread that the group of inspection is in fact spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the AIEA in order to to follow the military installations.
To tell the truth, it is an information supplied by the American secret agents that attracted the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The AIEA has the information, including the satellites photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallelepiped of stone in order to move substances.
A western diplomat of high row has declared in Vienna that at least one of the installations could be used to the production of the fuel.
It "would not have indications regarding sensitive activities," such as the enrichment and the reprocessing of the uranium; processes that are essential to the production of the atomic weapons.
This type of reactor probably works thanks to the not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are at the outside plausible hypotheses regarding the next fundamental questions: of where should have come the uranium and where one would have separated more late the plutonium necessary for the fabrication of the bomb.
One overlooks if the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, has been stocked in the three sites.
While the hundred trucks loaded with earth will have disappeared, nobody will have information on the place of stocking of the rubble.
For the AIEA, him, is little probable that Syria has made to examine in 1998 the expression of salt of al-Tibni, situated only at some kilometers of el-Kibar, across of the Euphrate, to see if it can suit the stocking of the radioactive waste.
Analyzing lately photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the inspecting antiques of the AIEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show however that Syria has started works of earthwork in the three suspicious sites and moved of enormous containers while the AIEA started requiring the access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but that has not contributed to discard the suspicions.
In he tells to itself in the diplomatic environments that the AIEA has spent several months to elaborate a plan regarding the inspections to carry out. This plan had to allow in Syria protecting servicemen from possible secrets. Only the surrounded time shows what great interest the inspectors carry to this business.
For this time, Damascus has also disregarded of this suggestion.
A year ago, if the western diplomats in Vienna not have not made state of the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signaled for this business, asserts, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who evokes since some months what is known under the name the special inspections, one of the means the most powerful of which the atomic Agency arranges to make of his controls use.
The manager of the AIEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who has had to propose these inspections, has already talked indeed about "an option at which I am open in future," but he still hesitates.
This means comprises an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority to the Advice of the governors of the AIEA and a good number of the 35 countries that are represented with it do not have any desire of seeing the situation experience a climbing.
on the other hand, as this diplomat that gives to réflechir: "Thereto would it serve, if in the end they do not take on anything"
The love in time of war
That goes badly since Angelina Jolie has made his beginnings in summer as director.
It has written the script itself: it is a history of love between a woman originating from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
One does not know anything furthermore about this history, but that suffices to cause the uneasiness.
One persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, has beaten lover of his Serbian torturer during the war of Yugoslavia.
The federations of the bosniaques women have immediately protested. In reply, some sequences of filming foreseen in Sarajevo have been moved in last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is turned in Hungary, but in the stage of post-production, the protests continue always in Bosnia.
According to information published in a bosniaque newspaper, Bakira Hasecic the organization of the victim women of war has addressed a correspondence in Angelina Jolie by the intervention of the High police station of the United Nations for the refugees (HCR) and it has required of meeting the actress. Pretty is itself ambassadress of goodwill of the HCR.
It is not diplomatic. Some weeks ago already, it has offered to these women to keep a meeting with them in Hungary, but these have declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," asserts Hasecic.
There have not been histories of love in the concentration camps, and the script of Pretty in called long enough on his attitude to the victims.
The Guardian reports Angelina Jolie that the organization of Hasecic has, thereafter, commended itself to the high police station of the United Nations of withdrawing the quality from ambassadress of goodwill.
But, by the way, what Pretty kind of script has written?
The bosniaque ministry of the culture, which has received copies of his script, has matched after some hesitations an authorization of filming to Sarajevo, but one does not know why afterwards has not come in spite of this authorization.
The young author assures itself that it does not hound policies with the objectives with his film, that it is making many efforts that she has started to the current of the yougoslave conflict. She maintains that she wants to put the terrible consequences of the war in exergue and to give the possibility to all the parts taking of expressing oneself.
It remains however wave about the contents.
It is as a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net one. It is different enough: The lovers knew themselves well before the beginning of the war. Him him meet again while the woman, a bosniaque Muslim, is deported in the Serb concentration camp where the man works as guard.
What constitutes all the same a great difference with the version "a victim of rape becomes itself infatuated of his torturer."
That the film of Pretty have begun well before the war, of course.
The pressure that exercises over it, thus expresses Pretty, is "unfair and based on erronnées information."
Henceforth, only the fanatics of Hollywood can obtain it the peace: Putting illegally this script in the Net one, as well of other beforehand.
Do we pull!
Tonight, everything is again fine among the Irish.
not trace of consternation.
It is why the local team dominates excessively the visitors come of Sweden, of Finland and of the United States.
The fans shriek of joy on bottom of a strong music, they stamp with the feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in irlande of the south vibrates parce the players throw and succeed in making to fall of the balls of table tennis to a distance of three meters in beakers to beer of the opposing team.
This strange show is called "beer-pong." The winner pockets 500 Euros more a ticket of airplane allowing to him of going to attend in January Las Vegas to the championship of the world of beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle game to drink and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors are not really fine together.
And nevertheless, in spite of that, the young man of 26 years tries to enjoy himself, to turn away from the térébrante question, what will lead on to the future.
The pleasure of playing at Las Vegas does not appear in his projects. In January, he will direct maintenances from hiring in New Zealand.
"I test however a strange feeling" asserts.
"The native country is so far and I do not have job as it."
Finally: His friend waits for it already to Auckland, "in less than two, she has unhooked his job wished for as responsible for factual project, maybe a good sign" said the young man smiling.
Because of the dark perspectives to the country, two of the three sisters of Tanning have tempted their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides at Sydney, his brother Colin occupies now a post of consultant in computing in London.
The youths go away: The situation of most of the families that live on the island look to that of the to tan.
The experts of the Institute of economic investigations and social indicate that 100,000 Irish will leave soon their country.
They foresee even a number of 200,000 emigrants of here at 2015.
What represents an enormous loss for a small country of 4,5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that whose Ireland has suffered in the years 1980.
After a decade of economic boom in the course of which the Irish have enjoys a great ease, the sorrow takes henceforth all the place.
The economic crisis touches however especially the young, well formed Irish, who have known until now only moments of happiness.
The loss of job and the social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there is money excessively.
But, meanwhile, three people towards ten of less than thirty years are on welfare.
The newspaper Irish Times publishes plentifully the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes à la dérive."
"An uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but the one that has the possibilities should be, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The latter to leave subdues the light."
The student in right Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of the Irish students, sees point a darker future because the government makes only to throw powder to the eyes and does not offer the young people any perspective of future.
"They reduce the salaries minimum, but they do not have any strategy to create new jobs," declares the teenager étudiante of 20 years.
It sees how his friends is clung itself of a practical training not paid to another.
She declares that are her more big worries is of emigrating itself in four years.
"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However the men as Stephen McLarnon to try of approaching this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the lounge "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers a collection support on the theme "to work abroad."
"But the work abroad constitutes for the new ones in the profession an extraordinary occasion of making the first steps in the steps of the professional hierarchy," asserts the person in charge.
His web site shows the photos of the overirons in Australia and of the surfers of the snows at the canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galley, but that guarantees also the freedom and the pleasure.
Since six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what means to be based elsewhere.
As there was not anything more to make in Ireland for this engineer of 29 years, it works henceforth with 15 Irish colleagues in the sector of the e building Germany.
A house of fashion goes out precisely from earth to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue work on other projects Hannovre or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan visits only seldom his country native, because he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to finish reimbursing the credit contracted to build his house at the native country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," it asserts of it overcoming the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland that I do not live virtually anymore."
It bursts of a laugh cluttered crossing the cold storage chambers.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens of in front pretty neat, expensive cars of great brands are parked on the filter lanes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan has bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed at 100 pourcent by the credit.
"They were moments of madness, undoubtedly, the money was easy," it asserts.
To-you him fear of seeing everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a moment, ressert of the warm tea and declares: "I do not have children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes askew, I can go to zero again."
The engineer of the building does not like the wailings that he hears often lately.
"Nobody must suffer from the hunger, our situation is nevertheless not so dramatic as what one has lived in the past here in the island," supports.
"Working for a moment abroad, it is not what can happen of worse, maybe it is it that makes that we felt first Irish.
He laughs and talks afterwards about his father who has gone in England during the last great economic crisis.
"It was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, the life continued, quite simply."
This idea pleases in Cian Tanner.
Leaving the future and to discover how the life happens elsewhere.
In his list of winners, He counts already some years of work in London. It is the reason why the life must not be so easy in Nouvelle-Zélande for it and for his friend.
But there is still a thing that worries it well these last days: the party to organize on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that it can transform itself into evening of farewell.
"Only, not many emotions," it says of it drinking a long mouthful of beer.
"A farewell, that seems all the same worrying."
Let's "call that rather an evening of goodbye, all released, gathering some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
The support to the democracy in Latin America continues increase, all as that to the private firm.
The crime has become a greater anxiety than the unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a great part of the region are.
They are there some of the conclusions of the last survey Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published in exclusiveness by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been realized in a regular way for 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and at the beginning of October.
The first is the mood sunny enough of Latin America.
The second is the increasing one stability of the attitudes to the democracy and his main institutions.
The support to the democracy has increased noticeably in several countries on the circumference of the Pacific of South America (to see picture 1).
For example to Peru, where the economic growth has affected on average 6% per annum for 2002, the support to the democracy has passed from a minimum of 40% in 2005 at 61% this year.
It has also increased in the Mexico, where the economics has straightened up after having suffered a strong fall of the production last year.
But only about half of the servers to Mexico and to Brazil, the two countries most filled with the region, are convinced democrats, what makes to lower the regional average (to see picture 2).
Some 44% servers of the region have declared themselves satisfied with the way in which the democracy of their country worked in the practice; it is a matter of the same number than the year last but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (diagram 3)
Some 34% have said that they trusted in the Parliament about their country and 45% in their government, the ones same as the last year in the two cases; but in strong rise in relation to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined the support to the democracy.
If that has held out during the financial world crisis, probably it is owed by the way that of numerous of country of America have not suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong resumption.
Moreover, a network of social insurance has contributed to protect the poor ones.
(The economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America has brought back this week that the proportion the Latin Americans living in the poverty have not increased only lightly in 2009 and again has lowered this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from a country at the other one (cf. diagram 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is translated by a largely divided feeling of progress
It that is rarer at Mexico and in Central America where the recession has been more severe and where the violent crimes have deteriorated.
It is only for the second time since the survey has begun that more servers across Latin America in his unity have quoted the crime rather than the unemployment as being the most important problem for their country (to see picture 5).
About 31% say that themselves or an of their close relation have been a victim of a criminal act in the course of the past year; nevertheless, this number is on the decline the last year in relation to the 38% and is the lowest for 1995.
A sturdier economic performance is reflected in the rise of support to the private firm and the free market: about 71% of the servers of the region say that the private firm is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (cf. diagram 6).
Some 58% value that the free market is the only system that will make their country developed, against last 47% the year.
Made interesting, 62% of the servers in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private firm); even if their president of left, Hugo Chavez, expropriates numerous private firms.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the people questioned (against last 18% the year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged in relation to the last year) and the Venezuela (9%, on the decline of 11% for the last year)
But the United States are considered as the most influential country by the servers at Mexico and in the greatest part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in Dominican Republic and at Nicaragua.
A soiled vote
Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28th.
But it was well worse disaster-stricken and plunged into the fear than the outsiders that wanted to help the country were.
One has presented boxes of ballot and a new ballot, of the unsystematic ballot papers in the goutières, of the devastated polling stations and of the intimidations
The polling stations opened the night late.
A lot of Hatïens, including of numerous that have been moved with reference to the earthquake of January, wandered in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them have ended up abandoning.
A dozen candidates for the presidential one of which several presumed favorites, have denounced the fraud and have asked for the annulation of the election.
Of the protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the high ranking official in Haiti of the United Nations Organization, considers the event how "an election good enough for many considerations."
Of the observers of the Organization American States and the Community of the Caribbean have declared carefully that they did not "believe only these irregularities, also serious they are, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In Other Words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, of which the opponents are indebted to Reborn Prevalley, outgoing president unpopular, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The second turn waited for is foreseen for January.
Every hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, a previous first lady, have withdrawn from their initial call so that the vote is declared none.
But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, which has little or not of perceptible support by the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second turn.
With an epidemic of cholera that makes rage, and more than 1 millions of survivors to the earthquake who live still in tents, one feared that the participation would be.
In the occurence, numerous Haitïens wanted to vote but they have been prevented from making it because of the disorganization.
Close to 250 000 identity cards, necessary to vote, little time before the election was not yet distributed.
The stake is important.
The donors see the election of a government popular and legitimate as an important stage in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, the Haitians make it eux-même.
The point of the feet to the center
The weeks after having become in a sudden way widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy of the public that has improved his rate of approval of 20 points, to plus of 50%; it is a matter of his highest level since it has been taken up in 2007.
Nevertheless, to transform that into a campaign succeeded for a second mandate during an election next year could depend on the choice of Mme Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which it would abandon or not the intransigence of his defunct husband, predecessor and previous partner talks about politics, Néstor Kirchner.
And, to this intention, the signs remain confused.
M. Kirchner, which has continued manage the economic policy, even after his woman succeeds it as president, was used to elaborating budgets that underestimated the tax revenues, the economic growth and the inflation.
That has allowed the first couple of spending the additional incomes at will.
The government of Mme Fernández has lost his majority to the Conference last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk in the distress with reference to the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the péroniste movement in power have joined Mme Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a member of parliament has struck one of his peers to the face and where others have accused the government of corruption), the Conference does not have to approve of the budget 2011.
"I am not going to quarrel," has declared the president.
Presently, the budget 2010 will be applied next year, leaving the president still a greater maneuvering space to spend at will.
The economics overheats largely: it is likely to grow close up of 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is located now to 11,1% but numerous private appraisals and the salary claims of the unions, see this number close to 30%.
M. Kirchner, who has taken his duties in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of the growth and of the reduction of the poverty, rather that of the control of the inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, he has harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, that has conducted falsifications of statistics on the official inflation.
Mme Fernández can at present to moderate these policies?
It has called to talks between the private firms and the union leaders.
And his officials tell 18% that they want to limit the pay rises next year.
The economics has been stimulated by world prices put up from the agricultural exportations of Argentina.
But the inflation has eroded the blow of thumb to the growth with reference to a strong devaluation in 2002.
It is maybe the reason why Mme Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore the financial relationships of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a forced previous restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled his dates in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 a trillion.
The Kirchner always have stressed the fact that it could not imply a surveillance by the IMF, as it is of custom.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the minister of the Economics, has announced that the Fund would supply a "technical assistance" to conceive a new national clue of the prizes for the consumption; what looks like a prelude of the decontamination of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mme Fernández wants to stay in the policy beyond the end of his mandate, maintaining that his husband is not at his sides anymore.
If it makes it, it needs to win support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
While the Argentinians be come back of their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for it will have gone back.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, of numerous policies of his husband.
A half-cheer for China
The taiwanais voters are him directed to a sort of a narrower union with the continent.
What Taiwan thinks of his great brother situated across of the strait?
More than 7,5 million voters have appeared on November 27th, or 70% of the admissible people, to elect the mayors and aldermen in five urban districts, within the framework of what is considered as a general evaluation of the president, My Ying-jeou.
M. My is itself become a substitute for the feelings in relation to the continent, having tied of the innovative links of businesses, including a pact of free trade partial, in the greatest reorganization of the relationships with the China properly said for 1949.
M. My succeeded the test, but very fair.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has taken away three of the five town halls, he has failed to take away the majority of voices.
Instead of that, the Democratic Party-progressive (DPP), which has leaned over to the complete independence of Taiwan, has taken away all votes close to 50% for the KMT of 45%.
If that had been a presidential ballot, M. My would be in difficulty.
Since it was taken up two years ago, the part of vote of his party has fallen of about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the town councils.
The event has unveiled most of the main subjects of the taiwanaises elections, including trucks to campaign noisy and of the flags of union of mass with girls who danced in minimal dress.
An attempt of compulsory mysterious murder has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Link Chan, honorary president of the KMT, has realized an electoral round for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd has gotten out Lien on the young Mr., purely through the face, hurting it and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the gunman wanted to make Mr. Lien harm or to settle a disagreement with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had consequences on the election directing the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe that the greatest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to notice how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead of that, the candidates have jousted with the plans for the public accommodation and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys his de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT has tendency to avoid parading his connections to the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from kindling the anti-Chinese feeling.
It is the reply to a new awareness according to which the Chinese firms are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
M. My, for his part, has claimed a confirmation for knowledge if his policy relative to China was satisfactory for the taiwanaise majority.
One can expect what the government of Beijing continues supply with the commercial easiness, in accordance with his strategy that aims at deceiving Taiwan, back at the fold.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Indeed, she would love to see also an integration political; but begin by the beginning.
Better is worth to expect for that after the presidential election from 2012.
The DPP is reinvented anyway itself.
Two years ago, it went badly: his previous leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent in prison with reference to accusations of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was an agitator in favor of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate has seen on the day under the direction of Mme Tsai and the PDP makes of everything use to attract the professionals and the youths.
Mme Tsai has been greeted as a candidate of the DPP for the presidency, as Known Tseng-chang, which has served Chen under Mr..
Their party is making of her better to show that he also can start with Beijing.
Mme Tsai has announced plans destined for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their maintenances can take place without preliminary conditions.
Mme Tsai tells to the taiwanais public that his party presents a "worthy alternative in trust" in relation to the fast approach of M. My about China.
M. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a declaration published from his cell, it has declared that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained of better results if they had stressed the fact that Taiwan is a distinct country.
Even he has organized to Mr. Su, a pragmatic, of not aspiring to the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have harm to choose potentials between his candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of himself.
The evaluations of M. My have been weak; in spite of a vertiginous economic growth, the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to make campaign with it.
His unpopularity seems to be in great part owed on welfare and to the broadening of the ditch between rich and poor.
One spokesperson of the KMT says that his office as his local antennae will be revised.
The good results of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the reconciliation is limited.
In the same time, most of the Taiwanais see the economic integration with China as unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorial writer, "the point of not return has already passed."
Nominations in the Grammy Awards: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "better new artist"
Carrying out at the request of a president, and the people are obliged to read.
Esperanza Spalding, the bass player of jazz and singer of 26 years caught by hand by the president Obama to happen during his ceremony of the price Nobel of the Peace in 2009, has stood out one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination of great wingspan in the category of the "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a face very known on the scene of the jazz from his album of 2008, "Esperanza," the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards according to which an artist must not take out more than three albums before the recording; what "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," probably has marked a step forward and, being given his lightly engaging vocal style, her skillful hand of pop and of funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to outline at least one line stippled to Spalding in relation to the success shining of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of the Grammy Awards taking into account the productions of jazz in this category these last years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have justly honored "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album," a drive on a shiver reviving of a recording that was one of the primordial favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the claviériste John Beasley will be notably in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favorite to the hoarse voice of the Nouvelle-Orléans and frequent guest to "Treme" of HBO, has been honored in the category of contemporary jazz; who bows besides strongly to a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiarized with the steampunk, has won some gratitudes well deserved in the high-density housing category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the adventurous eternality Dave Holland of which the album "Pathways" of her octet sec LIV was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bass player as leader of group.

The project of the mosque of Temecula takes away the approval of the commission of planning.
A project of mosque at Temecula has received the unanimous support of the commission of local planning after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The criticisms have blamed the project claiming that it made the promotion of the terrorism as well as of the traffic jams of the traffic.
But the commissioners have given a verdict Wednesday night that the new religious center respected the local laws and that it would be esthetically impressing.
"Many" people "well have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention it," has declared Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, taking the floor Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as American citizen."
"That shows that the justice carries it."
"The opposition is really minimal," it has added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session has begun at 18 hours and has lasted nearly until midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the center, in times of word more or less also distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate has continued web of the newspaper on the site.
"It is not more of America," has written a participant.
"It is a matter of another planet of the monkeys with Miss Liberty dead women in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers have also aroused protests in other parts of the country, including in the Ground Zero, place of the attacks of September 11th, 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families co-exists without incident in the county of Riverside for the years but it wanted one space greater and best than the warehouse that she has rented on a property for shared with a manufacturer of systems of filtration of water.
The new mosque of 24,943 feet squared to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and would rise at 43 feet of top.
It would occupy a site of 4,32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles to the east of the secondary school Chaparral.
The opponents can still make call against this project to the town council.
A microbe tolerating the arsenic lifts up the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use the arsenic as one of his nutritive elements, broadens the field to take on new ways of life on Earth and maybe au-delà.
Well that the researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that that shows that the life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered as main parts.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can him developed or with phosphorus, or with arsenic."
"It is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being a really "foreign" way of life, has commented on Paul Davies C. W. of the the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the relation appearing in the online edition of Thursday of the Science newspaper.
Six major elements have long been considered as main parts for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphorus and the sulfur.
But the researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in the lake Mono, in California, is in measure of continuing develop after having replaced the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," has declared Ariel Anbar D. de l'Université of State of Arizona, co-author of the relation.
The discovery is important as regards research of the life beyond the Earth because the researchers must be in a position to recognizing the life, of knowledge it that the life looks like, says Anbar.
The study concentrates on a microbe taken on on Earth.
Though, the announcement of a press conference to discuss some, who has not divulged the details of the find, has generated speculations spilled on the Internet according to which the relation could divulge the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That has not been the case.
The discovery "watch that, in other planetary environments, the organisms could be in a position to using other elements to activate the biochemistry and that the switchboard unity of the elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for the life, could not be set," has commented on Charles Cockell, teacher to the Institute of planetary scientific Research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the team of research.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element to another in fundamental biochemistry and of the biochemical structure," has added Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Institute of Astrology of the NASA, which has led the study, has chosen the lake Mono because it is endowed with levels raised from arsenic.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she has speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be in measure of substituting one for the other one.
"The arsenic is toxic principally because his chemical behavior is really similar to that of the phosphorus."
"As a result, the organisms have harm to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not work exactly as the phosphorus; it comes inside and, in a way, rubs out the work of our biochemical machine," has explained Anbar.
The researchers have gathered the bacterium known under the name of GFAJ-1 and have exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead lifts up the possibility that a way of life using the arsenic can happen naturally, or elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant teacher of microbiology at the University of Florida, has said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced with the phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that that could work.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, it says; thus, the researchers have expressed the hypothesis that the first ways of life would have been able to use it.
That suggests that it could have other ways as it to form the life, not only the way whose life on Earth has been formed initially," has declared Foster, which was not part of the team of research of Wolfe-Simon.
The research has been financed by NASA, the ministry of the Energy and the national Institute of the health.
The two last dogs of exhibition stolen have found to Compton
The two other dogs of exhibition on four stolen of the outside of a motel to Bellflower have been found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles have it anoncé Thursday.
The four dogs of exhibition - two akitas and two Welsh corgis pembroke - have disappeared Tuesday while somebody has stolen the van Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, have announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs have been recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others have been found in end of evening Wednesday, has declared to Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news, it is that the dogs are fine" said Whitmore.
"They are in good shapes."
"They have been restored to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore has refused to say precisely where the dogs had been taken on, in what area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An inquiry is in process."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore has said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, do not have not can to be joined to supply a comment Thursday.
They have been gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the county situated to Downey.
The assistants of the sheriff have found the van and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male of 3 years, and Didi, a female of 10 months - were healthy and unharmed, have announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show to regional competitions this week, for the account of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were carried disappeared up to their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, which lives at Redding, are this weekend downtown within the framework of the national championat "AKC/Eukanuba" of Length Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were waited for to participate in the competitions of other tests foreseen in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba," has declared Peek to the Times Wednesday.
The California of the South is one of the stoppings of the round of canine exhibition nearly of a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard have verified in the motel.
They remain often in the motels and park their van at the outside, just beside the window of their bedroom.
They have carried three other dogs - one puppy Boxer, a hole Parson Russell and a Breton spaniel - that have remained with them in the bedroom of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, at the thicker coat, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have opened the windows a bit, so that the dogs can have of the cool air.
Peek and Rickard have signaled the flight of the van at 6 hours Tuesday.
Peek has said that they would offer a reward to every person who could drive them to the corgis, provided with a microflea introduced to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM expects more only the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulences and of uncertainty, MGM has finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal judge of the bankruptcies of New York, officially has praised Thursday the plan " pre-packed" by the creditors according to which about 5 billion dollars of the debt would be erased; opening the way to the firm of diversion, having 86 years of existence, to concentrate his efforts on the production and the distribution of films and of TV programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan satisfies the particularities of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, more no legal obstacle do not subsist in front MGM to get back afloat under the guardianship of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executive officers of what will be a low-fat studio.
The staff will be brought back at about 320 on 400 to the departure.
MGM will not emerge really from the Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded a credit facility of 500 million from dollars, foreseen to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
Presently it is distributed under license by the bank of investment, which collides itself at 75 million dollars, and should be financed to the mid-December.
The process of restructuring of the studio has begun in May 2009 while the bank of investment Moelis & Co. has been engaged to recommend the direction on the way of putting his finances given that it did not have the means of paying the interests rising to 300 millions of dollars per annum.
At the month of August, the chief executive officer, Harry Sloan, has been replaced with Stephen Cooper, a previous PDG of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work by Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and of Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the studio have taken on a lot more time than be predicted.
After several months of discussions, the parts have admitted, at the end of 2009, to putting the society for sale.
Though, the auction has attracted few tenderers among whom none of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion furthermore whose creditors were to the research.
At the spring of this year, it was needed to redo everything even though the team of MGM had started working on a plan of restructuring that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, finally has been approved by the creditors at the end of October.
While MGM goes out officially from the bankruptcy in the next weeks, the firms Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which already has obtained 1,2 millions of dollars, will receive a payment of 9,5 million dollars.
The firms of Cooper, which have collected 375 000 $ by month for their services of direction of the firm, will receive a "bonus of success" of 4 millions of dollars.
Boring and Birnbaum intends to relaunch the production of MGM, who has taken out only one film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would go out from 2012.
They have also the intention of co-financing two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a distinct loan between $ 265 000 000 and $ 275 million to finance his part in these two films, which must be realized by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds 18% of the debt of MGM about, has tried to realize a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
Though, the recent discussions between the two societies have not led to an agreement.
Toys Tech to maintain your budget presents in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy of this year is the IPAD, followed, maybe, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, the two can make an important breach in your budget presents.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bikes BMX at 99 $ and that a game Kinect costs the same price that 10 skip ropes classic of pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping your budget presents in balance.
Lately, I have visited three national salesmen of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Ways and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than 80 $.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price otherwise a bit less, comparatively at the last year.
Moreover, even though there are generally less new toys associated with sites Web, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the toys to stacks button are on the increase, as the toys to reloadable stacks.
These are some recommendations.
(All the prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless contrary indication.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ for 3 years and more) are toys in plush of the size of a guinea pig that sing a bill while to hurry them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a bill, and one second allows composing a song.
If to buy you several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can not stop anymore.
To combine the singing for the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, 60 $ for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Being inspired by the technology of Elmo Live of the last year, the animatronique doll of 14 thumbs plays the games in turns as Simon Says and can make the dance lunar thanks to his articulate feet modernizing wheels with blocking.
The children that have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as instructor of dance even though their parents complain about a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the years 80, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, 40 $ for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with cards of questionnaire game conceived to transform a walk into car in a session with a self-correction and a file of gates.
If you are distrustful while your child keeps your smartphone, these are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech (60 $, for the 3 at 8 years) is the less expensive and the easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate so efficiently only to Explore it Leapster (70 $, for the 3 at 12 years) it is a matter of the first great review of the scale Leapster, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price (90 $, for the 3 at 7 years) uses a system of type iTunes to offer games and electronic books and is endowed with an entry for card SD that allows sticking up photos of family.
Finally, Flash Scrabble (30 $, Hasbro, for the 8 years and more) is a unity of five blocks hardly greater than a box of match, each possessing his own screen LED.
The objective is of forming words putting the online blocks before the time goes by, it is ideal for a sudden competition of spelling.
More and more, the toys have an online kind of connection.
Being based only on their presence in the stores of toys, the two greater ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an animal of online company of the Club Penguin, for example, you can obtain a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Pack Face Match, 5 $, for the 6 at 12 years) that includes a marked part of a hidden code.
While to purchase you the online code, your child receives sufficiently of credits to the store Club Penguin for two articles to the choices.
It can be a matter of roller skates or of an animal of toy company Puffle.
Hexbug Nano lightly greater than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the latter micro-robots to stack button.
The fake creature moves rapidly on 12 vibrating pastas in silicone in uncertain directions.
It is amusing to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can take on his path through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall of the table of the kitchen and even to a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a sweeter side to the maintenance of the order in China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place of the city as an urban sergeant to the training inspecting severely his nervous loads, expressing à voix basse orders with a military authority.
He wanted the feminine members of chengguan - imposing persons in charge of the public order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression and being inclined them for the violence - to transmit some impression to a unity of spectators.
"Do you hold out straight"!
"Be piercing"!
Show to them, it says, "like what the pretty girls look"!
Four girls having hardly spent the adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and in identical pants of olive color, congealed to the garde-à-vous.
Four pairs from black shoes to heel, lined up at the rule.
Four hats looked after perfectly perched at the summit of attached hair by a knot crossed in blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have an average appearance," has suggested Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to cool the picture of the urban inspectors of China.
A city has required that all the exhausted news has a diploma of superior study.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the gris-vert of the uniforms against a so-called blue engaging more.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux with the strong way:: in 2009, a relation has notified that 50 officers had encircled a cart to unverifiable snack bar launching black glances, firmly for a half-hour, until the peddler rewraps his businesses and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 of inhabitants at Chengdu, has chosen to make a great operation of picture.
For 2003, the district has completed his police of street in urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their curve and their young age.
The idea is of giving to the police polished a sweeter, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, same Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract the glance on this underground urban squad of China
And for cause, the criticisms will say.
Contrary to the police, these agents are allowed to only to make the municipal prescriptions respect imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei have beaten an observer at death after it has used his portable telephone to film them at dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a manual of training for the inspectors of Beijing, hidden and put online, describes how to defeat efficiently the delinquents without emitting of blood.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler of watermelons has been abandoned with a lésion cérébrale after a fight against five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by online downloading, watch of the Chinese inspectors formed to the assault of the salesmen of street.
"Chengguan has marked the government," has lamented the last year China Daily, a national publication, after a nth argues on the tactics.
The newspaper asked for a "real complete cleanup."
The skeptics say that the approach is well far.
After the district has passed an announcement in October to find eight exhausted news feminine, an editorial, seemed in The Beijing Evening News, has wondered if the women had of realities tasks or if they were only a touristic diversion.
The reply seems to be a bit of the two.
The announcement of the district required from the feminine, aged candidates between 18 to 22 years, of having a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the domestic order."
They must have a size superior to the average, or of 1,6 measure or 5 feet, 2 ½ thumbs.
The retirement at 26 years is compulsory.
The officers have declared that the work was physically too hard for the women of more than 25 years.
"It is their picture that is important," has told some officer of district to the Rednet.com, a Web site almost-governmental.
"First, the exterior qualities of the candidates will determine if they suit; it is a matter of the size, of the weight, of the features of the face, etc"
Afterwards come the disposition and the "interior qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are as of the vases to flowers, it has said, adding: "On top of being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, manager attached from the office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he has noticed that the particularities regarding the height were the standard norm in numerous Chinese job offers for the two sexes.
Such a is the case of the exigeance relative to the order of the features of the face.
That that means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Indeed, the handicapped or disfigured people must not postulate.
"We can not let a person who limps or a hunchbacked come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It would not give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the place Baoguang close to a monastery, is aged of 22 and has the finely curved dappled cheeks with a mouth.
She does not consider the appraisal of his appearance as being a sexist, said at-her.
"You think that I seem sexy in that regular"? has it asked of a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, her colleague to the dimples aged of 21 years, said: "Our work is of presenting the picture of the city."
They do not oppose what their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed greater ambitions of career than of simply driving away the salesmen to the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen of itinerant traders who move rapidly on foot or to bike, trying to sell the most possible of buns or of bowls of tofu before taking the escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have already told it to you several times"! , has suggested Mme Xu then that a salesman has escaped on foot, abandoning temporarily his bike-cart to noodles.
The agents describe their duties rather as monotonous that arduous.
"It is more or less the same one thing every day," has declared Huang Jing, aged of 20 years, who studies the marketing after the work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the feminine agents do not have the power of their male counterparts of confiscating the goods of the salesmen.
They can only threaten to signal the offenders to their male superiors.
That tends to protect them from the public exhibitions sudden of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common in the whole China.
This year, of the hundred citizens to Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, have rebelled after the propagation of fake rumors according to which the agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman.
In a night, more than one dozen policemen and agents of the chengguan have been hurt, 14 vehicles of the government have been knocked over or put to fire.
Xindu has so far gotten away to such a violence.
But the quietness is hardly guaranteed.
Just two city blocks of the placid one place Baoguang, where the officers of feminine sex patrolled that morning, more than 50 people have gathered to the corner of the street.
The agents have confiscated a motorbike that was at being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as theirs imposing the rules.
The owner of the motorbike cried to the scandal.
An arm-wrestling of 15 minutes has followed before that the policemen, to the sinister face, he be cleared a path through elbow to their vehicle and have left to every speed with the motorbike and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a co-organizer attached to the male team, has remained behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
As the officers of feminine sex, the coordinators - men aged of 40 years or more play purely a role of support.
Contrary to them, they are not formed with a view to maintaining a polished picture.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," suggests Mr. Li said of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public that begins."
The prosecutors will not accuse the senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the ministry of the Justice have raised the criminal accusations carried on the senator John Ensign, following of a business related to an assistant of an old campaign and to his efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband from the woman, have anoncé Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
The decision takes end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada that a possible republican candidate for the presidential one of 2012 was considered until the scandal around his business does not make the headlines national last year and harm his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign has declared that it was "very happy" by the decision, result of an inquiry of a year.
The senator could still be exposed to busy disciplinary measures by the senatorial committee of ethics.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign have declared that the ministry of the Justice had "informed that the senator Ensign was not the subject to the inquiry anymore and that it did not have the intention of maintaining of indifferent accusation against it in this business."
The ministry of the Justice has refrained from comment on that subject.
The announcement has come as a sort of surprise for numerous lawyers of ethics exterior to the ministry of the Justice, according to which indicating significant proofs would be than Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on the lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first communiqués in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped to Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a work from lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and of his wife, Cynthia, about the business of the senator with it.
Mme Hampton has once served as treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
M. Ensign has contacted some number of political backers to take on work for Mr. Hampton and, afterwards, it has defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them; in accordance with the documents and to the interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had lately been a colleague of Mr. Ensign, it was forbidden for a year to him by the law of making lobbying next to his previous employer or of the Senate in his unity.
The experts in ethics have maintained that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the business, seems in contradiction with the ban said of the revolving door of the lobbying.
According to the proof that has been made public, "it seems to have a proof as it outdid facie of a plot with a view to violating and of substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," has declared Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specializes in the defense of customers of an inquiry by the government.
Although the judge of the ministry has refused to explain the reasoning having driven Ensign to the decision to the business, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics have said that the ministry seemed to mistrust the political pursuits after some number of taken backs of high level by his section of the public integrity, including the decision taken the last year of abandoning the pursuits against the previous senator Ted Stevens marked of mistake of pursuit.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking the weapons, has declared Melanie Sloan, the general manager of the citizens for the responsibility and the ethics in Washington, a group of defense that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the business.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now accepts the laws don you apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main lawyer of Mr. Ensign, has declared in an interview that it had received on the Monday a telephone call on behalf of a prosecutor of the ministry of the Justice and a follow-up the day after, saying it that the ministry did not look for accusations against his customer.
The team of lawyers of Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, such than his office has reaffirmed it Wednesday in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
M. Coggins has refused to clarify the legal arguments that it had made to the parquet.
"I am not comfortably of entering to the details of my discussions with the ministry of the Justice, except for statement that we think that they have made the good decision," at-it says.
Last month, the federal Commission of the Elections has decided to abandon an inquiry with reference to an independent complaint by the group of ethics, maintaining that the payment of 96.000 $ by the parents of Mr. Ensign at the Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission has declared that it did not have sufficiently proofs to prove that the money was everything except a present.
NV Energy, an important society of the Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a firm for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find work of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 has shown that, after the firm has received Mr. Hampton as lobbyiste, the leader of office of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, has communicated with Mr. Hampton and has told him that it "hammered" the ministry of the Inside on a question in dispute.
M. Ensign also has participated in a breakfast with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he has asked to the secretary for transport of setting a meeting on behalf of the airline after having encouraged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying.
When the news of the business has made surface the last year, Mr. Ensign has apologized next to his voters and has resigned from his post of leader to the fourth republican row to the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign declared two weeks ago that it had the intention of aspiring to a third mandate to the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was not more the target of a criminal inquiry, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, has declared that the senator hoped that the committee of ethics would follow rapidly the example of the ministry of the Justice and would put thin to his inquiry.
The senator Ensign looks forward to hounding his fierce work on behalf of the people with Nevada, it says.
The call of Cheshire will point at Twitter
A half-a-doz out of them were hitting in the distance in the lines of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the relations of horrible testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense has said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial about the business of rape and the children attached to their bed in a house that fire has been set to.
Thursday, the trial largely followed from Steven J. Hayes, who has been pleaded guilty of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, in Connecticut, should lead on to an official end that the judge would impose the death penalty, voted for by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already to put down elements to the court that outline arguments of call, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative, it is that the intense reports on the trial - as the use generalized and stretched by the journalists of the Twitter - have created an "atmosphere of circus," one saturation so widespread and instant with incendiary details that the jury badly has been influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could drive the judges of call to discuss knowledge on the question if the new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have made some the experience during this trial; I think that it is a real danger, the introduction of the new technologies in the courtrooms portal reached to the rights of the person to an equitable trial," has declared Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, leader lawyer.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Bleue de la Cour superior of State, laconically has thrown back the claims in the sentence given back the last week, maintaining that the media were "tidily controlled" and that there was not any proof according to which the jury would have been livened up by the passion.
But that it does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The courts of appeal recognize for decades that the media blanket the notorious cases can lift up of the questions on the equity of a trial.
In a sentence of 1966 that has made date, the High Court of the United States has canceled the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his woman, maintaining in his decision that there was an "atmosphere of carnival to the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some of having been the inspiration for the TV program and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers have declared that the courts of call seized to revise a half century more late the conviction of Mr. Hayes can be curious being given the argument according to which of new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard.
"It is a general reason of worrying about the impact of the new media" in the trials of great wingspan, has declared John J. Donohue III, a teacher to the school of Right of Stanford that has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and has written a relation according to which it has arbitrarily been applied.
The teacher Donohue maintains that some judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of the instant communication from the courtrooms could allow trials fairer.
The case of Twitter is only a among of numerous other described by the lawyers of Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; what delays the execution.
The defense counsels assert also, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a damage while the judge Blue has refused to allow them to put the reactions of the potential jurors to the test showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors have declared to have been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and his girls, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defense counsels maintain that they go also to contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the juror, who had been a criticism in front of the prosecutors, and that excessively he has put the pressure for a verdict making the unusual decision of leading the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors have not been sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media blanket of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They have noticed in a protest against the verdict, put down the last month, which the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and which it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the post of governor and to the Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the computer media did not stop kindling the flames of the emotion of the business.
"The daily hustle of the tweets of the media, of the cameras and of the journalists in front of the palace of justice," wrote the lawyers, "did not look like anything of what has had been seen beforehand here, to New Haven, and maybe even to the national ladder."
Their accent on the blanket of the system Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists have declared that the assertion, according to which the instant news was more incendiar than the communiqués replaced more slowly, was a luddiste sight that would impoverish the policy of the Court governing the media blanket of the future trials.
But some lawyers have declared that the étaitent courts of appeal often attracted by the arguments according to which the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes stress this claim.
In their file, they make a reference to the decision of the High Court of 1966 that had knocked over the conviction of Dr Sheppard because of the media blanket of the trial and they have clarified that they would invoke the need of new rules for the new media.
"This business," écrivaient-ils,"représente that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can the civility approach the cleavages?
After a campaign marked by the abuse and the négativité, a minimum of civility has burst this week in Washington.
Is it a matter of a precursory sign of a real bipartite cooperation to the front or of an illusory moment before the fast return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Conference has not produced any breakthrough on the great questions that must be treated in the course of the session of the "lame duck."
But of every obviousness, at least there has been a polite discussion on the differences of the two parts as on the gratitude of their responsibilities shared to govern, rather than another episode where every camp wanted to mark points. space of notation not partisan.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the president has been tout aussi civilized, in spite of the political divergences that remain between the members.
It seems light that the narrow interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological ditch; but who, though, divides still the members.
It is hardly sufficing to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parts are now in a period of testing and of mutual assessment with a view to obtaining signs from cooperation and from compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and of the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
It is why the meeting of Tuesday and the ulterior comments of the participants have unveiled a minimum of particularities or of accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a fast change in the climate that has existed in the course of the two last years.
What it is a matter of the tax system, expenses, care of health or the rights, the two parts remain at miles of distance.
Nevertheless, the election of November had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"It does not make any doubt that the things have changed on the tone," has declared Pete Wehner, an official of the administration Bush, now at the side of the Center of ethical Policy and public.
"It is unavoidable after the elections.
The elections arouse partisan passions and, afterwards, they him estomptent.
It is well."
On some questions, notably those on the agenda of the session of "lame duck," the republicans and the democrats do not have other choice only of finding a solution.
The fiscal reductions of Bush will exhale at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of that.
The two parts want to find a way of protecting a part or the unity, of permanent or temporary way.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the stretching of the allocations of unemployment, it would not be that because the republicans can not allow to themselves to give the impression that they are in favor of the reductions of taxes for the wealthy persons while refusing the workers the compensations of unemployment without job.
After the meeting of Tuesday in the White House, more optimism hovers on a possible agreement about the questions evoked in the course of the session relative to the "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns of a fruitful cooperation on the most urgent problems of the session "piercing duck" not ménera not inevitably to a better harmony between the two parties while the 112th conference will merge into January.
Instead of that, it says, a period of disagreement is probable, indeed unavoidable.
"Once the things that must be made will be it, the psychology in the short term will fall to one of the confrontations," it has said.
Wehner also has expressed his skepticism largely divided according to which the civility would drive to a real cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing in relation to the main event of 2012, at-it says.
The reasons are narrowly related to the composition of the new republican majority to the Bedroom and to the voters present at the tea who have contributed to his creation.
Though the republican leaders are conscious of the dangers if they go too much far, they know that they must try to be up to their promises of reducing the public expenditures and of repealing the new law on the care of health.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit that include to reform the code of taxation and to increase some taxes, to reject the retiring age and to reduce the expenses.
The co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the question of the deficit on the public agenda of a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 voices on commission, composed of 18 members, to emit their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had harm to reach this number.
The greatest resistance subsists among the elected representatives of the group; it that suggests that few reasons or will of compromise is on the fiscal questions, at least today.
Galston foresees two stages in the fightings between the White House and the republicans of the Conference.
The first will come of taxes and of care of health the next year under the form of partisan confrontations, given that the republicans contest Obama as regards budget; to be followed afterwards by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
Largely it is proved that, in spite of the mind partisan of the recent election, a majority of Americans wants always to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will observe the reaction of the public attentively.
The one that will be judged in loss will have to change cape and take on compromises.
But nevertheless it would be an optimistic viewpoint.
The partisan mind and the polarization are bigger today that they were not it in the middle of the years 1990 and it seems to have one as it more ideological splits between Obama and the republicans of the Conference that was not then between the president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
In the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a simple one preludes a more consistent election in 2012.
Considering this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by numerous Americans.
But many more efforts on behalf of the two parts will be needed to find a ground of harmony on the questions that still divide them.
Divulged American documents describe Moscow as a haven of the corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes to pass a part of the containers up to the Kremlin-of-wine and of the money of protection that it gathers, has signaled the embassy of the United States in Russia in a bill in February.
The police and the federal Service of safety realize enormous rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow, it has said.
They gather money not only of legitimate firms but also of organized criminal groups.
Every coat of the bureaucracy - it that the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine has called the "vertical of the power" - takes his part even though the money follows its course upwards of the ladder.
The bill on duty, who has been sent in Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, has been posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his Web site.
The bill is based on sources whose names have been expurgated.
It has been written even though Iouri Loujkov was still a mayor of Moscow; and it is in great part kept responsible for the corruption.
He has been dismissed in October by the president Dmitri Medvedev but there are for had lors few traces of cleanup.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who possesses a building firm of foreground, always have denied the accusations of corruption in the course of the years; and it has won several trials in slandering on these accusations.
In September, he has declared what follows Russian at a television channel, while he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that it was corrupted: "It is mad, it is to be thrown, it is anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to the surveys.
But finding the information stated in a review of embassy is unusual; and conceiving that it would belong to diplomats of a foreign country to make it is unprecedented.
The established direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and the crime has driven some people to appoint him of "dysfonctionnel" and to maintain that the government worked more as a kleptocratie that a government," according to the bill of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoy one" krysha " (term used in the criminal world/the mafia that means literally" roof "or protection) that passes across the police, the federal Service of safety (FSB), the ministry of the Inside (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as through all the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts of identifying a structure with three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the summit."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the corrupted inspectors find themselves the lowest at the level."
"It is a matter of an ineffective system in which the criminal groups height a space in some domains where the city does not supply some services."
The relation indicates that the FSB mixes the money of the greatest firms and that civilizes it target the small ones.
A source, it has said, "explained that the owners of firm of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection from the MVD and from the FSB (rather that of the groups of the organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than the criminal groups but also they are protected by the law. "
"It is the reason for which the request of protection by the criminal gangs is not anymore also raised."
The bill notifies that, although the collection of the money is extensive, the protection itself can be unequal; even those that pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those that do not pay rapidly see their businesses close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has evoked several times the fight against the corruption but he has admitted the little progress.
The bill of the embassy transmits accounts-returns making state of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, up to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against the corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," has declared in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, manager of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because there is not some in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of the powers, it has said, the corruption is unavoidable.
According to the Indem, the costs of the corruption would rise, to the ladder of Russia all whole, at more than 300 billion dollars per annum.
The country has been classified 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least to the most corrupted).
The divulging of the bill of the American embassy, which does not have was realized that yesterday, late in the evening, hour of Moscow, will move with certainty dissatisfactions within the Russian government; although Loujkov can be blamed, to a certain extent, for the chess of Moscow, showing that it is solving the problem could be the occasion for the Kremlin.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Poutine has emitted the hypothesis that the documents of WikiLeaks could be a fabrication and has reacted with anger in the face of the intentions that diplomats of the United States had divulged calling it Batman and approaching Medvedev of Lawyer.
"The problem rests on the fact that it is a matter of our interaction, important factor of the interior policy in this country, it says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be realized with such an arrogance, such a pressure and, you know it, in opposition to the ethics."
The previous combatants of the red Khmers obliged to face the past
In a classroom badly lit up with decrepit walls in concrete of bad quality, the manager of the secondary school of Anlong Veng has evoked the man who had built it, the last leader of the red Khmers, Your Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," has declared Sreng Kor Ma, aged of 42 years.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, while it was at the head of the red Khmers, this major remains popular in this isolated bastion of old red Khmers to the northwest of the Cambodia where it has made to build hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where do thousands of previous soldiers of the organization live still today.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmers have surrendered to the government, the loyalty of long date is finally questioning in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and of reconciliation has allowed to the victims to face publicly to the people who had participated in the system.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school that, for the first time, teaches the history of the red Khmers to the children of his previous soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, has pronounced his first sentence regarding a previous member of the red Khmers, condemning the previous leader of the sadly famous center of torture of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, at 35 years of prison, better experienced under the name "Duch."
In the face of this evolution of the situation, the anxiety has increased next to the previous combatants in the red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills of reintegrating itself in the Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the old red Khmers but they are powerless to make that that it is," has declared Chhang Youk, manager of the Center of documentation of Cambodia, an independent organism that takes investigations on the system.
"For them, the life under the red Khmers was glorious but the system has become a symbol of the harm."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the reign of the red Khmers in the Cambodia, of 1975 to 1979, about 1,7 million people have been executed or are dead of hunger, of illness or of overwork.
While the Vietnamese have invaded and knocked over the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the system and his army have run away to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurrection that has lasted until the latter of the movements is given back in December 1998.
Even though Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla warfare from their base situated in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Your Mok prepared one with reference to Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the years 1990, after an agreement of peace sponsored by the UN has driven to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, great groups of red Khmers combatants have started making desertion to the government, towering with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and of Nuon Chea and of Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot is a death of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had kept head, has been captured by the governmental strengths in 1999 in the mountains close to Dangrek.
It has died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the previous red khmers combatants have sunk in the black, common misery at the rural regions of Cambodia; and numerous are those that remain nostalgic of the movement.
Well that some red khmers officers of elite have kept their posts of local leader in return for having put down the weapons, it is a matter of farmers not qualified at the weak rank and file.
"These people have benefited of very little of follow-up after the capitulation," has declared Sok Leang du Centre for the justice and the reconciliation that organizes public forums in every Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are impregnated with the agrarian utopian ideology of the system."
"They have been raised in a frame where to make businesses is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged of 55 years, who has joined the red Khmers as adolescent in 1974, has fought in the jungle goshawk of Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor farmer of rice.
"The life under the red Khmers was good," it has said.
"Your Mok feeds everybody."
But now, the life is difficult because we must provide for our own needs."
The court of the red Khmers underway has also caused worries here.
The court would owe, at the beginning of the next year, to start the sentence of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and of his wife, Ieng Thirith, another previous red khmer minister.
The mandate of the court is of judging the leading tops and the main persons in charge of the crimes but he has not said if he continued beyond these four cases.
Some would be needed more to soothe the fears in Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations have turned to Im Chaem, aged of 64 years, previous leader of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the red Khmers in the years 1970.
In 2007, she has told the researchers of the Center of documentation of Cambodia that she had supervised the building of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced workers would have taken on the death.
Lately, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem came back of the work to the field situated close to his house in wood on stilts, on a path of earth outside of Anlong Veng.
Even though the sun threw long shades on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss of his past within the red Khmers.
If the court convoked it, it says, it would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," said at-her.
"If there are more pursuits, the war will be."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has made desertion of the Khmers reds in 1978, also has warned on several occasions of an instability happening if the court pursued several suspects; although the experts and the historians contest that.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and to bury the past, at-it says.
But to face the past is all what Cambodia must make to go of the front, said Youk Chhang, of the center of documentation.
"The reconciliation in terms khmer is of reconnecting the broken pieces, it says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The center has produced the first manual approved of by the government on the red Khmers, "A history of the Kampuchea démocratique, compound of 75 pages."
He has distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as supplement at the manuals of history of the ministry of the Education, conceived for the high schools, which contained less than four pages on the red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the youths of Anlong Veng know only some details on the red Khmers, in spite of the links of the city to the system.
Touch Valeak, aged of 19 years, studying at the high school of Anlong Veng, has declared that the new manual helped the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when it has come back with the book at home to study.
"My family throws back numerous parts of the manual and the court," it says.
"They mistrust because they do not know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such a resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, has declared Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court start having an impact, at-it says.
Nevertheless, the red Khmers preserve a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the bad herbs and scattered with plastic bags, canal up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of sheet metal rusty.
The body of Pol Pot has been burned here on a stack of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged of 31 years, saleswoman of portable telephone in edge of road, has said that she did not know some much on the man who has been incinerated to this place.
"But it has a great mind; and numerous inhabitants go there to pray, it says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, more late that day, it has planned to walk to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where it would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope to bring of the luck.
Belorussia accepts to renounce his stock of uranium of military quality
The government of Belorussia has announced Wednesday that it was going to abandon his stock of uranium highly enriched, a component essential for the nuclear weapons; this décison registers itself within the framework of a victory discovered from the campaign of the president Obama to secure the nuclear matters in the whole world
The agreement has been divulged in a linked communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has met the Belorussian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov here, in margin of a summit on the safety.
The American government had tried for years of persuading Belorussia to renounce the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have brought out the horizon at the last spring.
But the American persons in charge have declared to the Washington Post that some classified operations have been realized with Belorussia in the course of the two last months to eliminate 187 pounds of the uranium of military quality from a center of research of Belorussia.
That has opened the way to an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 books, according to an official who has evoked the condition of the anonymity because of the sensibility of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Summit of nuclear Safety of 47 nations, organized to the initiative of Obama; where was Belorussia excluded.
Apparently, it has been beneficial to obtain an invitation at the Soviet ex-republic subsequent to the summit, in 2012.
"Really I am fascinated by the fact that they want a seat to the Summit of nuclear Safety of 2012 nuclear Summit of safety."
"That proves to me that this process works," has declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for the world safety, a group of promotion of the nuclear safety.
Clinton has described the agreement "as very significant, important stage" realized by Belorussia.
Obama has committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all the vulnerable nuclear matters across the world in the four years to come.
For lors, the American government has helped six countries to dispose of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have made it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Summit on the nuclear safety of Obama, the Belorussian president, Alexandre Loukachenko, has declared that the nation would never renounce his uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, of the hundred kilogrammes of what is uranium of military quality and weakly enriched uranium mainly," has called then Mr. Loukachenko.
"It is our product... We are not going to produce dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell it to anybody."
"We are going to use it at ends of research, it is everything."
Belorussia approached the United States some months ago; however, showing interest to get to an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Belorussia, in October, particularly has been complicated because the material had lightly been irradiated, have indicated persons in charge.
It has been loaded on a special train that has gone over more than 1 300 miles up to an installation in Russia to be stocked and eliminated, have indicated persons in charge.
The second operation has been finished Monday and has been realized by airplane, according to the persons in charge.
The American government has spent 13 million dollars in his efforts, in great part to replace the installations of research of Belorussia with weakly enriched uranium; maladjusted person for the weapons.
"A meticulous coordination and organization have been made of use with a view to reinforcing the trust"; driving thus to the agreement signed by Clinton, has declared Andrew Bieniawski, a person in charge of the department of the energy specialized in the Reduction of the world Threat.
According to the appraisals of the Center of Study of Nonproliferation James Martin, Belorussia had this year at least 88 pounds of uranium of military quality, as of the hundred kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belorussia tries to eliminate his stocks of here at 2012, according to a linked declaration.
The relationships between Belorussia and the United States are tightened for years, principally because of the hard repression through Loukachenko des Droits de l'Homme.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"All congratulating oneself progress on these questions of world safety, the United States and Belorussia has recognized that an increased respect for the democracy and the Human Rights in Belorussia remained essential to improve the bilateral relationships; and essential to the progress of the country and of his citizens," it has declared.
The government has not expressed any objection to the flights of the CIA
The government has not expressed any objection to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and of Al Qaeda in direction Guantanamo has shortcoming of the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
That is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cable) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive is informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised an appropriate vigilance on the foreign airplanes that crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a relation of the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in contrary practices to the human rights to a dozen countries, among which Spain, has taken place a meeting between the previous American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president has admitted that the relation of the Advice "had surprised the Government of Zapatero hors-jeu" and has stressed the fact that Spain did not have anything as it to hide.
"Of the Vega has underlined that Spain does not have objection in what concerns the flights of intelligence by top of the Spanish territory."
"They want only to be informed" to avoid that "one takes them by surprise," relates Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Day Pupil of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, has notified to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this business shapes it more possible bottom, even if, as it was judges to the hands, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
Successively, at the month of January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González has transmitted to the Embassy the fact that it was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the displacement of the documents of the Center National of Intelligence (CNI) and of the ministry of the Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These relations do not contain no incriminating element, any sensitive information," has explained the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless the United States have shown their worry for "the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the ministry of the Defense.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case discreetly between the Governments," regrets Aguirre.
At the month of March of 2007 during a breakfast between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Internes, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this has commented it that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and they will make appropriate what they consider," it had given instructions to his colleagues "so that they avoid the comments of a rhetoric set fire to, trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador expresses also his worry for the action of the PP in this business.
"In spite of his pro-American general direction, our experience suggests the fact that PP probably will pull left of any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights, those revelations there have of the negative consequences for the Government of the United States," it signals.

After the important increase of votes and deputies recorded in the latter elections autonomiques, the PP Catalan already has aimed the general ones because, even if there is progress or not, the perspectives are more than are positive, because the number of votes that this training obtains in these fairs doubles in a normal way the one that it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the Catalan popular ones have obtained 610.473 vote to the general ones of 2008, while to the autonomiques of 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
On the past Sunday, the PPC has obtained 384.091 votes.
If one maintains this rising tendency, wanted of a diversion of votes of the PSC and the development of loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this training have calculated the fact that, if general elections were, the PPC would be able past of 8 to 12 deputies in the Conference, while CiU would win also four (it has 10 now) and PSC would lose some neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculate would notice that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose a deputy - it has three maintaining - while ICV would keep a deputy or would win one.
But if the agenda electoral is maintained itself, the most next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the fairs municipal, where the popular ones can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and in their intermediary at the head of the Department Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the budget higher - 661 million euros for 2011.
So much the nationalists as the popular ones are agreed with the fact that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account of the collapse republican, it would not be fanciful that this training loses his representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% from the votes.
The PP has increased his number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive strength in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the present socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
To Lérida, the PP has registered only a difference of 500 votes in relation to PSC, of which the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have met themselves several times.
The popular ones have recorded progress also in other municipalities important as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to forming lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated Al Qaida thousands of passports
Apart from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there have been three
The seven Pakistani ones and the Nigerien one held by agents of the General police station of Information of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadiste cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaida, among which "The Tigers for the Release of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the attacks of Bombay that has caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Boarders has given a great importance to these investigations, to the point of checking on the fact that with "the operation Kampai" "has been weakened" the device of falsification of Al Qaida at international level and "consequently, his opérative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it has been active in Catalonia, has been able messenger of the thousand passports in Thailand, or they were falsified and then were distributed to the groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that his "combatants" can pass the borders European and of other countries western with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadiste network kept opérative in Europe, it is for that that in the investigations have participated, apart from services Thai, of other European police unity, it is why in the territory of the European Union the next days of the similar blows could be to that registered the night of the Tuesday spent in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (one has held the Pakistani ones Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerien one Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand one has unwound another, with the capture of the Pakistani ones Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai one Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
Them were those that led from Bangkok the cell introduced in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - whose one part has been struck in 2009 - flew principally of the tourists the passports that satisfied the conditions marked by the one appointed "Islamic World Forehead."
It is-to to say the documents had to be to name of teenager aged men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
The investigators underline that until now one has not found any detail that connects the prisoners in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the receiving groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless the fact must be reminded that some days before that this attack or committed, of Catalonia one has sent across an agency of transfers some milles of dollars that "have been surrounded" to buy cards of motives that have been used after by the integrating ones of the "commando" that has killed 106 people.
The Police has seized itself of a plentiful documentation.
PP asks in Mas that he suspends the fiscal complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, has had the occasion yesterday of setting forth personally his conditions to Artur Mas to press his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to the those exposed during the campaign and that amount to give priority to the recovery of the economics and the philo-souverainistes lack of adventures as the economic complicity is which the nationalist leader wants to approach at the half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular ones has arrived to the appointment with Artur Mas with the safety that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies to the elections on the past Sunday, a number more that sufficing to make itself to love, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the trainings that will exercise the oppositions abstains itself in the votation of the investiture.
Of a possible harmony with the PP depend the future alliances which the nationalists want to maintain in the Conference during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Farmhouse has these days with the rest of political leaders make to themselves in Catalan key.
And in what concerns the president of the PP, to press an investiture "all the speeches souverainistes and freedom fighters" would have to be eliminated," and the economic - similar complicity to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to subject even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make lose weight the political device of a very exaggerated autonomique administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and settlements.
Details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be occupied on behalf of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will be it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric one maintains that the dead have not been owed to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that their nurse by night has killed more than 11 aged people
The persons in charge of the geriatric one La Caritat of Olot (Gérone) have offered yesterday a press conference to underline the damages caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who has killed at least eleven aged people of whom it was responsible in the space that he has worked on it.
The manager of the residence, Joan Sala, has appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and has announced that "the desire for La Caritat would be that of being able to exercise the accusation against the person in charge" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige to us to accept the processuelle situation of civil persons in charge."
And apart from social discréditation that the entity can suffer not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the nurse by night, the great threat for La Caritat takes now the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to the August 2009 and that from that day it has not stopped killing.
The judge has mentioned in the sentence that he organized the exhumation of eight bodies - previous patients of the geriatric one - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor explored personally the dead ones but, being given the age and the pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through his manager, has denied categorically yesterday this situation and has mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been in any moment the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat has added that "in this business there is only a clue of carelessness on behalf of any other person that is not the defendant."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" has confessed avant-hier to 11 murders and has detailed that he has committed the first crime on August 29th, 2009 and a month and a half later it has killed a second grandmother.
In that case it has caused it the death in it injecting a sobre-dose of insulin, to difference of the first crime that he had committed with one mix of sedative lozenges.
The manager of La Caritat has mentioned the fact that controlling the access of the staff of the center to the medicines is complicated.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the boarders, used to kill them.
But the analyses of laboratory will clarify if Vila does not lie saying that he has looked for his first victims for a death less cruel or by opposite it has burned them inside giving them washing powder as already he has confessed that it has made with the three women that it has killed in the space 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the declarations of the nurse by night, not more the avowed number of murders, they do not eliminate the possibility of that the number is more big and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has fallen into his visits to the County Court and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having committed eight murders with success.
It is for that that they declare that they will remain à disposition justice to clarify the range of the facts.
BCE threatens
The investors have reacts brusquely yesterday to the threat of yesterday of Trichet that warned that "the markets must not underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of the beltways have orchard at the strength and the actions of the banks European have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we do not owe either to underestimate the capacity of BCE of making a mistake and the euro hardly has recorded one increment, what is a concerned signal.
What has happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative fences of positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time in losing the fear.
A month ago, BCE has quoted us today to withdraw measures from liquidity and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank required the finalisation of the plan of purchase of public debt because of his inefficiency and the elimination of all the extraordinary measures of liquidity eventually and leaving only access unlimited at the week.
After the Irish crisis let's hope that one prolongs the present measures of liquidity "at least until the March" and maintains the quarterly auction to unlimited access at the end of the term to guarantee the liquidity at least until the month of June.
We hope that one will continue with the program of purchase of obligations and that one falls same the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not fulfill the generated states of uncertainty, they will knock over the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the measures from liquidity, which God helps us!
As during their meeting of the month of May in which they have maintained that they had not even envisaged the purchase of obligations and they have collapsé the markets, the history would be able itself to repeat tomorrow.
BCE must be believable and persistent.
At the month of May it has announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he has said that he had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the bid of drafts at a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasure has emitted only 500 million at the 5,28% in relation to 750 million at the previous 4,81% of the bid.
Even thus, the types in Portugal have lowered 30 points of base in the whole one curved, and reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland one has published the numbers of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The numbers valued represent 10.000 million in the short term and 15.000 potentials and they have a deadline until the February to obtain from the private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland does not have any credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the testing of stress, the numbers are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce of uncertainty.
Nevertheless, on the next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval from his new budget and it does not have yet a sufficient support, consequently Ireland stays in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to relaxing the tension before the next Summit of the Heads of State and of Government on December 14th in which it is necessary to find a compromise talks about politics who demonstrates that we are a union and that we interpret everyone the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president has had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve of Friday.
Re-forms of the pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measure to reactivate the job ring to the hearings of the investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock-Exchange has undergone the 4.5%, doubles it that the rest of the European Stock-Exchanges.
To difference of February, the reaction of the Government and of the Bank of Spain has been fast and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is one bid-key of an obligation at three years that be benefited by the effect Trichet, consequently we hope that this turns with a strong request and helps to dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasure has more than 40.000 million in available liquidity, the treble in relation to March, to very expensive types and they cut the access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue be that of the wife of Caesar, "apart from of being it, to seem it."
Courage, we can put through!
The president of Eulen will contest the advice of Vega Sicilia asked for by his sons
The storm does not stop in the conflict opened in the breast of the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he does not consider it "any by right," the judicial advice of El Enebro the neighbor 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to bring out their majority and to seize the organs of management of the holder firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José bring together their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control on the one hand of the group.
The founder of the greater holding company of services of businesses for the companies does not seem to be disposed to give in in his dispute to be present in the organs of direction of El Enebro.
Of his board of directors he has been excluded by five of his seven sons that have been called administrators in the assembly of the shareholders of January 18th this year of which the protest is recorded to the Register of the Business and of the Societies.
The judicial advice of El Enebro for the neighbor 16, convoked by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunders within the family Álvarez.
The resort to the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict turns, the only mechanism that guaranteed the summoning of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate resort of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, has shortcoming a processuelle quibble, defrauding clearly the Law and abusing the right, of validating and correcting the assembly radically none on January 18th," according to her door-words officials.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once the assembly takes place, is contested considering that this is "none of right fullness."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success as the magistrate convokes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, one patrimonial society and Bodegas Vega Sicilia holder, among others active, the sons of David Álvarez control the 100% of the capital.
Nevertheless the founder of the group of services solicits the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This business is the question of bottom that the judge must decide after the audience on the request of protest for which still a signal date is not.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on the cars in time real.
As soon as Red Bull have gone in the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in it selects universe the speed has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment, nobody has had in account the options from a new stable that had just happened, in spite of the rising path of the latter seasons, the past November, in the last stage of the championship them have everyone bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skilfulness as pilot of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, either the capacity of the motor Renault that propels his car, in the world of the Formula 1 one talks about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put to the hands of Red Bull to transform it in one winning team.
It is in reality a matter of a powerful software of simulation of process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high motor competition.
Appointed PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create chaines of assembly of the manufacturer factories of everybody, of the stations of energy, of the instruments of high precision.
The objective is to reproduce, to feign faithfully the product or the process before building it in a real way, avoiding thus the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the devices photo of Canon, of the airplanes of Sukhoi or of the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in his factory of Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull of creating and carrying out "in few hours, nearly in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and testings.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams that was capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles every season.
In the team of Red Bull work today 180 professional youths of high qualification that, equipped with powerful equipment computings analyze and project everything kind of modifications on the racing cars.
The leader of Siemens has explained that the software PLM is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the racing cars of Red Bull excepted the motor, which is responsibility exclusive of Renault.
One modifies the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of safety.
The changes can pass from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to systems brought forward from production by laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As unique limitation of this madness of the technological improvement there is the amount of 40 million dollars that every team of Formula 1 can spend every season as limit to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has introduced the factory of high technology to create and to produce his racing cars in a locality at 50 kilometers of London.
They are two buildings where the visits, especially for the journalists, are limited.
All what happens over there is considered "secret beep."
The staff for this duty counts 580 people, ci-inclus two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The héro of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energetic drinks has puts to the service of his participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, of which the activity is inestimable and the reputation none.
The manager of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, maintains that one could maintain five years ago that the progress of R+D in the case of cars of races brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were a person in charge of the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents the 85% of the success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey confesses that the Vettel or Webber never will be replaced with the computing, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."

The American group has prepared a plan to introduce 200 points of sale of brand in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open ones have been those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero has not wanted to reveal the neighbors possible stores, even if she has confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The manager of HM personal systems has insured person that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will be always the same one, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group recommends and takes care of the conception of the furniture exclusive of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will keep a picture identical.
Furthermore, HP covers the staff training with the establishments.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a system of frankness and has underlined that the network exclusive of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to the customers and to the PMEs in the purchase, the assistance, post-is it windy and even the wrapping."

Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers from his rivals in three years
More optimistic that of other leaders, the delegated administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a year hard for the banking sector, but throws back initially a new crisis of liquidity and foretells the end of the war of the debit.
In spite of that, it foresees a collapse of the margins of the interests, which one will try to compensate partially with increments of the commissions and of the price of the credit.
Sabadell wait to win in three years a million particular customers, his task to fulfill.
Sabadell has taken on a way to exploit for the three futures years and to be able to survive thus in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will put in walk in 2011 a new master plan that will keep one goes labilité of three years.
The objective, apart from of surviving the public grants of FROB without necessity of resorting, is of winning a quotation of market by the captation of a million new particular customers - 700.000 if one deduces those that can go out of the bank-, his great task to fulfill, because until now it bank had spoiled more the PMEs and the societies that the particular customer.
This year it has won 250.000 particular customers and 50.000 societies.
His quotation of market to the individuals is of 3,5%, while to the societies it exceeds the 10%.
Another base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, of which the provocations will be explained by the bank while it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare at present of setting objectives and making them public, because the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the world banking sector.
Sabadell, actually, will finalize this year his Optima master plan, establishes him ya has four years, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the situation of the market has determined his continuation for an exercise furthermore.
The customers who let the crates of savings escape will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola has stressed the fact that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, de facto, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain will "be slow."
Furthermore, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create of the workstations," what is fundamental for the survival of the banked business, has insisted-you him.
And even if he thinks that the war of the debit - which penalizes the margins - him reduced, the price of the bonuses of risk that the banks and crates pay for his emissions to obtain from liquidity are moved itself already to the price of the credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The aspect of the liquidity and of the financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not gripped the faucet, but the differentials are higher," has recognized Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to his network of limiting the credit in the long term and increasing the price of the differentials - to see CincoDías of November 22nd and 27th.
He has confessed also that the tendency of the maintaining banking sector "is of increasing the commissions," but "there is a competitive frame."
The master plan of Sabadell is based on the organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of realizing corporative operations.
It is not "in vain" that he assures that in Spain "one will solicit bigger dimensions."
"Everything will move the next year," has assured-you him.
He maintains that the necessities of capital "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could go to the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the captation of fund in the case of new recapitalizations.
After having assured that Sabadell can survive the worldly fence of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banked foretell already as a new crisis of liquidity.
It notifies that one can not emit, but contrary to what has happened in June, one can obtain from the financing in the short term through rest, what lessens the crisis.
CECA throws back the possibility of a second wave of fusions among the crates
The chief executive officer of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta,a thrown back yesterday the possibility of a nouvelle vague of fusions of crates of savings and has stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
While the trial of concentration of the crates of Spanish savings has begun, there have been several entities that have assured that they were not going to participate in this first stage and that they saved themselves for the second stage.
Nevertheless, the chief executive officer of the Spanish Confederation of Crates of Savings (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, has thrown back yesterday the possibility of the production of this nouvelle vague of operations.
"I think that the greatest part of the fusions has been realized, one can not say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is a second stage, they are adjustments."
"The majority has been realized completely; it is possible that instead of 17 one goes to 13 or 14, but all the great processes have been realized already under the guardianship of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated much in this operation also," has underlined leading it.
In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of the Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is fulfilled "to the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that she is fulfilled in the deadlines that one has set in the past, not maintaining, in the plans of businesses with the Bank of Spain," has emphatisé-you him.
"The passage of 45 crates with an average of 28.500 million of volume of the active ones to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much bigger to be consistent with Basel," has underlined-you him.
Olavarrieta has admitted that "there is a series of little enough happy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serous fluid and of sense," because "it that the Bank of Spain made is to remind that one must respect the deadline before the end of the year."
The chief executive officer of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, has assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of every Europe and "probably" of the world and he has attributed to the people who take it in doubt a "lack of knowledge."
The leader has mentioned that being given the present economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of the financial entities and of the crates of savings, a system that has begun a "very important" process of concentration and "that goes to the possible greater speed."
It has also reminded that the Spanish banking sector is itself well gotten out of the tests of stress that BCE has realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has establishes the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions of the markets have provoked a doble governmental reply.
Of a side, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary of fiscal reductions for the PMEs, regulation of the agencies deprived of investment or suppression of the 426 euros of help to the unemployed persons without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of the 30% of the Raffles of the State.
Of another, the vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of the previous president Felipe González, unites with the criticisms of the chancellor's wife Angela Merkel in what concerns his responsibility of untying the present crisis.
How must these movements be interpreted?
One must mention that the position of Merkel is not one mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, that shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of his partners.
In view of the European resistances, in Germany one starts speculating on the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even so maintaining that seems fiction science, with a current of very favorable opinion, close to a 50% of the population.
The third online one, a new conception of the euro, with the German suggestions for a greater macro-economic control, budget rigor, of the fines at the countries that transgress them, of possible suspensions of payments of one of them and stretching to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and that makes long that it defines itself, consequently now there is not place for excuses.
First, in 2009, while so much IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government has invented one re-forms constitutional to prevent them from 2016.
That has been the first signal of divergence between it which Germany thought that one had to make (plans of fiscal rigor and stability of the public finances) and what his European partners, France ci-inclut, practised.
The second blow of the centre-européen country has been while Merkel in a difficult way has prolonged the decision of saving Greece.
From that moment it has been the subject to a ferocious criticism, but the truth is that the consensus talks about politics in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the aid of Greece.
Finally, around the end of October, Merkel expresses again a clear position, asking re-forms it of the treaties of the Union to look possible the aid of a country and to oblige at the same time to the pretors deprived of supporter a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has thrown the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his suggestion, although a bit sweetened, has been approved and, the months next, we should attend the process of re-forms of the Union that is possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which she does not intend to cross.
And it calls us to everyone that, even so now one must take measures with which one is not can be not too agreed, from this date there the old working of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that transgress the rules will severely be sanctioned, they can be obliged to him declared in suspension of payments and, in that case-there, the private sector will support also one party of the costs.
Germany notifies us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in the consumption, of the improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and of the exterior sales positive.
An alternative based on the debt and the building, with enormous holes in the pair of scales of payments, as the one that has presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And not hearing it would be badly.
It is not only a matter of renewing the public deficit to the 3% in 2013.
What one asks us for is much harder.
And it that it must not make absolutely in these circumstances is of making a mistake ourselves.
I hope that the present turbulences let happen to us a greater calmness.
And that one knows to seize the opportunity that one has given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero has also heard it of this form and his double declaration (re-form them promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the great firms and the announcement of yesterday of the new measures) suggests that, in spite of the criticisms of Merkel, one has opened the path to the thesis that order must be put at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that one envisages, one can not exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too much stuffed with little serious country.
And in that case-there, Germany always will be able to tell to us that it had warned us of it.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will of escaping a sanction.
The expulsion woven as a rule by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23rd against Ajax in the League of the Champions has made to flow much of ink on the anti-sport character of such a behavior and if the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As one knows it, some minutes before finishing the match (that equips them already won clearly), the two players deliberately have lost the time while they have committed mistakes to determine the referee of showing them the second yellow box.
Thus, and considering that Real Madrid will end up being a leader of his group, the two players will fulfill the statutory sanction during the next match of the match of dam against Auxerre and will be able to pass without boxes to the next stage.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA has sanctioned with two matches the trainer of the team, José Mourinho and of different economic sums to the implied players.
The provocation of a yellow box in circumstances as this or similar is not a new, otherwise rather frequent practice in the world of the football.
It is so spilled that it makes left of the ethos, of the non-written, but steady rules, of this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the related case is owed to the made that this has had as protagonist one team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in his hymn displays the nobility and the honor and which in past occasions has sentenced analogs to a fine to his players for acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, he seems, by Mourinho, who adds an episode furthermore to her dilated history of technician histrionique and agitator.
In any case, the request debate if this type of behavior not forbidden expressly by the contradicted regulations the principles of the sport, in other words, if with these actions one commits one fraud of law; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sport regulations, but seem to evade his sense.
The question is of examining the type of damage that they cause to the sport mind.
One of the goods that includes the sport mind is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been puts in danger, in other words there has not been violent game.
Another of these goods that one refers to with the correct game is to avoid the team of the infracteurs players taking advantage of an unfair way of the contrary team, what is not the case either.
However, is it paradoxical of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that she does not adapt to what one characterizes in a normal way as cheating o fraud of the law, because his violation of the rules has not been realized on the sly to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely has tried of being the more evident possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and they have accepted the sanction gladly.
Another question is the type of advantage that the infracteurs obtain of the the examined intentionnées mistakes.
Here it seems necessary to notice that one does not put the rival disadvantage in a situation and one does not obtain an advantage in the same match either, because evidently the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with less players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Evidently the advantage consists in the fact that the players will begin the next stage of the League of the Champions without boxes that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But that is an advantage in the long term, with some degree of indecision, because equips it could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players fulfill a match of sanction and pass to the second cycle of boxes, in which the suspension owed to the accumulation of the boxes happens with one of less than to the first and second year.
So that, to climb the steps, it is not so clear that that is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport mind, of which is nevertheless part the capture of strategic decisions that favor the benefit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not activated to avoid the application of the sanction (that would be indeed an oyster bed case of fraud of the loi),m otherwise they have chosen rather the moment in which they have subjected themselves to it.
They have made a strategic decision without foiling the penalty nor escaping that.
Even if the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion I think that one has had an oyster bed case of genius.
The debate, he seems me, appears because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the manager to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not ethical as much as esthetic.
Offensive of the ones offered to win the dinners of Noël for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for the days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financed by the employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.

To finish complicating the accountancy, the calendar of this year (as the night of the Saint Sylvestre grave Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13th, not having as result until now an avalanche of reservations of dinners as the days peak (on the 17 and on the 17) and nearly anything the previous week.
For 2008, who is the origin of the difficult times, him ya many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budget reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them paying from their own pockets.
Any is the situation, they ask for everyone of the prices of battle, confirms the president of Gremi of Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of that employer, at present, does not dare to foretell how will be the parties this month.
"The people reflects a lot before reserving."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he mentions.
The business will be fine "for those that give quality to good price and with a good service," it adds, and reminds that the customers have the tendency to bring down a step with the crisis, so that settles it around the 25 euros has become predominant in the request.
In a survey in diverse establishments of the center one notices collapse it of requests for the night for the 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have replied adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, Founded It and other), the particularity of the calendar has required more early reservations, even from the beginning of the month of November.
"We have made the impossibleness to maintain the same prices of the year spent, with menus for all the tastes of 19,95 to 30 euros," they detail.
YEAR Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and one total of 23 places, maintains optimistic after having detected a flight of the invoicing for the second semester and of domestics, well that concentrated, perspective of businesses for the Noël.
The sources of the group mention that the 18 will be also an hyper-active day as regards groups of friends who celebrate the parties early.
To their six menus of group they have added one for the noël, with 30 euros or more as famous budget and the perception of that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than the year passed instead of requiring more details, than the wine Catalan produced according to the champenoise - 'cava' method.
They see also the first signs of improvement in some companies invite again their employees and the sensation that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
On behalf of the employers Fecasarm (who includes entities as the Association of Bars, Restoring and Diversion of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of starting seeing the final one of the tunnel and supports that globalement the reservations "are livened up," even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That is true, the hope in what concerns the festivities has not lowered, indifferently of who pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great anxiety in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a rhythm faster than no matter only other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the American embassy of Pakistan and the Department of the State of the United States filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirm the enormous anxieties that causes to Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details that offer on the contents conversations and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the domain of the atomic safety, instead of increasing, "recedes" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult their destruction in the event of attack - one of the main reasons of worries in Washington is.
It is as the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a relation before the visit of the previous adviser of National Safety, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear installations of the territory under attack Taliban, the scattering of the nuclear materials whose noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The great number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and in the programs of missiles is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain keeps it.
"Pakistan has of the to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear installations; being given the fall of the educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who works in the programs nuclear or of missiles" has declared the expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Day Pupils during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new one of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the cooperation every time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the domain of the nuclear proliferation and the one raised Pakistani degree of production of armed nuclear.
A dispatch of the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "disappointing" the communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "The transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain without reply or are "eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, notices that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces weapons nuclear to a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassadress Patterson asks also in Washington, during a visit of the leader of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, that it makes understand "very clearly" to the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
To the hunting of the leader of Wikileaks
Obama will number high person in charge for the anti-terrorist fight at one to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol expresses a red alert to follow the movements and to localize to Assange.
All the aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has expressed a "red alert" to "localize and to follow the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a matter of a traditional order of arrest.
Besides, this is not new, otherwise him date of November 20th.
And this does not have anything to indeed with the last filtration of more than one quarter a million of diplomatic documents of the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian one faces in Sweden.
Besides, the creative lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mister Assange."
On the 20 the international police body having the seat in Lyons (France) has dictated the order to request of Sweden, but it has not made it public up to yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have received the indication of identifying or localizing Assange to obtain his provisional arrest and his extradition.
Even if Interpol can not give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, much of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the red call instructions a free way for the arrest --which the national body of the police must realize -, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where one thinks that Assange is.
The movement has incensed to the lawyers of Assange, that yesterday have published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has appeared willing to reply by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They remind also that Assange has solicited and obtained the license to go out of Sweden of the prosecutor of his case, which one compares with the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, leader of the safety of Stalin.
"That it seems to be a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world does not look for it - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues find itself unknown in a place, but he does not shut up.
On the Monday he has brought together from an indeterminate place one interview to the manager of the review Time through Skype, a conversation in which he has asked for the resignation of the secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that it has been responsible to have to give orders to the American holders of a diploma that they spy on to the UN violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign, has said-him.
His opinion has been insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the House-White, Robert Gibbs, who has described the request as resignation as "absurdity and absurd."
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should interest us," has declared-you him for the CNN.
Obama himself has loaded one high person in charge of the anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Travers, of preventing new escapes of documents.
The testing of the spokesperson of the president Barack Obama of reducing the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions that the politicians and conservative commentators declare these days.
Peter King, the delegate who from January will preside over the Committee of National Safety in the Lower House has asked to the Department of the State that he studies the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and to continue to every person who supplies contributions to them or assistance."
Still further has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, that has of the to come back on his declarations after having said that Assange will have "to be murdered."
"Obama should transform it into objective and wear away a similar airplane without crew or something."
A person who has not asked for excuses has been Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"The one that is in the Government that has filtered the information is guilty of treachery and all what is not an execution would be a too kind punishment," has declared-you him for Fox.
Puigcercós looks for the peace in ERC with winks to the followers of Carod
The republican leader will allow a secret votation to the party on his continuity.
Huguet proposes an executive more plural and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have taken on the recipe to solve the nth internal revolt inside of ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious of the fact that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the previous leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that that can absolutely not give him headaches that it had with other lifeless currents.
It is for that that the leader of Esquerra will try to beat his new criticisms with winks that allow him to armor itself up to the local elections.
To begin, Puigcercós has announced that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to give themselves an opinion on his continuity in secret yesterday.
By ballot papers, not raising the hand.
If the carodistes want to convey some vote of penalty to the president, they will be able it to frighten without none to the retaliations.
Actually, the leader of rows wants to spare his person the picture of division and that of submission.
In several interviews he has maintained that he would not consider itself ratified with the half more one of the votes, but it has added, without mentioning the percentages, which a result "to the Bulgarian one" would not be good either.
The close people to Carod require to the president a bit more what to put his position at the disposal of the activism, a gesture that is not worth while Puigcercós controls the maxim organ between the conferences.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to recognize a travel warrant with the executive until the month of May.
For that, they expect from the national advice to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will subject to the votation on the 18.
His intention is of pressing Puigcercós in return for the promise of this of programming the conference for the autumn of 2011, what the leaders consider as a sure fact.
The leader of ERC has confessed that the "polyphony" affects the stability and that his objective is to make that once and for all the organization is capable of washing his room linen in family.
In this line, the article that the present adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the Innovació holder has thought that is it that the leader will be ratified "in return for diverse objectives" it is as if had made.
And he has enumerated five, of which it underlines two.
The first, "to recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the activism, in other words, to include new faces that come from the follower sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC liquidates of a time for all the assembly as mechanism of working.
Thus, it defends one re-forms statutes that allows the realization of the conferences through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, which has fought already in this sense in the two last conferences.
Actually, convulses it conclave of 2008 has assigned the direction of reviewing the model of assembly in a specific conference of re-forms of the statutes.
This unfinished rest meeting, because the tide interns last years did not recommend to approach this subject.
Maintaining, without sectors criticize on the lookout, the moment could be good to recover it and to close it forever.

Obama promotes the law in Twitter on account of the undocumented students
"If you is agreed with the approval of the Law Dream Act, calls hushed up senators and request-their of approving of this legislation," has American Twitté the president in the popular one social network.
The president Barack Obama is itself gathers today to the national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to legalize the undocumented students, with a message in his credit account of the social network Twitter.
"If you is agreed with the approval of the Law Dream Act, calls hushed up senators and request-their of approving of this legislation," has Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains opened a cybernetic connection to a roomier document that asks to the public to contact immediately the senators, because the vote to the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that one soon hopes for, now it is the moment to listen to your voice," it signals.
The message has been divulged after the 42 republican senators have threatened to block the vote of every legislation if the stretching of the reductions of the taxes of the time of Bush and the financing of the government are prolonged itself.
Such a blocking, announced in a signed letter by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and of other projects as the ratification of the new treaty START with Russia against the proliferation of the nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the republican blocking of the Law Dream Act and of other projects, the presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs has declared that it is a confidant that a time the fiscal problem is solved one will be able to set an agende for the rest of the projects.
"I think that one has a lot of time..."
"We are everyone agreed that this fiscal problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think that we can obtain an agreement at a moment given in this sense and then we will be able to plan the sequence of the rest," has said-him.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, has announced Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "vote of fence of the debate" for the Law Dream Act, reason for which the initiative to legalize the undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most probable would be the next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize 800 a thousand youths that are arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, they have remained in this country the five last years and they have been accepted by an institution of superior education or by the Army.
But the partisans need 60 vote to approve of the initiative, reason why they require the competition of a great number of republicans, in moments where the organizations partisan of the project protagonists an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the Law.
The democrats, the majority of whom presses the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless at least one of them, the senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said that he would vote in against and only a republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for that that the partisans of the Dream Act need the vote of several republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted republicans there are the senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the senator taking out George Lemieux, of Florida, which has completed the mandate known senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who have pressed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they have declared that they were not going to support it in another occasion.
Another republican who has supported it, John McCain, has not defined his posture until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts are agreed with the fact that the greater obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures one puts the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language has been a walk in which the participants have made display of the narration
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what one expects from me"?, has asked for the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited has to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and who this time has used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table has been dedicated to the Sex in the language, has explained-you it).
The finger on the plaie..."nous puts in the trouble," has thrown sweetly the writer silvery to the public, most of the youths, that had met to the International Fair of the Book of Guadalajara (THREAD) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero have participated.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as protagonist who looks for knowledge what is the "wound," it goes of a doctor to another, without obtaining a reply, only of the tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectiologue it goes out convinced: "the patience is not my loudly, it is maybe my wound."
In the end, after one disappointed approach with the traumatologue that has cut it the breath in the middle of the corridor, but that explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalist that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, the symbolism is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: "on the wound I have only can knowledge that it is that is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very related among them.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with the two of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful narration that he has titled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given moment is discovered.
With keys of magic realism, he talks about a first-rate enchanter who touched clouds, made to return people that he be gone far or made up for virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narration that transfers to speak afterwards America, the great news that has had his own columnists from the beginning and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the excesses of the narrations of the conquering braggarts.
"Cervantes that has invented us everyone (the writers) has laughed at the fake witnesses who appeared as real in the presented histories, but of an aitre way never one would have related the history of America with an imagination that missed even of the decency."
Nevertheless, has underlined-you him, "the madmen and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, one does not know anymore what part of the narration belongs to a gang or another, where the literature of fiction reaches his apogee.
One calls that de facto the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his inheritance that one is what one relates."
Successively, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and has applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the THREAD with his round table owes It on the wound.
The Cuban-portoricaine has puts hers on the great wound of the social violence that his strut country - and Latin America shares - produces arguments of the trades and of the sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course" is not "premeditated," has indicated-you it, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that settles between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who has also underlined "it owes on the wound of the engaged writer."
He has considered that in a world that lives in great speed also in what concern the intellectual habits and the control of the consciences that turns to the advantage of the dogmatisms, "behind every assertion there is a small not and behind every negation there is a small yes."
To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we must shade: and to shade means much of time to put the finger on the wound and to disturb the people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without shade and to disturb also to the powers that prefer a world in white and black," has said-him, inducing to recover the sense of writing.
Romano to the hunting of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finales it has had tops and bottoms in his career, but he has known to reach three times the decisive series.
With the dual of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finale, there are two different styles that are confronted besides, marked by their technicians, who find among them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finales, it has had tops and bottoms in his career, but he has known to reach three times the decisive series, even so until now it has not put in the a thousand and it is for that that this occasion is very special for it.
The Argentinian has ended up consoling itself with the medal of under-champion, it has remained a step behind the winners and strangely with the same one team it has played of the consecutive finales.
The strategist santiste has arrived to his first finale in so much that entraineur in the Tournament of Opening 2002, while it kept the reins of Morelia with which it has lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; ulteriorly, in the Fence 2003 also it has arrived to the decisive dual and has lost again with the global result of 3-1 and that has been precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered again a back, because his team has made a match equal of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties it has obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three from his players have failed of 11 meters and he has suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finales with the Diablos Rojos and a with Monterrey, his rival to the tournament, consequently it does not want to have the same one fate, he tries to free oneself from the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he maintains that for it the institution is more important.
"I want to be first-rate, I do not want to break off any statistic, that is for a club, not for a passion that I have and consequently I will obtain the title, but what I have mentioned before is more important," has commented on the helmsman while one has asked him what his weak points would be in the finales.
He remembers much the last finale, of which he assures that much it has learned, "the unique lesson that we can keep it is that until the referee whistles the final one, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because last time, with two penalties to pull we were already prepared to run and I believe that that is a lesson, before the end of the match one can not celebrate."
It knows that this series could define itself by penalties, what does not worry it, because it entrusts in his players: "One does not try ever to arrive to the series of penalties, one tries to finish in the regular deadline, but sometimes it is left to us only to get ready, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made a bad turn to us, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding titrates it between our hands, hands it has gotten away us, that has served to us as lesson for this finale and we hope that one does not arrive to that situation anymore."
Romano has now the occasion of not being an under-first-rate technician anymore and enjoying for the first time the glory offered by the titles.

The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, to 13:00 hours to the seat of the NASA in Washington for experts in astrobiologie, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of the life in the Universe.
While she has quoted the press, NASA has assured that it would present who will have impact on the research of the extraterrestrial life," what has aroused speculations on behalf of the experts of other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory according to which there are similar creatures ours and in surrounding hostile that one thought uninhabited and he would put the possibility of becoming beings on the table intelligent as the human beings if his conditions of life are improved.
It seems that one talks about a microbe discovered basically of the Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, which lives in a surrounding that one thought too much venomous for any way of life, because the lake is rich in arsénique.
Of all forms, the creature uses the arsénique one as a way of living and this capacity makes us to think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologistes, if these organisms use the arsénique one in their metabolism, that proves that "that we know" that there is another different way of life, a second way of life.
The spatial agency will communicate the true range of the discoveries in the press conference of tomorrow, Thursday.
To the conference will participate the géobiologie Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the greatest satellite of Saturne), under the perspective of that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia has mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and it is for that that they form a plural group.
One can not allow, has pursued him, that the Conference, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistique."

The hotelkeeper José Ramón Manguart Sánchez has said that the fall of the tourist has exposes the lack of prevention and maintenance on behalf of the Town Hall.
"The municipality ow to accept his responsibility and to avoid that going by again, how to make it, therefore has shortcoming of a preventive maintenance and not to make only the hotfix," has said-him.

Fourteen people have been stopped and will make in view of diverse accusations.
The searches have taken place at Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, predominantly in places that would have been used to the production of drug.

The firm people had to appear at the palace of justice of Sherbrooke in the hours in accordance with their arrest.
They could make in view of accusations of production of cannabis, of possession with the aim of making some the traffic, of plot and of flight of services, among others.
These searches have taken place subsequent to an inquiry of long breath, which has lasted close at hand of a year.
"It is information received of the public that has allowed us to conduct these arrests," has clarified Mr. Ruel.
About 70 policemen of the regional module of inquiry of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, of the Police Department of Sherbrooke and of the State Control of police Memphrémagog, have taken part in this police operation.
The secret migration will be able to continue without problem
The bill of the conservatives that, according to the government, should settle the problem of the boats loaded with secret migrants, goes of every obviousness to be beaten even though the three parties of opposition have made to know Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I lean strongly on the Charter."
"I behave standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," has declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, even though it was surrounded with deputies after the dress of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals claim that the such bill that proposed, who would allow detaining until a year every person coming from a ship identified as transporting secret immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of the rights and freedoms.
The leader of the Quebecois Block, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that it could not support the bill, because he blames the bad target.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties of the opposition are against, then one will see what the government" will "make," has declared Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD as regards immigration, Olivia Chow, has thrown back of the back of the hand the criticisms wanting his party not to be firm enough regarding the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats are agreed so that one takes measures against the ferrymen of secret and it is what we make by the intervention of another bill, the C-35," has indicated Mme Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the conservatives because he blames the refugees and imprisons the children for at least one year," has explained Mme Chow.
The minister of the Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of opposition of playing at the policy and of ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians tell massively to the deputies that they do not tolerate this kind of secret migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and that treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect what Canada takes firm measures," has reacted the minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, what would have been able to take the country to elections occurring his rejection.
A conservative has however said at the Agency QMI that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every deputy who will oppose explains himself afterwards in front of his voters.
The new unity does not make the unanimity
In spite of the announcement of the possible creation of a unity perm to fight against the corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue ask for the creation of a commission of public inquiry on the subject.
The minister of the public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea does not date of yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York to it subject from January last.
The metropolis possesses a permanent unity on the corruption for 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Tuesday has discovered more than one.
It must be said about Robert Dutil that during a meeting of the permanent Advice on the police services of Quebec, on last October 29th, this measure has never been discussed in spite of the presence.
More were not needed so that the péquiste criticism as regards public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, describes this announcement of "rabbit taken out as a hat" and of "solution fixed on the corner of a table."
The minister Dutil has as for it replied to those that fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You are going to see the result when one is going to announce it, he contents with asserting."
"One is conscious of that problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting-up of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more the people think of hiding than you and me that it has something," it explains.
"The only means of having a commission of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains as for it Yves Boisvert, teacher of ethics and of gouvernance to the national School of public administration.
To go out from this deadlock, he suggests therefore in Quebec to give the general controller a special mandate so that he holds an inquiry on the collusion and the corruption.
"One must be capable of broadening the mandate of the general controller," it cuts.
He considers also that Quebec could give the same powers to the controller as to a commissioner, allowing him thus to oblige people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the boxes of the government Charest.
Quebec would ask also in Ottawa to modify the criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would emanate of the prosecutor of the Hammer operation, which has informed the Attorney General Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of inquiries.
The federal minister of the public Safety, Vic Toews, has as for it confirmed that his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, studies présentement on some amendments related to this file.
During the operation Spring 2001, which struck the groups of motorcyclists, even if the criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people have been stopped.
Ottawa has thereafter made to adopt the Law on the gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The animator of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has undergone a partial back owing the Canadian Advice of the norms of the radiotélévision (CCNR) for intentions debated on the social aid and the Haitians as on his coarse language in waves.
The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some intentions contained "inaccurate information on the social aid, of the unduly negative representations of the Haitians and of the coarse language that do not invite to the emissions diffused for the day."
The Advice also has concluded that a discussion on the suicide, including the diffusion of the name of two people who had committed suicide, have not infringed the codes on the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during emissions diffused between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision has been given back subsequent to a complaint of the common Forehead of the social helped people of Quebec.
The group complained about the amounts quoted in the emission being inaccurate.
The animators must present solid information rather than liars must.
Regarding the suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered that the suicide is a gesture of coward.
The majority of the members of the Committee have concluded that the conveyed message was that the suicide must not be seen as a solution to the problems of the life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the questioned episodes of "Dupont the midday" have approached a delicate subject in an equitable and appropriate way."
No blame has therefore been held on to his place.
The last dispute dealt with declarations that have followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given themselves to a media encounter that had aroused many reactions.
The animator of CHOI has declared that it had not made any gift to help the Haitians because one could not know with certainty that the needy people would receive really the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not excessive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already ridded my suspension of three days on top."
"My file is a Virgin for a year and a half," has declared the animator.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the diffusion of coarse language.
In every case, the radiodiffuseur CHOI-FM has collaborated "beyond his obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station that will owe, among others, to announce these decisions a time for the hours of great listening in a deadline of three days.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
The Montréalais of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely particular route.
The athlete who excels at "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and in boxing Thai mounting on the tatamis and the rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I had started practising the martial arts as the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, has explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis for 2008 to evolve by the professionals."
"In my case, I look for fightings a bit everywhere, since for those that do not like the game at the ground present in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Lately, the one that works as agent of safety and as clerk for the company UPS has precisely freed from bad news to his rivals, taking away two gold medals to the Championship of the amateur world of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), of 23 on October 30th, in Edinburgh, in Scotland.
"I have taken away the categories of kickboxing full contact and of Thai boxing, it has explained."
"Presently, I get ready for going in China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The combatants that have finished among the four first during the last championship of the world in every category were invited."
"I have taken away the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, to the Vietnam, I have finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I have concluded the tournament to the fifth row, even though I have arrived third in Toronto in 2009, it has added."
"What is interesting, it is that I have progressed to every competition."
"To this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China where the punches and of foot, as the projections to the ground, are authorized.
The duals take place originally on a platform and more seldom in a ring.
The most famous pugilist stemming from this form of fighting is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of the martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal does not have to keep only one event in his career, it will reply definitely his presence to the super tournament "King of Sanda," the super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most turned-up and the most prestigious in China, has explained the nice chap."
"It is the equivalent of the Stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand) a bit."
"It has been a super experience."
Zemmal has taken away his first fighting, in semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in finale.
"The one that has defeated me was a true pro, it has analyzed."
There are four combatants by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals clash in finale of their category."
"Afterwards, the winners of every category make face to themselves in order to crown only one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls of offers
Hydro-Québec has matched de gré à gré 450 million dollars in contracts to firms of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
To the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a formed consortium of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the most important, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without call of offers.
This consortium called Energy management has been constituted in 2004 of concomitant way to the choice of Hydro-Quebec of entrusting to the private sector his responsibility of managing this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy consortium management gave up the lucrative one contract without it having been there of public call of offers.
For the Quebecois Party, the resort to consortiums of firms puts a serious ethical problem that risks to eliminate the competition and to cause a rise of the prices.
"It is the new way of making collusion and of destroying the competition."
"That is to say the people, instead of making that in a secret way, now make it in opened way," has declared yesterday the péquiste deputy Sylvain Simard in press conference.
More early in morning, Mr. Simard has raised the question to the French National Assembly because it says to see in a difficult way how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
The minister of the natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, has replied in afternoon, denying sturdily that collusion has been for this contract.
"I start having my journey," she has cursed, maintaining that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigor."
She has said that "it would be" the lesser one of the things "that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of the consortiums is an ordinary practice in the whole world.
It is usually a matter of an alliance limited in the time that allows two or several firms of gathering their respective expert evaluations in order to reply to a call of offers for a complex project.
The project Eastmain comprises a high level of complexity considering the extent of the works.
The building site is in process and must spread up to in 2012.
Though, the contract has been attributed without the game of the competition acting; there has been negotiation.
So, the formula of the consortiums is not an exception anymore in the Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the last week The Duty revealed it, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the genius-advice is the subject to an inquiry to the government.
A fast browsing of the register of the firms of Quebec allows counting more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of his main competitors, of which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are tens, brings back to an only and same moral person, or Dessau.
With regard to the Energy consortium management, the minister Normandeau has underlined that "the territory of the Bay James replies to particular dynamics of labor and that Hydro-Quebec replies in a particular way for the years 70."
The grand patron of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Society of energy of the Bay James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has made to frown on the fact that the contract of management of the project has been granted de gré à gré.
"If you go in call of offers and that there are few tenderers, your prices are going to be put up more."
"You have two choices: is that you catch the people who are in that market and that you say: one is going to negotiate a harmony satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the idea, it is that it is not the price that is important, it is the ability of the people," has asserted Mr. Laporte.
This contract matched to the Energy consortium management made part of a long list of contracts of more than 50 000 $ obtained by the Quebecois Party.
The contracts have been granted by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, The Duty has counted 109 contracts of genius-advice granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or to their subsidiaries, notably of the laboratories of grounds.
SNC-Lavalin has swiped 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation to Energy management.
All the contracts have been negotiated.
They totalize 449 783 344 $, including the contract to Energy management of 295 131 564 $.
Sylvan Simard has let understand that the four firms that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) "are well known to the liberal Party of Quebec."
The minister Normandeau has let fall that the PQ is also related to these firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was a matter rather of his leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire trust
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecois consumer trusts very little to the actors of the lasting development, but also to the equitable brands and to the écologisantes certifications to guide his choices.
Worse, even if it baths in a media universe where the messages in favor of a more responsible consumption pullulate, he laments a lack of credible information, deficiency that it describes even as brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading has been delivered yesterday.
Even if they have made to increase the consumption of products called socially responsible in 2010, the Quebeckers seem though to agree very little of credit to those that try to sell to them.
Two thirds of them say indeed not to believe the environmental commitment of the firms everything as the green advertisement of the companies, reveals the tool of measure elaborated by the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University Sherbrooke.
Other report: half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the products called equitable, but also the credibility of the products and of the brands being displayed as being écoresponsables, indicates the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this theme is taken seriously only by 14,6% of the Quebeckers.
The information as regards responsible consumption seems though primordial to stimulate this section of the consumption livened up presently by close to the third of the Quebecois consumers.
Indeed, the space and the dubious character of the information would soothe the ardors of 46% of the consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the price more put up from these products.
Besides, a third of the Quebeckers tell the products or green services to itself as distrustful to the alleged performances as one tries to put to them between the hands.
On another bill, the consumers have been close to the half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially to have changed of brand of a or several products to reply to their conviction.
To height of 61%, also they have favored purchases next to storekeepers of their area and elite the purchase of foodstuffs cultivated in their region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - the clue of the responsible consumption has affected 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year -, the consumus Homosexual of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of the recycling that tries to reduce his environmental imprint worrying of the protection of the animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems though to remain outside his car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, hardly 28% of the Quebeckers have indicated to have used the transport in common or have advocated the covoiturage to defend their green interests.
The walk and the bike have also been supported by 39,1% of the participants to this vast behavioral inquiry, which has taken his first snapshot just.
A loan of the State for the purchase d'eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who one has asked to start financially in the purchase of the complex of cinema eXcentris by the Society Angus and the Parallel, accepts to collaborate, but to competition of a loan only.
The Society of development Angus and the Parallel, that expected a gift of seven million dollars from the ministry of the Culture to purchase Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent returning him his full cinéphilique vocation, do not obtain what they asked for.
The government accepts to be implied in the file, but to his own conditions.
Rather than the gift waited for, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be moreover inferior to the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution to worthwhile conditions, at least of the opinion of the sources stemming from the dispensaries of the State.
A first plan of action and a request for 12,8 million had already been thrown back by Quebec last spring, but the petitions have reviews to the fall for summer.
A suggestion and a plan of action have been sent to the minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society of development of the cultural firms (SODEC), François Macerola, that pilots the file d'eXcentris.
It has been it to manage an ultimate relation ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the office has gotten to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to reply to it.
It seems though that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be discarded.
Let's remind that the Association of the owners of cinemas and of cinéparcs of Quebec opposed a direct investment of the State to press the purchase d'eXcentris, accusing that the ministry of the Culture does not have to finance property projects, what it has not made for other movie theaters.
But on the contrary several participants of the environment asked for a substantial economic help.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has for ten years carried to end of arm the cinema of author in his places of the complex after having financed itself his building, what could justify a dispensation on behalf of the Advice of the treasure.
The lack of rooms for the independent films is blatant in Montreal, and eXcentris had known to secure the loyalty of his customers.
The Society Angus and the Parallel, with to their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, of their side, a campaign of financing to the private sector, hoping to gather 700 000 $ to lead acquisition into the wheel.
For the spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future purchasers is of reopening the three rooms on next February 27th planning the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des men and of the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not reminded The Duty and one ignores what it and his group think suggestions to the fall that are made to them.
The veil raised on a Canada given a complex...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States consider as the complex of inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but they betray as a result the feeling of superiority of these last wrong sides Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats are surprised by every Canadian voter not having the canado-américaines relationships to the mind going to vote and believe that the visit of the president Obama has helped the conservative government to make his budget adopt in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy to Ottawa and Washington, spread on the public yesterday, offer more crusty details that of the substantial contents to put itself under the tooth.
A cable dated of September 22nd, 2008, is in full federal election campaign, relates to what point the United States are not part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador in post in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
M. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian complex of inferiority conditions maybe the Canadian political leaders to speak of interior stakes of the daily rather only of making to carry this election on the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ," written-him.
The United States are therefore, it concludes, "the proverbial one elephant of this election: omnipresent, but too much potentially threatening to speak some."
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, it values, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and still more than one leader of left to manage this essential relationship should be a factor-key that the voters have to the mind going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22nd, 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for businesses in Ottawa, preparing the president Barack Obama to his first visit in Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to assure the survival of the government during the beginning vote of confidence February on the federal budget, by which Canada will display his first deficit on top of a decade because of a plan of revival of 30 to 40 billions dollars," to written language Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it not made mention that the government has had to prorogue the Parliament before Noël to avoid being knocked over by the coalition and that the parties of opposition made his survival conditional to the quality of the plan of revival proposed.
Another communication, dated back to January 2008 and signed of the ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington about the more and more negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast to CBC send back of the United States.
The ambassador worries about the emissions To Edge, Little Mosque one the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one observes little subtle references to Maher Arar, in the "No-Fly-List" or still to the kidnappings for muscular cross-examinations of the CIA.
Another cable relates that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to receive some prisoners of Guantánamo.
M. Kouchner has replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "it has replaced a paper in the Secretary of State by the way of Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has accepted to revise the file."
Finally notice that the minds warm up regarding the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a previous adviser very close to Stephen Harper, has declared on the waves of CBC that the person in charge of this massive escape should "be murdered."
It has become the echo of Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A world plan to renovate the lighting
The UN has proposed yesterday to Cancún a plan of renovation of the domestic, commercial lighting and manufacturer in 100 countries with a view to obtaining a reduction from greenhouse gas (GES) that corresponds nearly to the third of the reduction additional that one must realize to stabilize the planetary climate of here 2020.
This ambitious plan is located in the stride of the great concrete projects which the UN hopes to make adopt to Cancún to compensate for the absence of constraining commitments of reduction by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put down yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize still of 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompactes bulbs or, better, by bulbs to electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the main part of the 1,8 billion tons (Gt) of GES issued on the planet to enlighten the human beings would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary self-propelled park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the great emitting countries, as the United States, China, Europe and others, of which Canada, have started in voluntary plans of reduction that should make to pass the global emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But Gt will have to be taken away from this assessment still 5 to manage to stabilize 2020 of here the rise of the climate at 2 centigrade degrees in order to avoid his becoming out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produced of the light.
With fluocompactes bulbs, the expense of energy is reduced of 75% and with the new bulbs to DEL, one reduces this need of energy of two times still.
The fluocompactes bulbs last on average of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new bulbs to DEL, as those that the manufacturer Philips threw this week - moreover this society has participated in the study of the UN -, have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy that one incandescent bulb, what gives an idea of the possible economics with a plan of substitution that would apply to 100 countries.
These very new bulbs can also work with rheostats in plus of emitting very little of heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have displayed reserves at the place of the fluocompactes bulbs since they contain mercury and that they must be eliminated as dangerous waste, what is not always possible in the developping countries, unless the manufacturers set up orders.
But, indicates the relation, the main source of emission of mercury on the planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the hydroelectric power stations to the coal, which emit a lot of mercury to cause electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States only, those central emit 25 000 tons of mercury by year.
The relation details the earnings that every country thanks to this program would make international.
For example, the Indonesia would save thus a billion dollars per annum in purchases of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, is the equivalent of 3,5 hydroelectric power stations whose building would cost him 2,5 billion.
The Ivory Coast waits in the nervousness for the announcement of the electoral results
The secretary general of the UN, Round of Applause Ki-moon, has asked for the publication "without deadline" of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiration of the set deadlines.
"The secretary general underlines the necessity for the independent electoral commission of finishing his work and of announcing the provisional results without more deadline, has underlined a spokesperson of the leader of the ONU."
"It asks to all the Ivorian parts and to the institutions of showing and of refraining from every initiative up to the announcement of the provisional results."
In spite of the pressures trained by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let spend the buffer date of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the ballot of Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiration of the deadline, the president of the CEI had maintained on television that the commission "continued work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world so that finally the CEI declares the name of the winner of the second turn between going out it Laurent Gbagbo and refusing it Alassane Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo counts on the annulation by the constitutional Advice of "fraudulent" votes in the north, kept by the ex-rebellion of the new Strengths (NF) from the coup missed of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, manager of campaign of the Ivorian president, has maintained that manoeuvre them of intimidation of the voters practised by the NF in the north of the country had dissuaded the ones partisan of the outgoing president of going to vote.
The whole election could be canceled if the complaints put down by Gbagbo are kept by the constitutional Advice.
Yet the adversaries of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North that denies every connection to the ex-rebels, has considered "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked to Gbagbo of respecting them, but it has not gone up to claiming the victory.
His allies maintain that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that it has lost and that lodging a complaint in the face of the constitutional Advice, after having prevented the electoral commission from broadcasting the results, would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidential one, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country remained split into two for years.
The United Nations have warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class of her being able to be kept responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in mind voices from the first turn, on October 31st, with 38% against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who has received the public support of the previous president Henri Konan Bédié (25% at the first turn).
The unemployment rate has remained stable in France at the 3rd term
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the international Office of the Work (BIT) has remained stable to 9,3% in metropolis (9,7% counting the departments of overseas), show the corrected data of the provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed persons settles at 2,631 million in metropolis.
The data of the second term have been confirmed to 9,3% of the working population in metropolis and 9,7% with the DOM.
Towards a year, the unemployment rate is displayed on the rise of 0,1 not.
No more largely, 3,4 million people in metropolitan France did not work on the third term but wished to work, that they are or not available in the two weeks to work and for which they search or not a job.
The situation of the present youths on the labor market still has deteriorated, with a new rise of the unemployment rate, carried to 24,2% in metropolis (+ 0,9 not towards three months, +0,5 not towards a year) and 25% including the DOM.

The seniors have known for their part a slight rise of the unemployment, to 6,4% in metropolis (+0,2 not towards three months as towards a year), or 482 000 people of 50 years or more, and 6,6% with the DOM.
Alone the 25-49 years have benefited of a stability of the unemployment at the third term, to 8,3% in metropolis (-0,1 not towards three months, +0,1 not towards a year) and 8,8% in the whole France.
The Insee does not publish monthly unemployment rate anymore for 2006, after a debate on his method of calculation.
Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, keeps on on the other hand making it and has announced Tuesday a rate of 9,8% for the France (Included DOM) in October after 9,9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini put in examination and put in possession
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years, leading of firms of treatment of waste and brother of the PS president of the department council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, has been put in examination and imprisoned to the prison of Luynes, close to Aix-in-Provence within the framework of an inquiry on public markets presumed fraudulent.
Alexandre Guérini has been put in examination for abuse of social goods, embezzlement and of public properties, concealment, active corruption, traffic of influence and possession of ammunitions, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining himself on all the questions that the magistrate is going to ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is an other thing to prove them," had declared to the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his customer.
M. Guérini, brother of the man strong of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has insisted, by the intermediary of his lawyers, on making to pass a mémo to the judge before his hearing in order to explain oneself.
One of his close relations, Philippe Rapezzi, also has been put in examination Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his customer never has made anything else only of making to work the discharges that it had to manage.
As for the attribution of the markets or to the destination of the funds related to their working, it knowledge has never had some, it Me Simon has said.
In this business, Daniel Pinna, general ex-manager of the services of the conglomeration of Aubagne, has been put in examination Wednesday for embezzlement public and complicity, and left free under control judicial with ban to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My customer has known to supply explanations to the facts that it is reproached for."
"The instructor magistrate has taken into account not depriving it of freedom," has said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been put in examination and deliveries at liberty in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with investment under control judicial for two of them, has indicated the assistant prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, chief executive officer attached to the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropolis (MPM), "traffic of influence and passive corruption" is prosecuted.
Two officials of the conglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, is put in examination the one for "subtraction and diversion of public properties per a person responsible for a mission of public service," the other one for "complicity of embezzlement public."
Finally the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been put in examination for "concealment of abuse of social goods."
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini depicts Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, imprisoned lately in a parallel business of fraudulent public markets concerning in Corsica.
The investigators suspect his societies of having been used to whiten money of the organized crime.
The inquiry is led within the framework of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 subsequent to anonymous mails, for frauds presumed in the signing of public markets, in particular in the path of the waste.
Of source close to the inquiry, the investigations concentrate notably on the conditions of attribution and working of a discharge of La Ciotat, who gathers the waste of Aubagne as of some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Business Clotilde Reiss: the French presidency has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, takes out it of Clotilde Reiss, the French inquiring teenager order in Iran for "espionage," has held the opinion in breath in France, put the diplomacy in alert, and stressed the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Tehran.
The whole under the attentive glance of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted through The World reveal some underwears of this crisis.
They describe how the French presidency has explained his strategy to the Americans, going up to giving them advice for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French persons in charge have tried to convince Washington of the release of the young French not having had the delivery as equivalent at liberty of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and searched by the American justice for traffic of materials to the profit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a light thought the way of which the French presidency has tried to handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was not anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12th, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases of hostages."
The adviser of the French presidency for the strategic businesses, François Richier, accompanied of the manager of the Quay of Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend to the Americans to make some as much to repatriate their specificity going out again kept de force in Iran.
"Made of the noise," they say, "hammer constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It is needed in order to clutter the system Iranian, sensitive to his picture.
"Make it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to make it."
Because, passed the attempts of discussions by discreet canals, "the silence not règlera nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers."
M. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "some familiar Iranian tactics: the taking of hostages for the blackmail talks about politics."
It announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (that will intervene on August 16th, day where she shelters to the embassy of France) will "need the payment to the Iranians of a broad sum of money" (230 000 euros of deposit).
And it makes know that the French presidency anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that is going to deteriorate.
The Iranians would be able "in a close future to stop another of the few 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," it says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has gone out from prison since twelve days, but it remains blocked in Iran.
An information is broadcast: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States ask for the extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is replaced at liberty in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as numerous observers, questions itself about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks down the Iranian secret networks of acquisition of material destined for the nuclear program, the broadening of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a bargaining?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new maintenance with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier assures that it is not the case.
The French presidency, it says, has not only completely "taken by surprise by the decision of the judge," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not come back on the" judicial "decision," he observes.
M. Richier wants to demonstrate also that Majid Kakavand is placed under the "narrow" surveillance of the French information services.
The adviser of the French presidency composes a telephone number, hangs up, then shapeless the American diplomat that the Iranian "presently "is localized in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the possession of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the French presidency does not handle his efforts carefully, by means of communiqués and of "escapes" organized in the media, to make to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and notice that the handling carries his fruits since several articles of press echoe the French official version.
A telegram dated of August 25th, 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French officials."
On what is founded so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of their declarations full of praises, the French officials admit in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really made."
The document bends afterwards on the reasons that have driven the French presidency to lapse into this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims at validating the policy of Sarkozy of opening in Syria," it analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, who had "then" been "perceived, by numerous voices criticize in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries to "demonstrate in Syria what praises it can attract itself playing a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also of "sowing seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it of good source.
On August 11th, François Richier has entrusted to him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians have made whatsoever."
"But nevertheless we have thanked them."
"That should at least sow the confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss brings in in France on May 16th, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the French presidency.
In a communiqué, it thanks the presidents for the Brazil, of Senegal, and of Syria, for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
Not of online games for the young Koreans passed midnight
The sud-coréen government is going to adopt a law said "of Cinderella" that will forbid the adolescents to play at online games after midnight blocking their access, have indicated governmental persons in charge.
A bill is going to be subjected to the Parliament in December to ask to the societies of online games of blocking the access to these games after midnight, to the youths aged of less than 16 years, have indicated representatives of the ministries of the culture and of the family.
"Many" children play at these games all night and have afterwards difficulties to study at the school and to have a normal life for the day."
"We consider that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," has declared to the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial person in charge in load of the bill.
The online games will be again accessible to 6 hours of the morning.
The societies will have a year to get ready for the application of the law, it has clarified.
The government plans also to ask to the societies to limit the time of daily access to these games for the youths whose parents make some the request, has added the person in charge.
He is also going to put free software that allows limiting the time spent on Internet at the disposal of the people that people ask for it.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the newspapers report regularly diverse facts related to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is also the uncontested champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had taken away four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, opposite 58 other nations.
Mondial 2018-2022: the Fifa refers to the organizing countries
In full storm because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa refers to Thursday the organizing countries of the Cups of the world 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the fights of influence and the lobbying risk to take the step on the technical criteria.
A thing is sure, the edition 2018 of the queen competition of the Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the international Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after one first on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue his establishment at the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities being part of the delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of gevernment Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic stakes and policies of one Mondial.
The negotiations in backstage risk therefore to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult of establishing a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the relation of evaluation of the Fifa, the English files, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) possess of better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee on time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, originally revelations having led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), thus could have ruined the chances of his country, cradle of the football that has received that World only one time, in 1966.
The BBC has replaced a coat, Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Of that to displease the Fifa and to embarrass the English persons in charge, which have launched into an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in first line.
The leader of the government hopes to republish the blow succeeded at by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organization in 2005 for London from the JO-2012.
This intense activity will suffice to regild the coat of arms of England next to the CE?
Nothing is less sure because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with his already ready stadiums, his expert evaluation (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and his foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could give a shower their ambitions.
The possible retaliations against the English and the doubts on the solvency of the Spain and of Portugal make only to increase the quotation of the Russia, become an outsider of weight in spite of the gaps of his file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine has decided not to carry out the moving to Zurich and has denounced a "disloyal competition in the preparation of the vote," in a hardly veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE.
"One covers them with mud, one tries to compromise them," has thrown Mr. Poutine.
For 2022, the United States, strong of the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a length in advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidacies appear premature for two countries having co-organized the test in 2002.
Other threat: the concession of the Mondial-2026 in China, burningly wished for by the Fifa, that would give back in fact deciduous the Asian chances for 2022.
With the Qatar, which has taken out the great game proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would pursue his expansion to countered news, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, also could suffer from the weakness of the rights TV acquitted (because of the time difference) by the European countries, the nerve of the war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: the obviousness
Of Gaulle really had hesitated.
Mitterrand had made to believe that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the lesser hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less that them.
A mandate in the French presidency calls another.
Therefore the present leader of the State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not compatible with the part of mystery attached to the presidential duty.
Then one must make as if the doubt always existed.
In a sense as in the other one.
In 2006, even without believing in it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15th, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere at the autumn of the year 2011."
That it evokes members of parliament UMP in front, Tuesday night in the French presidency, the perspective of "two mandates" therefore has sown a little feverishness.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
One was far.
The president made only to remind two that the constitutional review of 2008 limited the number of five year terms.
It made a report, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that it evokes the presidential one, on the tone of the humor, lors such meetings.
"At the worst, or at best, you have some still as seven years and half with me," it had thrown to them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not believe that I do not think about the stage of after."
His intentions of avant-hier do not give back it more candidate that looks after it; they do not give it back less.
If they arouse comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But that is not the entry in lists of Ségolène Royal that drive Nicolas Sarkozy to unveil itself.
It is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that a lot to the PS ask for a tidying of battle more precocious than predict.
The bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time the voters of right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-The Express).
"We have a candidate and there is not discussion to the UMP on top," immediately and carefully has reacted the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," entrusts Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will believe always to be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obviousness.
Euro: the BCE forced to maintain his purchases of titles of State
The last meeting of the Advice of the governors of the European Central Bank (BCE) of the year had to be the occasion of clarifying the terms of exit of crisis or, at least, of announcing the stopping of a good number of the not conventional operations of monetary policy that owe s'achèver at the end of the year.
Crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the institute of emission of Frankfurt will no doubt not be able to allow itself to also be peremptory on pain of aggravating a situation more than tightened today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be raised all the more.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has thus greeted the active role played by the BCE in favor of the resolution of the crisis of the debts of the States in Europe.
She has not wished to say if she considered that the central bank had to make more, increasing for example his program of purchase of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my thought to my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the commission of the economic and monetary Businesses of the European Parliament, the president of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not appeared more talkative as for his intentions, contenting with indicating what the program of purchase of titles of State on the secondary market continued and what "we will see what we will decide" during the meeting of this Thursday.
Only certainty: the BCE is going to keep his main unchanged guiding rate to 1%, his lowest historical level since May 2009.
In the facts, the purchases of treasury notes by the BCE have doubled the last week, at nearly 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of operators of market, she would have carried out new Irish and Portuguese purchases of titles, yesterday.
Altogether, the central banks of the eurosystème have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the operators of market, the anticipations of a pursuit of the purchases do not make any doubt (to see page 29).
The economists neither do not wait of notable change in cape.
If the operations of loans at more than three months have already disappeared of the arsenal of the BCE, the latter conducts still unlimited allocations of liquidities according to conditions generous and for spreading durations of a week at three months.
The economists expect today what this mechanism is prolonged of some months.
"I can not imagine that it modifies his program in an important way."
"Otherwise it would be to take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," values Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit announced in the course of the first term 2011 seems more probable," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist by Sal, from his side.
Oppenheim.
On the plan of his interventions on the market of the public debt, "the BCE should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to liven up a lifeless market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the importance of the exposures of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the euro zone, the institute of emission does not have other choices only of maintaining his presence on the market.
"It needs to substitute itself for the lack of investors on the market and to act of such a sort to prevent a flight of enthusiasm of the yields paid by the most fragile States at all costs," it testified an important debenture administrator yesterday.
Because if the interest rates fly away, the States will be bothered all the more to reduce their indebtedness, otherwise to stabilize it.
The maintenance of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government Berlusconi makes the round back
After a beginning of week worrying for Italy, the situation has slackened, yesterday a bit, with the ebb of the debenture rates at 10 years.
A return to the precarious quietness.
To the to go out of a meeting with the minister of the Economics, the presidents of region have said to have heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, what the concerned one has denied afterwards.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 points of base and the price of the contracts of blanket against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown away to 263 points, taking some panic to Rome.
In Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has made to notice that in Spain, the gap with the German rates was superior to 400 points of base.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, has declared itself "strongly worried" by "the turbulences of the markets" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third economics of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson Institute.
In light, his problem is the absence of growth and the atony of the fiscal incomes that goes with, making to run the risk to the State of not being able to cover his needs with financing anymore.
The last forecasts of Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is henceforth waited for at 1,1% in 2011 and at 1,4% in 2012... even though the budget in the process of examination to the Senate counts on respectively 1,3% and 2%.
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will represent still 4,3% of the GDP next year (against 3,9% foreseen by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
From where does the rumor of a new budget collective that could be put put some after the parties, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new measures of austerity will owe beings taken," values the commissioner to the economic businesses, Olli Rehn.
For the hour, Italy receives the support of the international institutions.
"The fundamental ones of his economics are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat it for long," insures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator to the International Monetary Fund in load of Italy to the IMF.
"There is not problem in the immediate one, neither on the court nor on the long term, because in spite of his important debt (119,2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of stabilization asked for in Italy are lesser that those asked to other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, economist in leader of the OECD.
Remain the question of the political instability.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in Parliament, subsequent to which of the early elections could be organized end March.
Would open then a period little propitious to the capture of decision in the event of serious crisis.
The Europeans think about the reinforcement of the mechanisms anticrisis
Christine Lagarde has still hammered it yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that still one has demonstrated it Sunday in the day and in the night, are evidently supporting, determined, encouraged to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Well that very relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of the European obligations of State has brought water to the mill of the governments and of the BCE.
But one can yet not talk about a beginning of normalization.
The agency of Standard notation & Poor's has announced that she could degrade the bill of the debt of Portugal, the target most aimed at today by the speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of light and of political visibility, which weighs notably on the banked systems," value the economists of EX ane BNP Paribas.
Accordingly more that "the political time is well slower than the time of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers that it conceals, the European countries intensify the discussions to reinforce the mechanisms anticrisis already existent.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers the more directly concerned ones and, more largely, with their peers of the G20 go good train.
And it in sight also of the meetings of the Eurogroupe and of the Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The BCE meets today.
To the menu, the fate of the not conventional measures of support to the countries of the euro zone in the collimator of the markets (to see above).
As for the European Fund of financial stability (FESF), his executive manager, Klaus Regling, has begun Tuesday in Singapore a turn of Asia to inform the investors extreme-eastern of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not of raising funds, it prepares probably the ground.
The first emissions of titles of the FESF are foreseen next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative has entrusted at the agency Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase of the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
The countries that are in first line, Portugal and Spain, as for them, prepare themselves to adopt structural reforms, notably as regards organization of the labor market.
Reforms that add to the measures of austerity to more approached effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a path different from those of Greece and of Ireland.
One and the other one insist at all costs on avoiding asking for an international help before setting up their own budget hotfixes and of deciding on the essential structural reforms to return trust lastingly.
The European backers, finally, converse on the options available for accelerating the process of normalization of the markets of the sovereign obligations.
Of passage in Paris, on November 24th, Axel Weber had the first one advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to replace the hand in the wallet.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of every foreground of the market of the European sovereign debt, judge that a leaf of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "of preference" under the form of direct injection of liquidities.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Mechanism of financial stabilization endowed, at this day, with 60 billion euros.
An advice that has all the chances of being examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of market worsened.
Snow and black ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes generate still difficulties of circulation, notably on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are henceforth orange in vigilance because of the risk of snow and of black ice.
The Eure, the Eure-and-Dormouse, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, have added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, more late in the night.
According to France Weather Forecast, showers of snow elevated affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Coats of snow going from 2 to 5 cm, punctually of 7 to 10 cm, are waited for for the concerned departments, and of 1 to 3 cm, indeed up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The concerned departments are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Coasts of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, of the Poitou and those of the regions Bass-Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are notable suffisament to generate difficulties of circulation and to disrupt some economic activities, warns France Weather Forecast.
In the Coasts of Armor, several regional have been forbidden at the heavy trucks of more of 7,5 tons, of which base them Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The circulation on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the policemen that recommend of taking his vehicle only in the event of necessity and the circulation of some coaches TER has been suspended for the day.
The school transports have been forbidden for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged Wednesday night to restrict the circulation of the heavy trucks.
The prefecture "invites to all the motorists the greatest caution on the roads and as a result to adapt their behavior."
The Directorate General of the civil air force (DGAC) has asked to the airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights on the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly because of the snowfalls to come.
The DGAC commends itself to the temporary aerial ones of contacting their company.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, to the south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Great Subway Paris: first financial sketches
For the time that the debate around the modernization of the transports in Ile-de-France beats his fullness, the billion pleuvent.
In the discussion at least.
One evokes in particular 23 billion for the subway Great Paris that must build the Society of the Great Paris.
To start up this SGP, the State has announced an endowment in capital of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical diagram, it is this sum that will allow afterwards the SGP to borrow a part of the financing of his double buckle on the markets.
Finally, today, one gets to the first additions.
The rectified finance bill 2010, examined in commission of the finances of the French National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms foreseen to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase of the tax on the offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, one reads in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment a Society of the Great Paris."
It is encoded: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros per annum."
The second is a reconversion of a tax on the offices that exists already "in order to modernize it, of increasing the product and of allocating this increase to the Society of the Great Paris."
That would bring back how much?
Mystery.
It is not encoded in the text.
One is far from the 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources add to the 4 billion" euros of the endowment in capital that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Society of the Great Paris progressively "of the project," one can read in the account reasons.
To the SGP, one does not find this shocking system.
"From the moment where one created of the receipts (the two taxes, ndlr), one can cover the studies towards three years then to hit in the 4 billion after, one explains."
"It will be noted down in the budget and pulled progressively."
The SGP considers that the 4 billion will start being noted down in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belong still to the absent subscribers, risks to cause an a bit restless parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7th.
Revengeful Hackers and spies in diligence
The business WikiLeaks has a double value.
Of a side, it reveals an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between the States, the citizens and the press.
Of the other one, it announces deep changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by the regression.
But proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is the confirmation of the fact that every file constituted by a secret service (of whatever nation that it is) is composed exclusively of breaks of press.
The "extraordinary" ones American revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi make only to report it that since months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi is an owner), and the ridiculous sinistrement profile of Khadafi was for long for the artists of matter cabaret to sketch.
The rule according to which the secret files must not be composed that of already well-known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Cross) exactly it that already was written in the previous works.
And it not only because the author of occult texts does not love to make investigations unpublished (nor does not know where to look for news on the non-existent one), but because those that are dedicated to the occultism believe only in it that they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ibidem for the secret files.
The informer is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the leader of the secret services (otherwise it could be, that I know, editor to Release), who remembers as truth only what it recognizes.
The information secret beep on Berlusconi that the American embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State were the same ones as those that Newsweek published the week of before.
Then why the revelations on these files have made so much of noise?
Of a side, they say what every cultured person knows already, that is to say that the embassies, at least from the end of the Second World War, and since the leaders of States can phone themselves or take an airplane to meet to dine, have lost their diplomatic duty and, made exception of some small exercises of representation, have transformed into centers of espionage.
Any spectator of films of inquiry knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one makes semblance of ignoring it.
Though, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to put the American diplomacy under a bad light.
In second place, the idea that an indifferent hacker can win the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world carries a not negligible blow to the prestige of the department of State.
So the scandal does not put so much in crisis the victims only the "torturers."
But turn to the deep nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive every power as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The orwellienne prophecy completely had proved since, being able to control every movement grace on the telephone, every transaction carried out, the visited hotel, the motorway taken and so forth, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of the power.
But while one demonstrates that even the crypts of the secrets of the power can not escape the control of a hacker, as that happens now, the relation of control stops being unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as avenger of the citizen -, can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power hold out that does not have the possibility of preserving his secret specificity anymore?
It is truth, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secret is not a secret space (and empty secret will never be able to be unveiled); it is truth, also, which every knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is indeed a secret empty of secret, because raising of the domain public; but revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, as WikiLeaks has made it, means to take away every power from it.
WikiLeaks has not made any fault to Sarkozy or Merkel, but he has made some a too great one at Clinton and at Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted to a very powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, the States no more will be able to put online no information reserved - that would amount to publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner of the street.
But it is tout aussi evident that with the present technologies, hoping to be able to look after confidential relations by telephone is empty.
Nothing easier only of discovering if and when a leader of State has moved by airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How the future will be able to be kept the private and reserved relations?
I know well that, for the moment, my forecasting raises science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who move in a discreet way in diligences to the unverifiable routes, in not being carrying only of messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copy in drawers closed at key: basically, the attempt of espionage of the Watergate has had less success than WikiLeaks has.
I have had the occasion of writing that the technology advances now in crab, in other words backwards.
A century after the telegraph without thread has revolutionized the communications, Internet has restored a telegraph on son (telephonic).
The videotapes (analogical) had allowed to the researchers in cinema to explore a film not to not, going backwards and forwards and in of it discovering all the secrets of the assembly, even though now the CD (numeric) allow only jumping of chapter in chapter, in other words by macroportions.
With the trains to great speed, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, then that by airplane, and the movements that it includes, three hours and a half are needed.
It is not therefore extraordinary that the policy and the techniques of communications bring back to the cars at horse.
A last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was plotted in the secret of the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for the confidential information at the press.
Climate: how does France fiddle with his promises of financings
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time of examining the respect of the promises of rapidly unblocked financings (said financings fast start or precocious) realized by the developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries have committed to supplying 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7,2 billion euros on three years and France 1,26 billions of euros (is 420 million per annum).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken out the great game to persuade his partners of the reality of his commitment regarding the fast start financings: relation detailing the action of his Member States, press conference, great side event, distribution of booklets...
The transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated to his fair value: the developping countries and the non-trading company would love that all the developed countries follow suit with a same level of precision.
The EU announces to have freed in 2010 2,2 billion from euros, what puts it on the good path for the respect of his commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But while one looks in the detail, the things are complicated more.
This money must be, according to the agreement of Copenhagen, "new and additional," in order to assure that an additional effort is realized without being public to the detriment of the Help to the development.
Unfortunately, it does not exist agreed on what means "new and additional."
Even though the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some Member States of which France have blocked the procedure.
Today, each chooses the reference that suits it the best.
The European Commission has for example considered as reference the year 2009: the international financings are maintained, and it adds 150 million to it towards three years to the title of the fast start financings.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public help to the development.
On the Other Hand, France considers that the financings of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is not reference to the expenses of the previous years or at the global level of public Help to the development.
Concretely, the total amount of the support of France at the developping countries can remain stable (or even to diminish), she claims to respect his commitment as regards "new and additional" financings...
Other crucial element, the distribution between gifts and loans.
There still, there is not rule and each chooses his way of calculation.
Some, as France, consider lent qu'1€ is tantamount at 1 € given.
Evidently, that is in a difficult way justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often of the projects related to the alleviation of the emissions that rest on more efficient technologies), presenting a euro that one is going to recover as equivalent to a euro that one gives is fallacious... At most, should not be counted to the title of his commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country (is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France does not have that to make of such a reasoning: it "respects" his commitment of 420 million euros making 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% of gifts (36,1 million euros) - to see the document of the EU to verify by yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use so massively the loan.
Germany summons to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or the Slovakia (in other) respect their commitments with 100% of gifts.
In other words, when the very great majority of the European Union takes 1 € to satisfy his commitment, France takes only 10 centimes and considers that the effort is comparable.
Pretty trick!
In summary, in his fast start financing, France operates on a double swindle: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in the time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
Using only 36,1 million euros, she manages to make to believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in coherence with his promises.
The handling of the ministry of the Finances (because it seems well that it is Bercy that has realized the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why the other Member States would continue fall if stretching suffices?) and in the negotiations since the developping countries are not completely dupe...
The chapter of the precocious financings is only a small question, of short relative term, in relation to the unity of the discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the immense machine than the UNFCCC is.
Hope that that will not be the case.
Which that it is, it is essential to get out the lessons of this first year of precocious financings.
First and Foremost, the France could announce a change in his way of comptabilisation for the years 2011 and 2012, in a mind of respect of his commitments and of equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially, the France could make advance the discussions on the stakes of financings in the long term (other crucial chapter discussed presently): one will not escape the question of "the additionalité" or of the way of comptabilisation of the loans.
France could change his position for also progressive evolution on these stakes as it is it on others.
The hope rests therefore on the new minister of the Environment, Mme Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive to Cancun next week.
An announcement discovered on the fast start of France and on his vision of "the additionalité" and the use of loans would be by nature to increase the level in trust international necessary to advance in the discussions.
