The lack of snow in the mountains worries total
The barren slopes don't worry about just krkonošským vlekařům.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
It is therefore in the Giant Mountains still get free rooms for all winter dates, including the Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors at our website.
People pass through the offer shall record prices, but so far they fear made a firm order.
And if you call upon us, we are now asking if we are going to be this year ’ s Christmas in the snow or mud, "said the manager of an information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants a new residence in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your own preference, I would not hesitate to match the order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is for him to take second place, it could still try to wait a couple of days.
Meanwhile, hotels are offering Špindlerovští on New Year's Eve, mostly weekly stays.
I think it will seek to sue for a while, but then they also permit, and they'll go for a shorter period of time.
And then they will be available rooms quickly disappear, "he estimated Jandura.
Open beds in all winter dates still offers vrchlabská travel agency INGTOURS.
Now, most of us are interested in Christmas week, which is not yet vyprodán.
Even so, half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That is why we have set a cheaper holiday stays at the last minute, "said the director Petr Ingtoursu Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains vrchlabská travel agent can still offer, too, but there are fewer vacancies.
All right at the disposal is also the first two weeks of February, while the winter dates are sold on average.
Earlier this year, interest in the winter holidays affects the fact that in the Giant Mountains is still not snow.
People take a wait-and-see approach, if you want.
No one wants to spend the end of the year without the snow on the mountains.
If during the week, snowy slopes, vyprodají, even Christmas, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year, the hotel rooms boast Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five per cent better.
On New Year's Eve, even on Christmas Day we have in the last few places.
The big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "said the director of the hotel peckého Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year's Eve stays in Omnia Hotel, near the central car park in Lázně since.
On the contrary, Christmas remains in the latest hotel janskolázeňském even half the beds available.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, who already have at this moment, made up of about 60 percent.
Yet there is a bit of a weak February, however, when the snow comes, the demand for package holidays in the Giant Mountains must still be rises, said the hotel manager Omnia Eric Sporysch.
However, the larger presents the snow krkonošští hotels, meanwhile, must have come taste.
On Thursday, it is cool, if there are any reductions, we should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, he has come to the warming, said Jiří Jakubský hydrometeorologického from Hradec workplaces of the Czech constitution.
The US: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is as ridiculous as the schoolgirl snaživostí Barack Obama, the president with a reputation as the smartest, repeated in Afghanistan's ruling the strategy of his predecessor, whom he regarded as the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly-anticipated Afghan doctrine, have been found to have plagiarized over carbon's missing from the Bush ’ s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the centre of the text repeatedly uses the word turnover, "as in Iraq", but he did not hesitate even to use the name of the Bush statement from January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "New way forward".
Three years ago, at the same time, he criticized Bush's idea to send a fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decision".
The subsequent months have shown, however, that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from field commanders were the only possible and veleúspěšnou enough sessions today in the intelligence on Iraq.
Bush's reputation improvement, but objectively left his successor a much passed the default position than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan he hopes Barack Obama in that the miracle repeats.
The increase in military contingent asked him again field commanders, in particular, the top Afghan commander Gen. Stanley McCristal operation that even despite subordinačním practices he criticized harshly quelled the shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men in order to break the situation for the better.
The president of the three-month hesitated, but nothing else to think, and so at least he defrauded general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe could squeeze out the promise of further 5 thousands, although he was initially charged with at least 10.
On the whole Nejproblematičtějším Obama ’ s strategy appears to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan already in 18 months and end this process in three years. The Obama Doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half-measures will increase the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite underpinned internecine wars of the last years of Iraqi society is relatively well ordered, its leaders to honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite sign - for anyone could not count on any agreement and non-compliance.
Wrong, under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used day to change the master in as far as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they will be formally constituted, will remain just Potěmkinovou village, for which will continue to spread patriarchal tribal relations.
Balance of interests between different ethnic groups, it is extremely difficult, given the nepřehlednosti ratios, which will further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of "akceschopného state", which is a minimalist goal of the entire operation, it doesn't look like all too real.
Obama ’ s strategy at the time horizon of its voluntarismem.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated only, and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the soldier boys sent into the fray with a view to "an early return home" will cause here, only the soul may actually be a romantic, matters little.
From a political point of view is to set a date for withdrawal of troops by nezodpovědností, since the Taliban, it will be seen as an implicit admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans ’ willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing the red.
European politicians can't and don't want to explain to voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is connected to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush has given.
Another factor is capable of the radical to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and intensified sanctions on the Iranians does not produce arises from the United States přetěžká question is, will not try to solve the problem of the use of military force.
You will have to respond to it at a time when the Obama ’ s America to enforce the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such deal would mark a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only politics for Barack Obama is that the remaining presidential election three years away, so there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop in.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs has won ’ t pay in cash
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs this year won ’ t pay in cash.
Announced that the company, which responds to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive cash in lieu of shares that could be sold as soon as possible in five years.
In addition, managers shares may be removed in the event that they will be overly risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency put at the forefront of efforts to link bonuses on Wall Street, with long-term performance.
I suspect that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction, which needs to issue, a former investment banker with JP Morgan, said the company Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become a target of criticism after they took over the first three quarters of this year, set aside almost $17 billion (nearly $300 billion USD) in rewards.
The total amount of bonuses in the company for this year, according to the Reuters agency reported today, despite the measures likely to exceed $20 billion.
High remuneration in the banking sector, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a number of countries have become a hot political issue.
Britain on Wednesday announced that it intends to bankers ’ bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds (about $712.000 USD) in a lump sum to a 50% tax.
A similar steps as France prepares.
Earlier this year, the women have won the Nobel Prize in all sectors except physics
A record five women in Stockholm today took over from the hands of the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf at this year ’ s Nobel Prize for Literature and professional classes.
In addition to the four scientists between them was a German writer Herta M. of Romanian origin.
The Nobel Prize in medicine have received two American biologists Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburnová together with their compatriot Jack Szostakem for research in the field of chromosomes.
She received the award for chemistry Izraelka Ada Jonathová, together with the Americans Venkatramanem Ramakrishnanem and Thomas Steitzem for clarification of the structure and function of ribozomů.
The last laureátku was the Nobel Prize for economics, which received the American Elinor Ostromová and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for analysis of economic governance.
The only technical categories, which this year has passed off without držitelky, was a physics.
This award today scientists carried Charles Kao for research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with Willardem Boylem for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each valued took a diploma, a Nobel medal and certificate of profit of financial rewards.
The totals for each category of the 10 million Swedish kronor (about $25 million CZK).
If a Commendation List in each of them more reward will be divided among themselves.

In defense of its policy, but he added that the war is in a situation that required for commanders of peace, even if the price is high.
Marek Alexa minister is considering resignation. Klaus had invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduardo Janotu, which is considering whether to remain in the government, because it does not agree with the nature of the state budget for the coming year, as it was approved by the House of Commons on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps even Janotovo remain in office will be the topic of Friday's meeting.
The budget also criticized Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, further deepening the crisis in the public finances.
The meeting of the President's spokesman said Radim new government.
On its next term in office Marek Alexa wants to act on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischerem.
According to the law of the budget, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on the movement of money and raise money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the suggestions of social democracy that secretly by increasing the budget deficit.
Left on one side and the Government, Klaus and the right wing, on the other hand, a dispute has arisen because of a sharp vnitropolitický, which begins to raise a question mark over the additional exposure habitually Fischer's cabinet, which was agreed in the spring-making the ODS party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by the House of Representatives, practically destroyed a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has imposed in the fall, and that has to stop borrowing state.
Klaus, who has a law on the state budget may or may not sign on today's news breakfast with business, said that politicians neglected for an extended period, "a serious problem" which is "unsustainable deficitnost" of public finances.
Today, according to him, he has a good solution.
Better would produce a strong government, which could have been based on a broad consensus of political parties, is the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolanek said that the budget is awesome, and the government should consider the further existence.
ODS-Petr Nečas said that the concept of habitually cabinet, with the support of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the ODS has obviously doesn't work.
Prime Minister Fischer, in response, called similar words for "strong statements".
The head of the Czech Jiri Paroubek on Topolánek responded that the budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government prepares for this year, which is more than 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday called the Czech approval of the state budget for the coming year for success.
Satisfied they were also lidovci.
Mandela in the novelty of Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say that a new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated is denounced by the world a lot about the country, about her fight and win despite some critiques that the main role ztvárňují American actors.
The story is about a sport, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela.
The indefatigable warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa as its first black president, Nelson Mandela in his life story represents oscarový American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked whether he would be in the movie Eastwoodově reproduce.
Another important role in it plays Matt Damon.
I told him: 'If I play, I'll have to have access.
72-year-old actor, who won the prize for her role in the drama of the environment of the boxing Eastwoodově million Dollar Baby, enacted, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, which ultimately became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god of the goddess Evanovi, but it is rare for someone who is still alive and is so important for many people like Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work after the end of apartheid in South Africa.
To freedom in 1990 and has been going for four years, then became the president of the country.
In 1993, he received the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is the Latin word for the undefeated, and it is the name of the author of the English poet William Ernest Henleyho published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk as he
Slide is a true story about how Nelson Mandela has joined forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pienaarem to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite people through sport, so decides to unify the rugby players who belong on a global scale between the Outsiders.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman had been working for several years to Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role, so as not to approach her as much as reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was that to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world policies were in the same area, he would've tried to meet with him, to have dinner with him, be backstage before his utterance.
The most important thing was that Mandela wanted to shake hands.
I found that if I wrapped around his hand, take your energy, transfers, and I felt that I know how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
In the film, starring Matt Damon François Pienaara, the captain of the national football team in which převažovali white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the tough world of football.
In the end, it was a big surprise for him when they first met Pienaarem in his house.
I remember how I rang the bell at the front door, he opened the door and the first thing I François Pienaarovi in his life, he said, was: 'In the film look much larger.
Despite obvious differences in the characters of the actors in comparison with their real pattern under the guidance of director Eastwood received Invictus: Undefeated positive reviews, and speaks to the ambitions for an Oscar.
Film critic of The Daily Variety's Todd McCarthy summed up in the words: "It was a very good story, very well-made movie."

The secret glow above Norway rozluštěno: The Russians tested a missile
In Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
Russia's Defense Ministry yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border wife, an intercontinental ballistic missile.
It was the Start menu, but again failed, and the shot known as type "Bulava, which originally was supposed to be the envy of the Russian army is slowly becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his recurring presence at test missiles on the success of the test flights did not have the proper effect.
The majority of all Bulava nevzlétla or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers are already on the "Bulavě" writes as "rocket, which don't fly".
The rocket, which don't fly but it
This, in order for the 13th experiment took place at first normally.
Once again, at the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the line.
Apparently, the engine in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" taking off from a nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket that can be fired from the vessel, which is on the move, and at the same time submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light above Norway, caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first time they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
By this time, the generals and argue that we cannot speak clearly about the failure.
The first two stages of the rocket had fallen and the accident suffered the third.
In previous cases, the porouchaly engines in the first instance.
Though not a perfect one test launch, under the leadership of the Department of Defense considers failed, only six out of thirteen.
The success of the generals is nearly a 50% rise in optimism, and so he still claims that "Bulava" one will be operated without any problems and that he can carry up to 10 nuclear hypersonických blocks of a maximum of the total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed in 51 years of annual contract in the Central Army Moscow
The legendary quarterback Vyacheslav Fetisov, in 51 years will once again in the professional game hokejovém.
A former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup in need of assistance to his team Central Army Moscow and will probably already in Friday's match against St Petersburg KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the Central Army.
After he was injured Denis Kuljaš, badly in need of another quarterback.
Fetisov regularly trains, and agreed that the team will help.
We just need to resolve any formal requirements, the agency cited the AP Coach of the Moscow club Sergei Němčinova.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey players will involve only one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of the other players, he said Němčinov.
Fetisov, according to the AP, in the case of a return to the ice will become the oldest Russian playing professional hockey.
At the age of 51 different place in the NHL all season for Hartford, the legendary striker Gordie Howe and wrote a 15 goals and 26 assistance.

Hyundai has complied with the unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the aid Hyundai with the unions agreed to cancel all of overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným přesčasům stávkovou unions on Monday declared a state of emergency.
It was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
Management, however, wants to trade unionists to agree even on one of this year ’ s Saturday shift.
We can ’ t resign on our production schedule, it is vital, therefore, was designed to be voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, with the result that would have made two shifts, said Vaněk.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that company employees who work Saturday shift, offered a bonus of CZK 400.
That will get people back to work Saturday, 28 November.
The company is according to the member of staff decided to change the way of motivating the proposed overtime.
You can be used to pay for overtime pay, or they can choose a replacement during the day on 28 December, and thus have a day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees Saturday shifts will be paid for the fare, and lunch.
Whereas the amount of overtime and were nejurgentnějším nejpalčivějším point from the point of view of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and protesters employees, irresistibly stopped production last week, so management has decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to remove any overtime for the month of December, he said Vaněk.
Staff car companies were last week forced to virtually every day after an eight-hour shift work in a two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the union stávkovou emergency appeal
Further negotiations between the carmakers and the union is expected to take place on Friday morning.
The union chief Petr Kuchař on Wednesday said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign off on a joint document, they are ready to revoke the emergency stávkovou.
The situation came to a head last week not start working on Wednesday, with about 400 employees spontaneously stávkovalo because of the constant přesčasům.
Also protested against the poor pay and conditions of the alleged maltreatment.
Duct lived that overtime workers must do for the sake of the requirements for the supply of cars.
The union, in its Monday announcement strike ER also requested that they weren't any sanctions postihováni employees who last Wednesday cut production.
In the field of overtime unions after the company required in order to stem the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, the estimated cost for this year to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns.
The Nošovice industrial manufacturer Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series production company rode in November last year.
In September this year it produced roughly 80,000 vehicles, its current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year.
Český discovery: A substance that works on the HIV virus' scars'
A team of Czech and German scientists testing the new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of enhanced substance is that it works and the viruses that have won against drugs immunity.
In some cases, this fact outweighed by the fact that the compound on a normal variant of the virus doesn't seem to be as hard as some already available medicines.
The disease AIDS still cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly extended the life of a combination of drugs that prevent the virus replication of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a series of side effects.
Partial suppression of propagation of the virus has also resulted in the development of the so-called resistentních viruses against which the drugs are ineffective.
Labor experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Praha and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
It proves that a substance called metalokarborany operate on proteins responsible for the propagation of the virus HIV.
Are compounds Metalokarborany boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way than all of the drugs used today, and they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work of the scientists come with the new ‘ souped-up his improved ’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their ties to the viral proteins.
Metalokarborany have a unique three-dimensional structure: Two-faceted cage made of atoms of boron and hydrogen and carbon, are connected by a metal, in this case kobaltem.
Treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV proteáza HIV is a protein, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteázou caused by the fission of HIV would not ripe infectious virus particles.
If we stop HIV proteázu, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In work published in the scientific journal Journal of the medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) interconnected short organic chain, which is also systematically revised.
A slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV proteáze has been tested in vitro fertilization and also against its sturdy (rezistentním) varieties obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the variant of the enzyme to normal metalokarboranů is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but its effect does not for resistant variants against which are used drugs are often ineffective.
A unique mechanism of action and its other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of another chemical treatments of metalokarboranů makes interesting compounds for further research leading to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pauline Mobil, head of the lab Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the sake of the budget. The CDP has embarked on Fischer, that will prevent
In this sense Mirek Topolanek marked by an approved budget for next year as "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, he should consider the further existence.
Expression of the Czech prime minister called for a strong statements.
He said that the time for analysis.
ODS-Petr Nečas said that the draft habitually cabinet, with the support of the Social Democrats, the Green Party and the ODS has obviously doesn't work.
Prime Minister is increasingly in demand, according to minister Nečas must decide whether he intends to lean on the minority in the House, which is about the struggle with rising deficits, or for him to remain in office, with the help of parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy on the issue of public sector deficits is fundamentally different, "said Nečas.
The House on Wednesday adopted a budget for 2010, with the country ’ s amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House had raised the money for the salaries of state employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of the Government's proposals to address social democracy was still hidden by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, act on the request of the government, so that even the revised budget is less bad than a variant of the budgetary surrogate.
To disappointment and
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation yet.
Nečas is convinced that if a mazivy seriously threaten leaving functions in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television ordered a mazivy on Monday after the government of the prime minister.
At the same time, he indicated that it was considering further continuation in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If the Fischer speaks for another fight with the deficit for the budget, they are increasingly in demand, according to minister Nečas in government to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also be sure to say that the demise, if the House approves the additional laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to health, income, or the amendments to the Staff of the law.
Topolánek: Ministers of the ODS party nominees neprovinili
It is a matter of the prime minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS party nominees ministers haven't done anything wrong, "Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that on several ministries are in náměstkovských features people, causing TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if the Fischer has decided to resign from the principle of the fight with the amount of the government deficit, "it is completely logical and correct that, against a leftist majority that is currently in the House's".
But then he can count on support from the Civil Democrats and tolerance.
I hadn't thought about it, and when it is the current, so that you can spend, he told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Barták, whom the government was nominated at the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon flew at a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the prime minister stepped ODS
Nečas also stressed that the party would seem to be in the House on Wednesday voted against an amended budget, if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats expressly requested that the adoption of the budget allowed.
Nepřipadáme as orphans, we're not children, then responded to the question of whether the ODS party in political negotiations over the budget speechless absence of the Chairman of the parties in parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice was missing.
When I was giving the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months, it will be a member of the House bolševizaci and destruction of all positive, "he said.
Under the new schedule, Czech Railways trains will go under for almost the same fare
České dráhy from 13 December will cancel or reduce some of the less-frequent rychlíky and local, the other joint on the other hand, the stronger.
The total amount of traffic from the date of the validity of the new timetable will decrease compared with today by two percentage points.
The majority of fares, including basic, and a customer fare changes.
More options for a connection to the capital gain, for example, residents Ostravska, track on this route add one set of Pendolino.
On the contrary, the high-speed train stops to ride to Bratislava.
Also, less fast trains moving along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, significantly reduces the direct connections between Prague – Neverwinter.
The regions are planning to track the largest reduction in traffic in the region, evidently, a total of eight percent, to increase, on the other hand, can look forward to Prague and its surrounding areas.
It also removes a two-night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and operation of several fast trains along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct route from Milovic to Prague, today must switch in Milovičtí Lysá nad Labem.
The fifteenth line of peri-urban system of Esca, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovic.
The long-haul flights to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more connections between Prague and Ostrava SC Pendolino trains and into Šumperka / Jeseník will go on a two-hourly intervals.
The Pendolino train to Bratislava, from December 13 passengers already nesvezou.
This year ’ s bill for regional rail: About $200 million more
Rychlíky orders and paid by the Department of Transportation, the total loss could prove to be the so-called Railways CZK 4 billion next year, as well as this year. Local ’ re-pay them next year, for a total of eight billion crowns, with 2.9 billion regions will happen.
This year's regional trains about 200 million more expensive.
I have had great influence on the runway rychlíky newly signed a ten-year contract, has always been a contract for one year.
The runway system pochvalují, and therefore presumably to increase the stock price of an overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only in the overnight network tickets ČD Net and cheap internet ticket Eliska.
For people without the customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to CZK 600 million.
Price Elišky will be newly-based on distance travelled, has not yet been for the journey between any regional cities uniform and was $160 million.
Filipino militants still holds more than 50 people, including the Children
Today, militants in the south of the Philippines was kidnapped 75 people, including several of primary school pupils and their teachers.
It said the agency AFP, which initially reported only about 65 hijacked.
All 17 children were detained after eight hours have been released, including one teacher.
The abduction occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 of the armed men allegedly used hostages as a shield during the run from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police originally kidnapper pursued because of the violence, which has cost a settling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which were killed 57 people, declared martial law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November associated with the election to office guvernérského was 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre was arrested the governor of the province, and his father Andal jihofilipínské Ampatuan, an influential patriarch of the genus Ampatuanů.

It said Dvaceti Jančura within minutes in Chief.
Action is linked to the company's efforts to operate a regional train service in certain regions of the country.
But in the end, all regions have signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three hejtmani attacks against us, and they talk about the fact that we choose the raisins, while we brought in a bid only on what they wanted.
He argues that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were concluded last week.
So we have to defend myself.
It's a slander against the company Student Agency, said Czech RadioJournal) Jančura.
At the same time, he says that there is evidence from all counties that have their steps in accordance with the European law.
Therefore preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Prodáváme filing criminal notification is deemed to be the continued media show Mr Jančury, which serves as free advertising by his company and his own party.

Vaccination against pneumokokům will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against pneumokokům down since January, followed by older practices.
It is to be a first for families, free of charge, and at the same time, on a voluntary basis.
We don ’ t have the votes, it would be compulsory vaccination more efficient.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokům culminates.
Ústav lékový already set the maximum price for vaccines, which will pay for health insurance companies.
The experts have also have clear in the implementation of the vaccination.
The new vaccination
For free vaccines for the August children
Since January, free of charge, may be vaccinated against pneumokokům children, who were born last August 2, and later.
The only condition is that he still does not even one dose of the vaccine.
Who began to vaccinate or early last year, he must pay for itself, as well as other booster.
The first dose of vaccine should be made between 3 and 5 month the age of the child.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumokokům a quarter of families.
At the same time, parents paid 1,600 crowns per dose, and more.
The vaccination of the youngest children are the need for four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that a health care insurer shall issue on the vaccine doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year.
But you'll save on therapy to children without vaccination needed.
So far, the state of the vaccination for all children gave about $500,000 a year.
The vaccination was introduced at the expense of so-called Janotovým package.
The pneumococcus is caused by inflammation of the middle ear, but also a serious infections including zánětů brain fever and blood poisoning.
The pneumokokové infections in a year, according to a survey of us die in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years old.
In addition to the Czech Republic have paid a vaccination of children against pneumokokům circa in 40 countries.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
At the same time, but that it would in the future could be the vaccination compulsory.
Since January has to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
The compulsory vaccination could have been better, he suggested, for example, the head of the civic association Speak up Rudolf Kalovský.
The association promotes pneumokokové vaccines in the long term.
The experts at the International Conference, which is part of our association, they weren't entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that he managed to push through at least this.
I think that's the road that now we have to step in, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but the vaccination against pneumokokům wants to change.
At this point, we're not talking about it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The President The company practical children ’ s doctors Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children have been vaccinated, it might seem that a reduction in the number of booster "For a situation where this vaccine costs so high amount, rather we understand the political decisions that vaccination was started as a volunteer," she says, of course, Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against pneumokokům from next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumokokům is a breakthrough, and that it was the first area of the vaccination of children is paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies would have to pass the money on prevention, save it for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will be forced to buy drugs alone
But it is worried about the practical children ’ s doctors involved in purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intention had vaccines to purchase insurance companies and doctors would receive similar, as they become adds substance to the rest of the vaccination.
But some MPs are worried that they could give assurance "took the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy a substance and wait until they will pay for the insurance.
According to estimates by child primary-care doctors will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a significant amount of money.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.

It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the building and minarets and generally spread alarm reports of alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a brief, whether they are allowed to integrate Muslims - and whether they will integrate - into one of the continent nejotevřenějších secular society.
Some of the readers, after reading this book admirers became the artist's final works, "Why the French do not like scarves on the head" (2006), this elegant and diskutovanou study on the issues that divide and employ the country for over a period of 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
The last book of Mr Bowen has a broader and much more ambitious in scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now worried about 5 ÷ 6 million of French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic premises".
He is a good listener, reproduce debate between teachers and students about the issues that are most worried about.
Should a Muslim enter into matrimony in the mosque or at the town hall (or in both places)?
It should be taught about the development of young Muslim and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim married to a man who is not a Muslim?
He has the right to use of a Muslim zájmově oriented banking system, if it wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, which are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than a political drama, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers, intellectuals, among other well-known person, including Tarika Ramadana, Arab, Muslim explorer and academic, who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate about how it can also be a good Muslim, and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all of their habits.
The conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists that Mr Bowen conducted interviews, on the belief that they are the counterpart Selafiho purists — supporters of Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia — this group is small, but it affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires give and take on both sides.
It wonders how far they are French politicians (and intellectual elite that so obstinately defends the general public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the view that Muslims are in matters of faith may have less experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make the historic compromise with secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism has detected a "tightening bolts of values".
It may be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

Anti-graffiti and language are considered a serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogující community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchezovou, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to be able to accept the prize, but was denied permission.
The detention of an American contractor may be the result of the growing tension between the Communist Castrovým brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was tracked as a "delaying tactics" in improving relations with the island.

Staff administration rozkrývají Pakistánští conspiracy, concerning the broadcast men into Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday, uncovered the alleged leader of the plot, involving the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American forces, and said they hope that such a case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists verbířů that he's on the internet and finds radikalizované young men.
Investigators have suggested that the search for a gray guerrilla leaders, known as Saifulláh, who invited the man to Pakistan after it was first discovered when one of these men posted a comment, the authorising terristické videostránce attacks on the website YouTube.
Saifilláh assumed leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the zone of indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its camps for training terrorists.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that Saifulláh usvědčování was unsuccessful in al-Qaeda commanders, and that the men were part of an attempt by the CIA infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they are dumped after a few days in the eastern district Sarghody, far from the forbidding mountains in the north-west, which has become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as a squad.
That is why they disembark, said the official, who spoke on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were scared away and still trying to get approval to gain access to the camps of al Qaeda, when they were arrested by law enforcement pakistánského.
In this case, the five - which remained in Pakistan and the FBI vyslýchána - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important to determine who is trusted.

Enterprise náboráři act as sentries vyřazující those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
The American mock recruits were conquered by al-Qaida special scrutiny, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because due to their potential access to U.S. goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at Nef Foundation, based in the US, said that the terrorist group has also become, in recent years, significantly more cautious in Koh demonstrates that came up to them, because the American intelligence agencies to recruit experts on their recruitment methods.
If you try to penetrate the groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already much-watched? Said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those who is far more based on the Web site.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanded a climate 'action'.
Tens of thousands of protesters marching through the streets this Saturday and pressed for stronger action on climate change negotiators from the convention center in the city's Bella.
Many hundreds of thousands of protesters have cited the number of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the centre of town.
On the day of the party at the talks about climate change, which UN-sponsored, thousands of activists around the city and carried banners with English "This is not a planet B" (i.e., the second-rank) and one in španěltštině, which read "Earth saying 'enough'."
The protest took part in a number of celebrities including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensenové, which indicated that vycestovala to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and gave me information about the dismal state of the country, which has the effect of climate change, which still occurs.
It's part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great march -- through the world, and to appeal to leading figures in the world to present a fair, ambitious and binding treaty, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, unable to continue to avoid.
Police prevented the protesters to converge on the centre of Bella, and said it had arrested 19 people, primarily because they either had worn masks or carrying had a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the other spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů about climate change activists masked as athletes and in black suits placed several pipe bombs near the main Copenhagen, which is located near several ministries.
Agitovali buildings, said zahajivali lights, but followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to be entered into the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese negotiator on climate change.
When he was asked if it was a constructive demonstration of the impact on the international agenda, he replied in English, “ Actually, that is something that I was not aware of "(actually it's something neuvědomuji).
Then continued čínčtině and said, "because it was the site of a large-scale, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He was the march of painful or helpful depending on the outlook for everyone.
You can see the focus to the general public and the various sectors and the scope of climate change, he said.
In other words: "I can also say that this is a breach of conduct or the freedom of other people.
The date of the test revealed the persistent racial disparities
The federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics, it was a welcome element of good news about the public school district of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the rest of the country's highly efficient systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils and čtvrtých osmých classes over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last atestačního numbers of the National Center for progress in school are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameričany and white students, and that both the local and the national.
The average result of white pupils čtvrtých classes of the District of Columbia over the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but, as with their peers afroamerických nrůstu occurred only by three points, from 209 at 212.
The difference in the knowledge economy actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress on the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the departure of a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was too small.
Image in term of six years, is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black students čtvrtých classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was made in a district represented 60 points on a scale (262-to-202).
Although this result in children from oboiu groups improved during this period, the difference is hardly near 58.
Some advocates of education in the county in the last week indicated that the results, the secretary oslavované Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were for white students generally stimulated where there were already high results.
That would imply that we increase the total aid for those at the higher end of the scale, which is difficult and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
I'm not exactly jumping up and down for the sake of the diffusion of two or three points, a member of the committee, said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter at the Fourth Street Elementary School in Eatonu.
Often, management style kritizujíce Mrs Rheeové, Mrs Brown said the announcement of the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and demands attention.
It is clear that you want to see the virtues, and I respect that.
But what is frightening, that we are paying almost no time and energy that had to be paid to our middle schools.
Mrs Rheeová said that the district is continuing in search of better ways of addressing the needs of the students with low results.
Thus, for example, are some of the teachers trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, Wilson of reading, aimed at students in higher classes in primary schools and secondary-school students who were unable to master the basics of reading before in his kolní kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
The day-to-day math curriculum and teaching math to sixth grade, emphasizing the game and experience of real life that came into the district as a former Director Clifford Janeyiho is attributable to the progress of the NAEP, which has been the subject of a report last week.
And I think we should continue to work and carry out the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of a class, said Ms. Rheeová.
Others have suggested that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Ms. Rheeová svyšování can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for reducing the difference.
It's a definite dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she studies the results of the tests in urban areas.
Correction of the conventional method is to target resources and administrative reforms at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So it can focus on generating the political repercussions, which is directed against the important agenda.
But, of course, a rebuke to the rest of the city's directors, who are trying to keep the middle prúměr between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We have utužit affinity of our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be provided an excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, he said in an interview this week that a fundamental element of the reduction in the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county to take the legitimacy of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days in order to push through changes, said Mr Janey, who has entered into a contract with the teachers ’ union last school year in the length of the 185 days, which is considered to be the "flag" for the search for a greater increase in the next year.
To make higher education as part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into Gettysburgské tracks with a loud panting.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, and for a moment, she was on the white columns, brick facades and emerald-green lawns.
Parents Gracielini hardly attended high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela alone, who was born in Silver Spring and live in Riverdale, never came to the land of the track.
Now she and other pupils eighth grade in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was 38690 dollars per year, their position was rather than scared visitors enthusiasm for potential students.
Yes, that's it! "She exclaimed Graciela, which would like to study medicine, if the wizard offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Oh, really? "She said thoughtfully, as they betrayed the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvánská track was one of the seven, who visited on his three-day trip, and now they are preoccupied with the message of the future: The question is not whether you enter the house.
The question is, where.
Of course, it is a soaring problem dealing with a high number of children born in the US, Spanish immigrants who are excluded from the universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get the college education, and then enter into the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "duhé generation" of Spanish students from the college - a remarkable achievements indicate that many of their parents' imigrantských, a majority of Mexicans and Central America, came to the United States, without finished high school.
Their story of success is important, the researchers say, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that has played a marginal role in the work force in the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have a natural náklonpost to the school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Too many of them had parents who put their children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education system.
But the school programs also play a special role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to have undergone the track - particularly if these efforts in time persists.
When looking to ensure that children from low-income families pocházeji whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them norientovat in the system, any simple hit in every single point, it didn't work, says Patricia Gándara, explorer at the University of California at Davis, where she studied the students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about this in order to provide these children záchytnou network in preschool age in all ways to pročšly University.
A federal program to fund a trip Graciely on track, it's a useful example.
Known as Gear UP (připtravit), provides more than $300 million a year for the local school systems for starting college preparatory programs that used for students from families with incomes of middle schools and continue until these students quit high school.
Since 1999, the programme served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the tracks, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get a major oil company to rebuild their anemic infrastructure in two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten of the agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the reconstruction of Iraq ’ s oil industry, paralyzed decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with capital participation on two out of 10 vydražených fields.
Seven US companies pay for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has lost a bid.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreement on the field, which has been Dražena in June.
The paltry participation by the American oil giants in an open Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and U.S. companies here in the first place on the path of Asians and Europeans, said the Rube Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Safety concerns, highlighted by a massive bombing on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of American forces are likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third-largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
In some cases, American businesses are at a disadvantage, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more likely to risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
The companies Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. is the only U.S. companies, which have entered into an agreement with the Ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contact with Iraqi Ministry of Oil, and to offer technical assistance in the past few years, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholder in two of the contracts that have been committed at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. contributed to the menus at more contracts than any other company, and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company would be comparable to the competition and follow through on their commitments to Iraq.
The companies, which have been pre-selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the Treasury is willing to pay to boost output above the current level in every field.
A top al-Qaeda planner may have been killed in Pakistan.
While the impact of the American missiles near the border between the disputed by Pakistan and Afganistánem this week may have been killed by a top al Qaeda operations planner, as announced on Friday, officials from the U.S. Department of the NYPD.
What is confirmed, it would be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs, who were killed when a few of the rockets landed in čtvrtrek on their car near the town of Miran Śáh Sevverní Vaziristan in the province, according to US sources and pakisttánských officials in the area.
Local authorities ounámily that rockets were launched from unmanned aircraft type, which operates the CIA in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
Those were targeted in a white car, which was heading to the Afghan border, when it was hit, said the official, together with pakistánskou cicilní intelligence agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local militants the approach to a point, and quickly zabavilito, what was left of "totally devastated".
Local authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. officials NYPD nespecifikovaného department had cited a witness who said he was a Somali Show poi death.
Somali has been cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda planner military operations, who drove the operation of groups of terrorists outside the area of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the zosnovávání throughout the world, said the senior official, who did not wish to be named, citing the sensitive nature of American air strikes in the territory of Pakistan.
If he held a central position, may have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda's top leadership, and on the basis of them planned for possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that Somali advanced rapidly in the hierarchy of the al-Qaida, and he was well connected to the rest of the extremist groups in the region.
He did not need to be widely known person for some Americans, but that was in no way neponižoval in front of us and our allies posed for it, said another official.
His death was confirmed, the Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban were to be killed since September, when he was killed in a similar attack Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant faction in the Gaza indigenous tribes and three other top poperativní leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA's unmanned aerial aircraft since the summer decreased from an average of approximately six transactions per month for a couple, well, according to the Long War Journal, a Web page maintained by the nonprofit group.
The reduction may be the reason for the improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability that also ruthlessly kill persons to whom they suspect that there are informers, said Page.
Summit delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has resigned.
Summit delegate to the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide's Comprehensive Review, said Friday that he would step down from his of his or her office in March, and so end a stormy tenure, which was mařeno allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eideho occurs because the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the surge, but expressed concern that the timing of the US for a reduction in the state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the government of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan nationals of security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they have to have confidence in the international community, "Eide's Comprehensive Review said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Adopted by the commitment must be long-term.
Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide's Comprehensive Review said that nerezignuje, but that simply fulfilling a promise he had made to his family in March 2008, in Kabul spends only two years.
It stated that he wanted to make a report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said it would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look after a successor, said Eide's Comprehensive Review.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the officials of the UN, Ban began the search for a refund.
Officials said that will be decided between Staffanem di Misturou, which has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously headed the United Nations mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhennem, a Frenchman who, before the UN-led peacekeeping operations.
Eideho position in Afghanistan was tested by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraithovi, who was accused in September President Hamidem Karzáím, who won the presidential election of camouflage, the presence of a massive electoral machinations.
Eide's Comprehensive Review denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha -- who was released -- "I would affect the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide's Comprehensive Review stated that the proposed a meeting with the chief representative of citizens for the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of US forces in Afghanistan.
I, too, for the leadership of the United Nations to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries, which is zapůjčily for the Afghan mission, because it would, he says, he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is utilized properly.
Eide's Comprehensive Review expressed disappointment over the limits of its efforts in Afghanistan and noted that cumbersome regulation on the hiring of undermine its ability to take advantage of the skills.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain since May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose on Iran "significant additional sanctions" because of a lack of commitment to talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip through the areas where they are at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, he has the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, said in response to a question of a soldier on the likely evolution. ¨
One of the things that depend on me, is whether or not I learnt about something from Iraq over the past six years, [that] is a wide distribution unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration will be decided on a package of sanctions which could hit iránskou military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iránce.
He said that "a package of incentives and restraints" would require "iránskou that forced the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will be extremely suffer" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged a European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the Committee of the UN's nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wants to return to talks on reducing their nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of their stockpiles of enriched uranium in return for badly needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has dealt with such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to allow time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is stepping down from the interim agreements - partly because the expert because irámské leadership is split on whether or not to engage with the United States.
To be honest, as it relates to the Iranian Commander Farragut against the international community, in the case of some of the proposals, which was agreed at the beginning of October, I think that brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the road, which is on the terminology of additional sanctions against Iráncům, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before resuming the search for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "degradujícími sanctions".
In its opinion, issued in New York, Iran, the mission at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "groundless and unsubstantiated allegations" against certain members of the Security Committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said it wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solutions.
Gates, who had returned to Washington last Friday, he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he flew into the region of Kurdistan, the oil-rich to meet with soldiers in Kirkuku and with Kurdish leaders in Irbilu.
There is still a high tension between Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, mainly because of the border, a proprietary rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to zabránlo presence of US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to allay concerns about the Kurdish from persistent depression. Official cited by the US space Gates when he told Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomiji in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you. "
In an ageing China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propagandistickými posters that read "Mother Earth" is too exhausted to fund more children "and" One Kind, moreover, is a grave, ".
He learned a lesson that if an official government position in Shanghai, alarmována low birth rate and ageing population in their city, abruptly changed course in this summer, and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always spend all their time and energy is just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31-year-old human resources manager, who has a son 8měsíčního.
For more than 30 years of policy in China have only one child was introduced, and thereby created only two generations of the notoriously fuller and zhýčkaných children afektovaně or ” Little Emperors "threatens the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six than vpolitika vsoupila, according to data from the United Nations.
The distribution of the population, where the number of residents aged 60 and above, predicts that the 12-year-old will grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. That's far above the average of around 20 percent.
An imbalance is more affluent coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people at the age of 60 years of age and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, the director of the Shanghai Population and Family Planning Commission said, many couples have children to "helped to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and a reduction in staff shortages in the future".
He says that it's about "being old, that doesn't mean to be rich — as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden."
Comforting the gradual
How was it embedded in the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to remain the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, which violated the policy, has faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official places are advocating policies that helped the country avoid critical of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned to enforce the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men against women.
In past years, population, officials were progressively milder in his opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule, letting go výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which a man and woman were only children -- and, in 2007, the most refined their passwords, leveraging the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing Institute of population research universities, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, the Šanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more at.
Almost overnight we had posters, make parents to have only one child, and replaced with a copy of all the regulation, describing in detail how he would have been entitled to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers, so that they can meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under doors.
Also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The response was cool, according to officials for planning families.
Response Zarmucující
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai recorded an increase in interest for couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts reported any changes.
With a population of urban district Huinan 115000, for example, still registered a four to five times a month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the number of campaign was born in the town in 2010 was still expected to be only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in Shanghai čtvti Caolu noted that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children and they are legally allowed to be.
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Dociální without a safety net could be the choice of irresponsible.
People in the west on a one-child policy is wrong as a matter of legal question, says Yang, a structural engineer, whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child.
Yes, we have been deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
The money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for the hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says that they're asking for only one child, because she also was an only child: "We were the focus of our families and everyone was cared about us.
We were not used for the provision of care, and in fact we wouldn ’ t worry about the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who have their own translation company, put it much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové middle-class parents who have lower birth rates, said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30letí waxing consult on their parents as in the first days číského probíjející experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of živita for myself, he says.
Just one child has placed enormous demands on the parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of my social life.
Then there are more contentious issues propstoru -- "You must rebuild your home" -- and strategy -- "You must have a summary prepared by the time a child reaches 9 months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends wants to be content with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many victims.
Group of the United Nations outlined a plan to cut emissions.
The UN sponsored conference on climate change -- with a large neukázněnými position and mutual osočováním -- is once again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious cuts in the amount of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, bearing most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text, which may provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, as well as the remaining barriers to illuminate the path forward.
But it was to see important progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time, with more than 100 world leaders who are coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN Working Group on an ad hoc basis, this story casually stated how much money rich countries should provide the poor countries to tackle global warming in the short-term and long-term.
And it provides a wide variety of choices for key questions, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit global temperature increase by policy makers are still able to tolerate.
This process dodábá a large amount of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the top official in Washington, the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested šestistránkový document zestručnění from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on the issue at the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
The outlines of a possible settlement, in which he could be jointly industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period for 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union on Friday to discuss his promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change -- from cope with floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still, but on Friday said the same sort of verbal fireworks that prevailed at the talks in the past week.
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with dobrovolností among the major emerging economies, as would not be financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration established the harder line against China on Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accept a contract without a transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of the action, said Stern, who also said that the text is not sufficient to ensure constraint and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US main negotiators on climate issues that either a lack of "a little common sense," or "exceptional irresponsibility" lead earlier in the week to the statement that the United States would help either financially in China, to be able to deal with global warming.
With the future of economic trajectory of the world ’ s major powers at stake, both arguments have erupted in the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is mostly on the conservation of individual countries, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the performance of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point to the fact that two of the most powerful countries in the world ignores scientific imperative for the implementation of the recommended more forceful actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate Costa Rica, he said, it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of omezováníí greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in seeking Order to prevent major issuers responsibly in their actions.
It's obviously a game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné impacts of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants, said that the best outcome of talks will be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has a 43 members created a draft agreement 24stránkový last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations, "has caused a political tlkak polirtický on the whole process," partly because they are now united action and demand from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations resulted in a new urgency as the delegates focusing on the fact that the majority of the remaining issues must be resolved before the heads of governments compete on the deal.
High-ranking officials, for example, India ’ s environment minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and the attackers halls Bella Center at a closed door meetings and conferences so that they can chart a new claims, which will be considered next week.
Total rozsáhlost Assembly - which 13,000 people on a daily basis přemisťovalo to and from the convention center, on guitar playing activists inscenovali ironizující spectacle of countries in the middle of the night on which they put them forward, and on the transmission of proposals from hand to hand on the paper rather than e-mail -- controlled by the challenge.
The effort is only the extension: In Copenhagen were present at nearly all of the key ministers and earlier in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We made it to the top category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for global policy at the international nature conservation.
Come heavy-weight.
Britain's first train with a speed of 140 mph předefinoval this Monday feelings
At 5: 13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which revolutionized transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country has reached a speed of 140 mph and fly from Ashfordu in Kent to St, London and St overcomes distance 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, is then joined Mrs Kelly Holmesové and joined the first high-speed passenger trains outside lLndýn.
Hopes that the new service, where appropriate, joins Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and joins a great urban agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
Disregarded stagnant water should reduce transport times in passenger traffic and on business trips and the transition from planes and cars on the railroad could reduce carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties to get for this vision.
But dozens of bilinů pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the deterioration of the environment now přibrzdily building the British high-speed lines.
The High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide a credible government study submitted its report to Lord Adonisovi 30 December, the Times reported.
He gave a detailed map of the route of the next stage of the planned High Speed Network.
The new trace links London with the western Midlandem was designed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where he would be on the propstředí dopat could be problematic.
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final routes.
HS2 is also expected to identify three options for extensive high-speed network, leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
Preferred choice is konfikurace Y-shaped curve, with one high-speed track should lead to the West Midland.
The track should be split up near Birmingham, one of the branches, passing from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the second, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems there has been the most effective choice," he said, and a judge of the railways.
Once that is done, journey times between London and Edinburkem shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before the year 2025, it could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should enable trains to travel at a speed of 2 250 miles per hour, which would have made of the British network, the fastest in Europe.
The initial route has already been proposed to hold the trains in the length of the 400 metres, which would have been capable of carrying 100 passengers.
To 18 trains would operate every hour on the line of the London-Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve the needs of up to 20 000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, it is expected that the existing stations would be extended so that pojmula high-speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San St International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether is or is not going to implement this scheme, but an extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that keč a final decision will not be forthcoming before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should build in instalments.
Trains should be first placed into service, not on the high-speed lines, but the existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
It is seen as a crucial points of contact for the transition between the aircraft on trains, reference point for the revolution on the railroad.
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of $75,000 pounds on oranžérii Toryů
Alan Duncan, the holder of the chair-front benches in the House of Commons Toryů taxpayers paid thousands of pounds in expenses last year at oranžerii, which built up in his home in the electoral district.
A spokesman for the prison, who was demoted David Cameronem, complained that MPs were living "on rations", has increased its mortgage on a £75,000 to build an extension of the oak sandwiched in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, the overall hundreds of pounds a month tax payers.
Village authorities have approved claims in a timely manner and that has not been questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who performed the control of the Member výdajlů. Last night, Mr Duncan said his requirements "menohlo be cleaner and simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, its own two-storey houses in the village in its electoral district Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about a million pounds.
It is on the ground floor kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office wasn't agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added to the winter garden, which is in the plans marked as "oranžerie".
Neighbors described her as "greenhouse for fun and entertainment".
Mr Duncan was asked to provide an explanation for the increase in lending during the last inspection committee for municipal standards and privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The committee he disclosed last month that he broke the rules, after an examination of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed pupilární guarantee on mortgages amounting to £271406 from his property in London at the house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
RBS mortgage interest repayments of Mr Duncan was unable to change at this time, suggesting that it was intended to finance the loans of $75,000 pounds.
Standard variable mortgage repayments RBS declined in December 2007 of 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with the left.
The final document of the municipal offices, shows that Mr Duncan said of claiming £1,250 per month in May of this year.

A lawyer for the Polish-French director Roman Polanski re-applied on Thursday in the Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to suspend the prosecution against his client, who is currently in a Swiss residence because of the moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "pianist" criticized the three judges of the revocation of the second district court in California, serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the event in 1977.
I demand to prosecute here and now, said lawyer Hummel said, adding that the behavior of a judge who had ruled on the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a chill through".
According to him, was no longer among the judges (who died) before the utterance of the judgment was alleged to deal with the state's attorney, who told him that Roman Polanski deserves to go to prison – which is a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, search and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But, in the end, Mr. Wells said at the end of September, that "lied" to the author of the document.

Prosecutor repeated what has already been said at the time of the first state, namely, that there will be no serioznímu study the request to halt the prosecution until the Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
Year-old 76ti director fled the United States in 1978, before the court delivered its judgment in Case "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a teenage girl at the age of 13 years.
Since then, never again set foot in the territory of the United States.
The assistant district attorney in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayamová, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
In this case, we want to give not just pieces of Polaski, but also other employee that it is possible to run? He asks Ms Asayamová.

One of the three judges who now have 90 days to accept the decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
HUMMEL's lawyer was not alone in asking for the suspension of criminal prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The legal representative of the victim, Samantha Geimerové also asked for the termination of a criminal prosecution.
She reminded that her client had continued to face this eternal harassment whenever the Polanski case emerged, and added: "Nobody in this room is unable to say that the process was fair."

Authorities UDF increases the tone and calls on the side of the Nouveau Centre, in order to keep their nepožívala shortcut.
Authorities UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, Friday in response to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervého Morina on the appropriation of abbreviations former Giscardovy parties, with the result that the shortcut may not be used in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced their intention to claim a shortcut UDF with François Bayrou could not bear its heritage, after the left hand.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned this strategy firm on the Saturday before the National Council of Resistance Nouveau Centre (NC).
The move he has gained the support of the Member Hervého de Charetta (ex-for-UMP now for NC), who attributes the ownership of brands UDF because it was the first drop in 2004 to register in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l ’ Institut de la industrial property).
But on Friday evening, a committee of the Association of UDF directed friends François Bayrou, who do not have any intention to expropriate, got out of his silence and filed a formal request from the Minister and MPs to stop using the shortcut and handed back the ownership of the trade mark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In the past few days have raised alarming statement that suggest his own political movement + + to retake the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 to 24 members of the committee, of which, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the modem or Sen. Jean Arthuis centriste from the Alliance.
At the same time, you are considered a suitable place in their promotional materials, and on the website of the name of your movement + Nouveau centre +, with the slogan + UDF today +, state also signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this explains the UDF that asks the NC "immediately removed all references the names of the UDF from all promotional materials, including (their) website".
At the same time, asks Hervého de Charettea "to hand ownership of the trade mark the legitimate owners".
If not, we will turn to the courts, in order to take account of the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, point signatories.
In his letter stated that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978" and point out that Mr Morin and his friends "elected" retirement in 2007, "in order to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002, founded the UMP.
Nouveau movement centre has, therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la democracy française).
At the same time, they point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect to a modem for three years, and for the creation of a committee charged with defending "moral and material interests" association based Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervého de Charettea continues with the committee, "when the registered trademark", not "for three years, a member of the UDF", but the UMP.
Skandálním and fraudulently used the non-existent registration akronyma to do so on its own account.
This netaktnost starts to be turned into a criminal act, they contend, and then with irony expressed on a strategy of NC: "It seems to us that, as in politics, as in life is more valuable to make a name for himself, rather than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent by names that don't have the right".
The case Liliane Bettencourtové: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of state weakness.
A court in Nanterre, on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Baniera and the judge whether he used state weakness osmdesátileté miliardářky to prepare it for a part of its capital, of which it accuses her daughter Liliane Bettencourtová.
A photographer (62), known for his photographs of famous will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is an offence for which a sentence in a maximum of 3 years and a fine of $375 000 euros.
This Decision confirms that the actual process will take place in extreme cases, that can be described as a family saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which a mother and daughter challenge each other and fighting for control of L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, 15 criminal court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliany Bettencourtové, which should make the College of three doctors.
A scion of the company's main akcionářka L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, at least not on the terms offered by prosecutors in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report on 10 March 2010, and at the same time submit an expression that Liliana Bettencourtová could be in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think it would undergo.
I talk to her about the matter, said after the hearing Miss Bettencourtové lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As for the lawyer Francois Bettencourtové-Meyersové, Olivier Metznera, welcomed the court's decision.
This is great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady, who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
Two years ago, the only daughter Liliany Bettencourtové launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, whom they blame for years to take advantage of the weakness of her mother, in order to obtain the gifts of one billion euros in the form of a cheque, contracts for life insurance, or paintings by masters.
But Liliane Bettencourtová always refused to accept that it would be a photographer, who is regarded as a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court has had to consider the legality of the suit filed by Ms. Bettencourtovou-Meyers, Friday's judicial speech lawyers are sometimes changed during the family hour of truth.
The attorney Liliany Bettencourtové submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which she expressed distrust for her husband Françoisy Bettencourtové-Meyersové.
In a letter from 2003, according to an attorney Liliane Bettencourtová adds: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote Banierovi over a period of 15 years, once to twice a day.
Ever since they got married, I'm with François could never speak ".
Again, the prosecutor in Nanterre found that negotiations stěžovatelky is not justified, for that reason that, in these days of a mother hen, a judge rejected her request for the initiation of a proceeding to the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourtová "is fully prepared to participate in the trial, under the protection is not in custody.
No one else will not act for her, "confirmed the choice for the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
The court eventually ruled that the justification for Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of the opening of the process.
Managerial revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If things don't change in the management of big French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than a decade, is reminiscent of the behaviour of the managers of large firms with employees access business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: The point is that the associates identified them as having a "values" identified from the mountain, as was the case in the past, when it was necessary to impose the consumer products derived from ideas of heads of factory technicians.
The fact that the customer has become a hub of entrepreneurial companies, compared the marketing strategy of conquest of the market in the right direction — even if the authoritarian tendencies of the force products different from consumer preferences are regularly.
Passive approach employees can lead to fatal demoralizaci.
Firms suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only visible parts of much rozšířenějšího general phenomenon, which will fall mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilisation adversely affects the development of all mental functions of the company, including research and development, and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
And, indeed, EI "requires all interested parties (...) and the ability to predict an active approach" and demands from the staff of the obligations that are inconsistent with the incomes of the authoritarian management.
Therefore, we urge the managerial revolution, which should aim to include workers at the center of the interests of the company as well as a client.
Relative the usefulness of internal polls.
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I fear that does not.
Mainly because I was convinced himself that, in the face of the new situation, the structure on various occasions returns as a matter of priority... what it has always done!
Furthermore, because the authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, shall be increased proportionately with the gravity of their own failures.
Finally, as the majority of managers has a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are university graduates for engineers, have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of convenience take old behavioristickou theory currently again highlighted "neurovědami" from the US and widely operated without too much knowledge of the scientific institutes and other media.
It is possible to move "levers" (SIC) the involvement of managers, indicated in a recent survey of the Agency Ipsos Figaro.fr on Web pages, which only strengthens the case management workers in their position of mechanical management, unfit for today ’ s world.
To identify and measure the factors mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of the modern business, provides for the adoption of definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight of all projects and practice management: For the employee of the firm commitments will be possible only if they will seem like a simple means to achieve their dreams and ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation of staff address only functional analysis of the study as an incentive.
These studies have shown that evaluates their businesses on the basis of pre-determined doxy, which will allow them through the image, which the company says, assess what offers them to achieve their goals in life.
Thanks to identify and measure of these factors can mobilize managers to monitor, forecast and pre-empted in its "social performance" and list its management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of fair and effective economic intelligence.
Sign of the Oslo Accords: "A just war" Obama had praised by the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009, defended the concept of the "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who have taunted Obama at a price of 9 October, this time a presidential speech clapping, including Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice-president in an election in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a Republican muse of the right-wing for USA Today, and added that she herself on this subject "might be necessary" war expressed in his memoirs, which are in the process.
The war, of course, is the last thing that the Americans would like to have a job, but it is needed.
There is a need to stop the terrorists, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush Thursday in Oslo, defending the deployment of forces, and used the speech to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama ’ s opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president did in Oslo, "a very good job".
I think that the speech was very good, and a former chairman of the House of Representatives, which particularly appreciate the president's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I felt that the speech was historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
Former Rep., whom many regard as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential election in 2012, was delighted to see "leftist president," recalled to the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, "that they would not be free and can transmit the Peace Prize, if there is no use of force".
According to Michael Gerson, a former author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made "very American speech".
Not only has himself as a "citizen of the world" as well as ever, but "sounded like the American president," and said Europeans "that they live in a bubble, which was created for themselves, and that they don't do too much for it to be preserved," said Gerson's been taking credit for.
Among the handful of discontent among the ranks of the Bush-era hawk, former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who described the speech as "humdrum, pompous and without the inspiration," he said on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, a favorite Democrat Dennis Kucinich is horrified by the sight of Barack Obama, justifies the use of force.
"When the war packed into the package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people", he warned.
However, the medium-leftist press against President takes a favourable opinion.
Though the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the peace prize for early for Obama, said his output as a "nadvýkon", despite the fact that the speaker is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide for the international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression "rendition places a California newspaper.
Obama "keynote speech what had to be done," said the New York Times, and a sign marked "for the simple and instructive".
Road hauliers: Three marathons to the agreement, which will save the delivery of inventory at Christmas.
After three procedural maratónech unions ran out of road hauliers and TLF, only employers ’ organisations, who remained until the end, Friday night to the Agreement, which ended the call to strike, and the threat that hung over the supply of inventory at Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau at Friday's signing of the Agreement expressed "joy" and that after some negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions with negotiators on Friday morning soon broke up, in the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three of the employers' organisation (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) from the negotiations have each withdrawn.
But it was the need for more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. to make a deal, and in 18 hours podepsaliznění Agreement.
This conflict "would be very hurt businesses" and "there would be a risk that they will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text of the text includes wage increases of 4% for the lowest wages (for local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for those with the highest salaries (international transport).
Hourly wages in the lowest salary increases from 8,72 euros to yield 9.06.
It's not much, but it is behind a lot of effort, said Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we'll give our members in order to avoid blockades, no blockages supply centres.
But it can occur for a few opponents, who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was hard to admit to an increase in salaries relative to the international competition ".
According to him, an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and about 100 to 120 euros at the top.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (the CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT) is a "reasonable compromise".
The agreement also involves revalorizaci travel expenses of $3% and a report on the situation of the state of the road in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
Bussereau said "a reduction of 100 million euros in taxes on wages undertakings," which has been the subject of an amendment to the bill on the government's budget for 2009, which participated in the night from Thursday to Friday's National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to "identical" vote.
The signature enables that this agreement will apply as soon as possible to the companies that are members of the organization, later on the field, in the case of the extension of the Ministry of Labour.
They shall take place "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
The whole process can only impede the opposition of employers' organisations.
Enterprise FNTR speaks of "bad market" for 100 million "sector has already been offered in the context of the compensation part of a carbon tax".
Secretary of State for Transport forced us to emergency negotiations, not as a result of the analysis, but the Super nerozhněval jedlíky turkeys at the time of the Christmas holiday, she complained Unostra.
For your organization Otre threatens to an agreement over the next 12 months, "to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the scope".
RER commuter trains A: Abortion services over the weekend, the union with some proposals for a transport firm RATP.
Abortion services on the line of suburban RER trains A, which is the largest line of the city's public transport in France, will continue over the weekend because Friday's meeting between unions and management of RATP on the second day of the strike to yield concrete results in otázcežádosti on the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, then held on for an important shopping weekends before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 and 20 hour, on the main stage (between La Défence and Nation) will run every second train outside of this section of the train was only one of the four.
Links with the SNCF will disconnect in Nanterre Préfecture, so that passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Trading houses Galeries Lafayette, which expects every day over 200,000 customers welcomed the fact that "the RATP tried zajištěníspojení with big business houses".
Line the RER A results from west to east of the Parisian conurbation.
The managed RATP leads of Saint-Germain-en-Lay and in Nanterre Boissy-Saint-grass and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, he was at the top of the train in the operation of one of the two, and virtually no didn't during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of the Ile de France managed differently at landings and confusion reigned.
So early in the morning was at the centre of Saint-Germain-en-Lay (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia, also because devoid of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years of Boissy-Saint-grass (Val-de-Marne) explained that he stood for "about an hour and a half early, to make sure they arrive in a timely manner".
The station of Saint-Lazarus was not overcrowded, announced the state railway SNCF predicted a larger number of ushers and security guards.
The RER commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction of A or Cergy model-Le-Haut came or departed from the station, Saint-Lazarus with přípojem on the subway.
For the General Assembly strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with management and unions that are rated as "weak".
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER trains and in all respects, the organization of working time, the course of his career, etc.
However, this is the drivers who are demanding the bonus, according to Thierry Garona (OdboryJih).
In the meantime, RATP even extended proposals on bonuses, which hurt the CGT, with the result that the leadership "was not able to solve the problem, while roaming carriers and SNCF about it".
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer to review the terms of the occupation," said RATP transport undertakings.
That is the reason why the union believes that the company "is from a weekend of fun".
In the morning hours, about 150 drivers with corporate Committee at its Paris headquarters.
Management, which had so far refused to any discussion during the strike, therefore, in the interests of the "comfort" by opting for a meeting.
There is a danger that the conflict on Tuesday, will be extended to the RER B line, after the Unsa Indepedents and notify stávkovou emergency.
The unions are asking for a premium of $120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, the CFDT, Sud (South), indépendants (Indepedents)) and make it difficult to get used to the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
Driver of suburban RER trains earn at a more advanced stage career 2200-2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros premium for an irregular hours of work and working on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish justice dismissed for the Kurdish side and this decision carries heavy consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to repeal of the main pro-Kurdish parties in the country. This decision immediately provoked protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country, and in Istanbul.
This Decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to bring the Kurdish community in a friendly hand to attempt to end the 25-year conflict.
For the Democratic Party (DTP), the company was disbanded because it has become a "nest of activities against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he told journalists, the chairman of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by the 11 judges, when it was needed for the dissolution of the majority-seven votes, said Kiliç and added that 37 of party cadres, including its president Ahmeta Türka Aysely Tuglukové and the ban to participate in the political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the cancellation of parliamentary immunity, which used by Mr and Mrs Tugluková Türk, and the seizure of the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (500).
The administration has already warned any crimes you need to be solved that Members of Parliament leaves rather than if he served as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the process launched in 2007, the chief justice of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahmanem Yalcinkayem, who accused the DTP of obedience to "commands" Party of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political display of the rebels from the PKK.
Page states that he is not with the PKK no "fundamental link", but refuses to label it a terrorist organization, and calls on the government to be negotiating with her.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community in a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and attempting to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP officials confirmed that disbanding the parties could lead to renewed tension in the southeastern Anatolia, where in the past few weeks on a life of its own many demonstrations against the conditions under which detained PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with the police.
From the notification of the decision of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the seat of the DTP in Diyarbakiru, a big city in the southeast, which is occupied by mostly Kurds.
The police used the normalization era and water cannon, the protesters threw again Molotovovy cocktails or shooting stones from the slings.
Also in Istanbul demonstrated about a hundred people.
After the verdict, Mr Türk stated that the decision of the justice is "deepening despair".
Turkey is unable to this question (Kurds to resolve the ban, he said in a press release.
The government, formed by the side of the identity of the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are from the principle against interference of the parties.
It does not solve anything, said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz.
This Decision is an utter [Democratic proposals, which was initiated by the government, said political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, you can wait to see the reaction of the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK alluded to one of the nejvražednějších attacks in the north of Turkey that killed three days earlier, seven soldiers.
The new Silicon-Valley
Many years passed as a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was a closely guarded location, where they performed a secret weapons research.
Today, it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 miles from Moscow Center, "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelektronická research and manufacturing centre.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with representatives of Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and firms frankfurtského Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There has been a series of mutual visits and on Wednesday signed in Frankfurt and Zelenograd Ridberg "the Protocol on close co-operation".
The Russian delegation was led Moscow Yuri vícestarosta Rosljak and the prefect of Anatoly Zelenogradu Smirnov in Frankfurt foot the head clerk planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they'll go representatives FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research on one seminar in Zelenogradu.
Of the scientific
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZu companies will be allowed to grip the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, the Russian scientific firms want to get a contract in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of the Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the need for the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, large groups and Sitronics Rossijskaja electronics.
District was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" Armament Research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of the "Green City") acquired its name in the wooded hilly landscape in which they are given a research facility.
Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 can't adequately prepared.
For fans of the project, it is quite simply the "new" Europe ".
Okay. S21 is more than a running train station, more than a monstrous building, which would throw the capital city of Baden-Württemberg Landtag per decade in a desperate civil chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Hlavové station with the rails, which ended in the centre of town, was then considered to be a reach-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it had to be enormously much time on přepřáhnutí locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive, a second, go on - this is the way it should work.
And that is disappearing hlavová station: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: Transit station, which is located roughly in the middle of trans-European rail route between Paris and highway through / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 1980s is no longer compatible with reality.
They are very ambitious developers recognized that in a big city bavorském hesenském is the start of construction of the nearly neufinancovatelné.
Since there is a modern shuttle trains in motor vehicles and managing at both ends, they don't have any problems with the train station hlavová zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Yet: Starting with Stuttgart 21, including a new route to ICE Ulmu.
Enforce that surface and local politicians.
Track shall cooperate, because of the risk of an individual's biggest infrastructure project in the Czech Republic will be borne by the taxpayer and no public concern.
Still the project may be in some kind of apology.
There will be a new urban space, which - if we're to believe the computer images of the planners - will include many green.
For rail transport system is S21 harmful.
Clearance of the station, and the construction of the line are intended for passenger services, which are typically - in the 1980s - attributed the huge increase.
Then, there was no competition from low-cost flights.
Modern transport policy has to go but primarily for the strengthening of freight transport, because the rail transport is more environmentally friendly than the freight car on the road.
But a new line is not due to a sharp rise suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
In the Švábsku should bury good six billion euros.
It is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that the next decade will miss the finances for the next hub points and narrow space on the network.
In the list of the Department of Transportation's sixty larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180-mile-long route of the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, on this route puts the slow pace.
There would be a need for a push.
But S21 will be as a brake.
The track of the Rhine valley will become the neck of the bottle of international freight transport: Directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is studying the judgment on the airport
The government has been left in the open land Wiesbadenském, if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice (VGH Hessian administrative) regarding the ban on night flights and allow him to reconsider.
A coalition of the CDU / FDP commissioned experts to legally consider more than 400stránkový judgment VGH, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
Writing in Kassel VGH today to make the case that it would have to happen in the case of the planned construction of the north-west of the airport runway frankfurtského newly edited a ban on flights.
The authorisation 17 flights between 23 and 5 minutes ago, as envisaged in the Earth's government does not comply with the statutory protection of the population against the night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4, whether it will require a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticised the delay and insisted on a government representative to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The boss of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel challenged the CDU and FDP that returning to the promises about the ban on night flights, which began before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to rate as a "violation of the words".
It is a difficult, if you can keep his word, "said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir that alluded to the election slogan FDP" My Word holding ".
The minister rejected impeachment Posch Schäfer-Gümbela, the government tries through "distortions of law and tricks" to get to their dressing flights.
The precise legal control needs their time.
The coalition wants to work on the basis of "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Mueller (FDP).
Comments by his faction of the ban on night flights were never such as it gives the Opposition.

The choice quick
It was a faster than expected.
Station introduced in place of a mere two weeks after the Board ZDF out of the office of the editor in chief Nikolause Brendera.
Last night, the panel wanted to agree on that person.
He was known as the favourite Peter Frey, who led the study of ZDF in the capital city in Berlin.
Station, but it has not been proven - officially to nepředbíhala process.
But it could also play a role that would damage the quartermaster ZDF Markus Schächtera if this proposal for the board failed.
Frey, Schächterův, the candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The result of the vote was not known before the close of this issue.
Two weeks ago, stranded in the Administrative Board Schächter with its proposal to extend the engineers Nikolaus Brenderem contract for another five years.
For Brendera participated only seven members, seven were against him. Brenderova mandate, the loss was a bitter defeat for Schächtera, although it is to be expected.
Most of the EU in the Administrative Board had already flagged for a couple of weeks before the election that he would not want in office to confirm Brendera.
Resistance to the editor organized hesenský Premier Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in office highly esteemed editor in chief, arguing that the Brendera declined the quota-tracking news broadcasters ZDF.
Until shortly before the election because of the protests, in which he harshly criticized the political influence on ZDF.
The last time in the debate vmísilo even 35 státoprávních lawyers who Kochův process heralded as unconstitutional.
It wasn't good.
On the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingenu.
He studied politics, education and romanistiku.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, he crossed Frey ZDF, first to "heute-automation journal".
Next stop: 1988 to 1990 personnel clerk, editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; in 1998, the head of a moderator "Morgenmagazins"; in 2001, the head of foreign policy ZDF; since then, the head of a major studio ZDF.
After she was Brender, which was at the centre of the elected expert periodikem Medium magazin journalist of the year, Green announced that it will report a constitutional complaint.
Kochův opponent in the Administrative Board, rýnsko-falcký Prime Minister, Kurt Beck, said last week that the Land would change the state's contract with ZDF so that the staff of the quartermaster proposals could not be blocked a politically motivated mostly.
Beck but also refused to rule out of party politicians from the advisory boards ZDF.
Brenderův presumed successor, Peter Frey, the Administrative Board ordered a chess shrewd move - immediately after the toppling Brendera panel criticized heavily for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence would be nominated for the post of editor without losing face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Administrative Board, without coming into the suspicion that he was straník protlačen into office.
In the party ’ s arithmetic Frey is already classified for leftist liberals.
The study of the junk
A partial success for students: After a year to strike finally reached on Thursday in several other countries, the ministers of culture: At the conference of ministers of culture and the university presidents, both sides agreed on the grounds that it will improve conditions for a bachelor's degree and a Masters in Engineering from.
In the future, students should be able to handle their studies.
In particular, they agreed that it reduces the burden on the tests: The principle should be every study module end with one single test.
In addition, it should be retested workload of learners, and it should ensure "fair and obhajitelná rate".
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition tests between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal Land undertake to create a more flexible common structural award for the undergraduate and graduate degree courses.
The Earth derogations should cease to exist.
The less tests
From the start of the student protests in the worm had ministers of culture and the university rektoři winged words in the mouth of a studio.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests, in part, to drastically reduce: "Each module will usually end once the test," writes in a 30-page report, which is due, in part, to re-regulate the approval of academic disciplines.
"Significantly lower zkouškovou burden," said the chairman of the accreditation council Reinhold Grimm, is to be "stopped bad development that significantly limited the performance of the studio."
To be "performance of the studio" in the future, "the decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules, as well as the contents of the "must be hard to check" to "unnecessarily restrict student in the selection
Seminars ".
Students should "be entitled to the space, which allows and encourages its own initiative".
The rules are to apply for approval of the new subjects, after a review, but also for the current academic disciplines.
You need to be "přeakreditovat" every five years – which means, however, that will take until 2015 before they are rechecked all fields of study.
He is responsible for all over Germany ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to the accreditation councils established states.
The ministers of culture in October called "strongly" Land that the agency acted so that the material was too large and received the practice mode was not strict.
In the individual Länder are already universities and colleges have agreed with terrestrial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The money should pay for counselling programmes in high school and study advice, and to strengthen the test and foreign offices.
They want for this country, and universities to spend ten million euros.
At the start of 2010, he wants to pass the bill to parliament vládat higher law.
It would be for the completion of the study of the module should be necessary only a single test.
Design studios should be more flexible, it should be granted recognition tests from other universities and the aftermath of the disclosure of the master's degree.
By the end of next year should be inspected to dedicate all subjects in the country.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again indulged about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise a critique of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Directors Juso university groups called for the creation of education policy neodehrávala in the future, "behind closed doors" of ministers and university presidents.
The latest strike would "go should talk, at least, the word" as well as the students of the person concerned.
The future scholars also gained support from the president of the Conference of university presidents (HRK), Margrety Wintermantelové: "We need the experience of students," said Thursday in a meeting with the ministers of culture, HRK advised on the common reform message.
In accordance with the departments of Education and Science (GEW Bonn resolution) did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would have Absolventovi s bakalářským nástavbové title to allow access to the branch.
Second, the Land must ensure that for this generation of students graduate qualifications was tomorrow have enough seats in the Masters majors with what the best conditions of the study, said in a Member of the Board of Directors GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal countries must employ more speakers.
Culture ministers, however, have free access to the Masters Degrees suit.
More than a footnote to Hertě Müllerové
To get into and out of Germany's nice, almost no control... "is the opening line of a poem poet Werner Söllnera, which in this torn piece of language with experience with přicestováním one dissenter, which gained freedom came at the same time, but for their language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 v rumunském Banátu, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, later, as a teacher of one of the children's book-publishing, in 1982, he moved to Frankfurt.
He was honored Söllner different literary awards, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he was the leader of the Hessian fora literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A considerable stir mimoliterární care last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which were a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a broken mirror of its security act".
Obviously baffled mind had chafed before Söllner left out of the declaration, which came ahead of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including "Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuthem Frauendorferem, admits to working as an undercover informant for Romania's Securitate secret service.
Together with some of those present gained Söllner in 1989 German language prize.
Attempts were being conscripted said quietly, first in 1971.
I continued Söllner, "meaning someone who wouldn't sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize Hertě Müllerové and its bezpříkladným literary dealing with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken case that indicates the depths and appalling political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is, at least if it can be said, according to the current state of knowledge, as an offender, but is also a victim.
In the acts Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllnerově met Michael, good-by and referred to a positive influence on his own secret agent Walter.
"Cutting" me in all of the important points for him, saying good-by.
He has a moral obligation to make this note.
The statement was Söllnerovo in this form, and prior to that audience unexpected, but not totally surprising confession of a former dissident and his co-operation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta M. already wrote in July, when she read their own record, 914 parties that Germany was a pleasant reservations for snoopers Securitate.
The, presumably, they speculate, and, in some cases, I know that the name is hiding behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, has a way of viewing Stazi, is a relic of the handling of inspections of the Securitate very diffuse.
In the last few years has been marred by systematic education and hampered.
One of the Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Board for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate are still in Romania, a big effect, showed after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hertu Müllerovou one conversation in which is one of the former bosses of the Securitate Timisoara expressed an appreciation nositelce dismissively.
He has a psychosis, after all, been vyslýchána only once.
Power potupení here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that the incident Söllner, as in the context of zamlčeným felony, combines the inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was marred? Specific response to return, it leaves the audience Söllnerovo expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than lots are awarded by guilt and shame.
On the origins of art Herty Müllerové, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League saturated
It looked as if he came clean clothes sales representative from a Christmas party for the sporting goods distributed sweets, getting a quarter of an hour after midnight on C-class Mercedes out a new coach VfBr Christian Gross, followed by orange-colored bag sponsor. ¨
The man with the marked bald spot for him after he had left the ship in a foreign city.
Otherwise, they could drive alone - the alcohol wasn't in the game, and a drunk man 55letý happiness was too low.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue in the job.
Or is it just started.
In the words of only three days of committed Swiss messenger: "We have reached osmifinále", namely in the Champions League thanks to výhře3: 1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we mustn't get dazzled success: It will be brutally tough fighting's descent left."
"Far more important task," he stands on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the exercise of royal class in Mainz, even in ordinary ligovém date.
And to prevent the recurrence of an apparent groin after three quick gólech Maricy (5.), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Draw lots
Osmifinále Champions League match (16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / the return match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will draw lots of 18 December in Nyon.
Taking the joy of třeskavého Babbelova successor will thus remain unchanged.
Not only for the alleged Healer, which uncertain stuttgartským professionals added confidence in a short period of time, the willingness to the use and enjoyment of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on your strengths and urging them to be bolder, explained the healer souls Gross so simple-sounding successful recipe that but for the presence of a therapist Babbela but no longer had any effect.
Spurred on a certain magic, he admitted Babbelův follower Jens Lehmann, "when it comes to new impetus in football, they are sometimes things that you would think of themselves as possible."
Sami Khedira and, after weeks of break due to injury, has become, thanks to its dynamism as the best player on the court, he tried to describe the "phenomenon" příslovečným "fresh wind" and working procedures for the new manager: "He's a man who is a radical and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
For the Babbela apparently missed.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns the President Horst Heldt sports
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
They won't even as top players and managers overestimate the victory against a weakened auto parts and totally overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
I would have won in Glasgow, then came an ugly awakening after the defeat of 0-4 in Leverkusenu, consider Khedira.
The President Horst Heldt sports and reminded that he has one goal of the season, the other, but it is still a long way off.
We're not out of the woods.
He on his 40th birthday celebrated Heldt even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to víkendovými events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with the backup goalie Jensem Lehmannem just before the start of the game.
The decision, which makes the others; and not Jens, said Heldt on hard Lehmannovu criticism.
The executive board had advanced weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure pubertálních fans.
That was canceled his day off after the match, Lehmann marked as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.
Remarks Lehmannovy "mouthing clean egoism," said Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalie.
Both in their 40s will not have probably no joy of life.
In any case, you are the one with the other, that without work sesazeného trenérského hráčsky team would not be so strong and rampant performance.
Babbel and his assistants were "a big share of the success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

Case Kundúz
Frontal attack from opposition: The head of the fraction of the Greens Jürgen Trittin marked because of bad information about the affair Kundúz Defense Minister Guttenberga as a liar.
The SPD and the Linke (Levice) Chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of the raid on the opposition Kundúz believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed outright deception.
The minister to a lethal bombing of two tanks in September said "deliberate way", said the chief of the fraction of the Greens Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's news agenda ARD "Tagesschau".
Call it the regular expression: He lied.
The order to kill was published in breach of the rules of contributors to forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report, which was to NATO, which read Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became clear that at the time of the attack, not only on the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
In the U.S. raid that claimed the German commander Kundúzu Colonel Klein, an investigation by NATO to kill or wound up to 142 people.
Green, the SPD and the Linke challenge on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) that immediately expressed before the Federal Energy Saving and also clarify what he really knew Guttenberg about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether he's strategy of targeted killings part of the Afghan policy, the council - and, if the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and Intelligence this new strategy approved, have called Jürgen Trittin, and a colleague from the Greens Renate Künastová.
A government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm flatly rejected the criticism.
The Office of the Chancellor has no effect on the deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also rang out loud doubts about the makeup of the Ministry of the background of the release of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhana and the Secretary of State Peter Wicherta.
According to the information, der Spiegel reported both Guttenberga correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the tanker.
There was a Oficielně that they had to deny the existence of the messages of NATO and concealing the Minister of sensitive details.
Both of the top officials, however, said that the Department of Defense alleging even on several reports, among them on a two-page document commanding Colonel Klein, one of the military police report.
"Frankfurter Sonntagszeitung Allgemeiner" report that Wichert, meanwhile, had the request in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that it has not yet received a response.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not express the remarks and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the investigative committee of the council, which will be introduced next Wednesday.
The worlds dreams
Some see the images and voices that other people can see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication blur the boundaries between reality and imagination.
Until that occurs during sleep, everything is all right.
If we're lying down with her eyes closed in a darkened room, we are allowed to surround the images and fantazijními nejdivočejšími delusions.
But who is experiencing an inescapable dream states, she sees and hears things that other people can see and hear, is in the Western world today, mostly for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as an oddball.
But such images and voices are due not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Blame is our imagination: The same into the processes that allow us to design houses, painting pictures or write novels, here and there, care of it to become one of the border between dream and reality with the idea.
The dreams of the altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, at best, we call them a vision in the worst delusions.
Even if the initiator and effect may vary, however, vision mystičky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, estimated that states of delirium, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Delusions or hallucinations arise when the derailment balance neuronálních transmitérů - especially the brain's dopamine, noradrenalin (norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Comprehensive hallucinations and derelict thoughts occur very often in the schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity above it does not have the power
The link between dreams and delusions of philosophers and doctors no longer employed by serious scholar of antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of hallucinatory waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychology, said in 1861 "great similarity ramblings with passengers states" for the Sigmund Freud was a dream even "psychosis, with all the nonsense, deluded, klamáním senses.
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. is amended in comic figure.
His body is a two-dimensional, and brightly colored.
Gravity above it has no power, hovering near the ceiling of the room.
Feels the kick.
Behind the winged cloven figures with blood-red-mouthed, cenící teeth.
Chase him dig into heavy, fiery boots, throwing him to the wall, is feeling the pain throughout the body.
Loud, bad voices are at risk from the walls and on the radio.
I can't stand the voices that swearing and offend.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo-knot them in the loop and consolidate it on a hook in the ceiling.
He scrambles for a speaker and wants a noose around his neck.
Diving..
The loop.
Learn, a chorus of voices shouting trhajíc his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get help!"
Today's Henning T. 40 years, has seen six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first for nearly 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychosis, moreover, there is a manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with my illness, three years was married.
In a psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deep doubts, he says.
All the ghosts are a reality
About one percent of the people will get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is that after a lifetime of the second most commonly treated illnesses.
An acute schizophrenic psychosis can usually distinguish between the inner and outer world into přebuzeného condition, which can lead to weeks, velikostním, vztahovým delusions or delusions of persecution.
It is particularly prevalent hearing voices - the voices that rozkazují, sum up or maintain dialogue.
Neither the optical delusion are not uncommon.
The person is not able to distinguish between the important from the unimportant, the brain can filter spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as the dream of psychosis opens the floodgates of a barrage of ideas and fantasies that originate from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief surgeon general psychiatric Clinic the university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the centre of the stage, it is important směřovaný at him.
At the same time, it is a passive role, becoming, like a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot is actively shape.
Schizophrenics are therefore often threatened, are controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, they are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucinations
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but remains a sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, as a general rule, a well-preserved."
The erratic thoughts and hallucinations are based on the reality of the experience is occurring in the real framework.
Scientists are still in front of the puzzle of why our brain is doing exactly that sort of stuff.
The exceptional conditions for each person can lead to lose in the short-term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develop into a psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but the twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal damage to the brain.
We believe that in the early stages of development of the ageing brain damage neuronálního, for example, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, though, as there is a malfunction neuronálního system, which was in the long years of no further warnings.
The role of the effects of the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences can be instigated psychosis, if it is to her disposition.
Also the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brain tube
Mad is that psychotronici suffers its hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give the money for drugs to get them, he says, a professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If the images we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collects for ten years, the report on halucinacích and deceptions, last year interpreted his findings in a book, "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (the unreal world in your head).
Even hallucinations belongs to a typical accompanying phenomena psychoses, but also to the surprise of many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression also often diseases like migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly halucinuje under certain conditions, and by a healthy person's brain.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, is composed of the contents of the ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; if our brains tube, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can run this state as well as the brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of the stimulus, stress, worry about love or any other exceptional states.
In the most recent studies had reported up to one-third of those surveyed reported at least once in your life experienced an hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in eastern Pomerania Meklenbursku-front and goes to the grammar school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were not the shapes and voices.
At recess, it may be that appeals to her bony with long, dark hair.
If the answer, they look at her classmates with surprise - no one apart from her sees and hears this boy.
This coy girl as stiff a dreamer, but Sarah K.-eater, knows it.
He is on, he sees and hears this boy, just as he heard and saw a girl sitting next to him on the bench.
It may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he has the boy like.
I'm crazy?, asks ever.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
In the middle of the night are rather daunting figure
Often they are delusional burden.
Sitting in the classroom, doesn't track how many teaching, because a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains everything else visibly and audibly on the board of the mathematical equation.
In the middle of the night appearances are rather depressing.
While waiting in a dark room at the temple, which is not often, too late, you often can't tell the difference, if he's awake or asleep, if the paintings, which they see grin, or a girl with bleeding were at the hands and feet are created before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures.
Parents and friends, says nothing about it, they'll think about it, that's crazy.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she went to college and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted on the internet psychologist Kasten, knows exactly that went mad.
The images are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated, or he is removed incentives, it will have a high probability hallucinations, Kasten said.
I believe that the brain then doesn't have a job and care for his own amusement.
Sarah K., an only child, she was a little girl fear of the other children, often played by herself.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man who says he since she thinks is her own father.
Because the acoustic and visual hallucinations are active the same brain regions that process also realistic images and sounds, is for people with disabilities like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between reality and delusions. "Every experience," Kasten says, "is taking place in the brain, there is also the reality shows.
It is also the images that will result in the brain, therefore, appears so realistic. "
The late-night dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of delusion.
A hallucination of healthy people are essentially indistinguishable from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizofrenikům are mentally healthy people will be able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten, therefore, advises her patients to rate hallucinations as an exceptional ability.
The border between dreams and hallucinations
In our world, concentrated too much on the minds is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, the majority patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and the Chief Medical Officer psychotherapy and Psychiatric Clinic Hospital-Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is tough, útrpná illness, but it also provides the positives, creativity - a mirage is also an art of despair.
The so-called Schmidt-Degenhard oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of changed the consciousness of the dream.
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real and can't even re-distinguished from waking.
Oneiroidní state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as hepatitis polyradikulárním patients who experience fully conscious motor paralysis.
If a person is threatened by the loss of the world and themselves, to be continued, the complete inability of movement, will be replaced with a life-threatening the real situation of their own, imagined a world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of the state between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality, it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in the world, the real situation, but zpřítomní into the picture.
Intensive form of aid senses and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation, which allows people to his own ability to shape, change in an instant by a loss of consciousness.
All of this is real, and later in memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Replacement Heart) as a rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after the operation with subsequent heart valves of the heart transplant was his awareness for several days of travel, with his body lay motionless in intensive care.
Claussen plunged into a world that had formed at a time and place: It is becoming an old man upoutaným on the bed, in the train the sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the aristocracy, which manufactures narcotic substances in the blood.
Greek kidnaps him on the bike to his homeland, in a hospital bed in the Alps or surfing on firnu meets the Korean mobster.
Completely immersed in an imaginary wrong, everything is fair, and later in memory.
These internal roads for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different situation, describes his experience.
In contrast to the dreams are memories of the mental pathways across the years and about minor details plainly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of the experience he smashes the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also waking up our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to distortion of what we call reality."
But the fact that may also be enriching.

J. Burda
At the age of 27 is intended to take over the publisher's children
The new head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: The long-term wants to Hubert Burda forward his business into the hands of his two children, der Spiegel said.
In the future, Holding has also include 100 with the family.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term, in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 years old and have a firm will join the firm, says the man 69letý der Spiegel.
The details are to be handled carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, will be taken later.
And the question of whether to have the ability.
It is not possible to take the lead 7,500 employees their children, if they are not sufficient to the task.
It will kill as children, so the company.
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the presidency of the Board of Directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen's niece.
The 52-year-old Kallen's since 1999, Member of the Board of Directors for Burdy.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, in the section Checkout added the responsibility for the company's assets and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera also Direct Marketing, while Press and Finance.
For the first time in publishing, none of the members of the family.
Burdovým children's 19 and 17 years, his son, Felix, which now has 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen's niece also serves to "bridged the 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should in future include 100 with the family, says Burda.
Having regard to the cases and Schickedanz Schaeffler, Burda said that neither family businesses do not have confidence in the run-off: "It has always been hurt by companies that have been infected with the desire of capital, which speculated and thought it may become major players.
It has never been my strategy.
Never had "dreams of a world power," says Andy.
Disregard the preceptor as the policy of this country, as he was Springer, and I don't want to play the world with "Time", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peak is extremely limited, serve only to explore the mail, without the ability to view a type of attachments or surfing in the network.
Did he enjoy their five minutes of fame in the US when he was welcomed by Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is difficult to see out there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphonů Peak is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount payable for example, for a data plan for the iPhone.
After his success, the company has started offering two new devices: One is intended exclusively for Twitter, second on the basis of permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for the Peak six changes amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday to try Le Web, is a European version of invention, and at the same time, his third transformation.
It is capped at as well as his American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes the roaming across Europe.
People travelling with smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently seek café with WiFi (or inserting Fon), so they can view the mail.
The idea of having roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be put in place for a long time.
Yes, some operators have specific contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics, in order to understand them, and very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has sought to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are available for the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern from the use of data services outside a home state.
The fact that such a machine like FonPeek (interestingly, still has the name Fon when there is no WiFi) reaches this type of fare, means that the operators are starting to think otherwise, and is considering various offers kterýmiby kompenzovali its data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers downloads of books and further searches on the Internet.
There are no contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and are due at the time of purchase, rather than the following months.
And that is exactly what I expect to occur once in případěFonPeek, it is a possibility to book with permanent access as the Peak has already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I am looking through the mail, on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think that it's from the point of view of the consumer boom type.
It would be interesting, if they gave the same system used on the computer.
Color, Michelle kterouzbožňuje
Yellow is undoubtedly favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For the emergence of Barack Obama as US president chose a dress and coat in this colour, the same color you also elected when she accompanied him on the second most important moment of his life: The transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: Besides the fact that this is a similar colour - lime with bright efekty-, in both cases, the ensemble třídílný - the clothes, the jacket and the jacket from the same látky- garnished with a large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States has decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess asturijské and wear similar clothes.
The substance, which is made of clothes, doing both models significantly different.
On the occasion of the investiture Michelle used a lace, in Oslo, velvet printed.
Changes and additions: Green shoes with medium-high podpadkem, nynípodobný model, but in a golden colour.
I wear different hairstyles: Tentokrátdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers to work problems associated with maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, particularly among women under the age of vintages, which they intend to take the child.
This is the result of the study's fertility and the career of Spanish women ', which is carried out by the CSIC institute in cooperation with the women.
The study was attended by 9.737 women aged from 15 to 75 years, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partner coexistence is the many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, as well as to the type of employment.
Women, who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable job, starting with a partner to live before, previously gave birth to their first child and generally have more children.
On the other side, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, a partner coexistence and motherhood shelved, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with stable jobs have their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the start of living with a partner. The number of 4.1 in the case of the women kterédosažení its stable jobs are dedicated to the greater part of his life, and thus have had to postpone the partner relationship, and the arrival of children.
The type of the profession has also had a strong influence on maternity, even if a smaller effect on the duration of living with a partner, "explains margaritas Delgado, devoted to the research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of anarození child's educational degree.
Research indicates that the higher the level of education, the higher is the age when women to marry and have their first baby.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years of women with the basic and higher education given birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
"There is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Women with basic schooling to marry and gave birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with a medium or high education ’ s reverse prefer to obtain a stable employment, before the conclusion of a marriage and the birth of the first child, "says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth it

What else could Celovi than do the famous at the expense of the glory of that man? "
A coward aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother through our neighborhoods, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed kolemní and our dog, crosses saved from the shelter weighing no more than six pounds, without a word nakopli it twice and critically wounded.
Our outrage is so that we can't see anything funny in such aggression against a small and helpless animal that has been on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident while on a walk with these individuals, she began to worry about their own safety, for such a devil of a man who attacks the animal is able to do the same, even as a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he was.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the normally tranquil neighborhood.
Dog all day proplakal.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint to the nearest police station, but pochybujeme, that it was for something, and we at a delicate questions, to say that these cowardly killers were Spanish nationality.
Outrage led us to this fact was announced.
We don't understand what's going on with the youth of today, if it's hurting defenceless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand, where's the proper manners, respect for animals and people.

The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of the use of helmets, since it is the only means by which can be avoided head injury or even death, in case of an accident while travelling on a motorcycle.
The company Michelin indicates that this campaign is part of their obligations regarding the transport safety, which means more than design and manufacture a safer products ", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose and otherwise, i.e., in the form of a briefing and information campaigns.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding on a motorcycle, under the motto "To be or not to be ”, is the first phase, when to more than 500 repaired vozidel boards will be stationed to get in.

The sales of light commercial vehicles
After nearly two years, the market is starting to light commercial vehicles.
All 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and what's more, it was the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to figures patronátní Anfac Ganvam organization of producers and sellers.
The positive data, however, it is better quarantine since November 2008, is a very bad year for benchmarking and marked a 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
The consequence is that, despite the rise in the past month, the total number of registered vehicles in the past 11 months, account for about 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January was prodáno95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: Derivatives of passenger cars, pick pneuservis less freight cars and light trucks / chassis.
And not even the gloom which harm the demand, even if it is bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made smaller and medium-sized businesses, and almost 100% of the cases, it is the financing through third parties.
Of the constraints arising from the conclusion of the source of bank credit is to be added, as well as other factors such as the cessation or continuing bad economic situation.
In that situation, in contrast to the coaches, support for the purchase of 2000E not helped.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention iosoby doing business to business license for small and medium-sized businesses, which they plan to purchase a light utility vehicle to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvamu reminded once again that there is a need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial cars (trucks and buses).
Authorities sellers assumed that the trend in 2010 will be the same as last year, according to the calculations of the sale of coaches and 4x4 falls on 19%.
Auxiliary system with the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of antiblokovacího ABS system, it will be with the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems of the handbrake, it all becomes mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, already form part of the required equipment all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is determined by the deadline for the removal of the shortage, which it is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, while it works so that it can help prevent many collisions.
Auxiliary system handbrake increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency case, that the system detects when a driver sešlápne.
But not always able to keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of car parts Bosch, a third of drivers who have been in an accident, nesešlápli apply the brakes before the collision and half of them did not exercise the full power brakes.
To 46 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance from the system requires brzdicího maximum, shortens the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted by the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, it could prevent up to 1 in 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
A reduction in this rate will be even more marked-based on calculations would avoid one of the four casualties with an impact on a person-following the introduction of the so-called intelligent systems of the handbrake.
In this case, the vehicle is fitted with a system that (using radar and cameras) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for the light braking.
If a driver is going to respond, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal, if it is needed.
If the driver does not react, even in the event of a collision cannot be avoided, the device will act as a brake on a nejintenzivněji and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors is postponing plans for Opel until the January
Nick Reilly, president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel's employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of the month of April -- probably 8 dubna- informed as Javier Ortega, an American manufacturer, warns that the recovery plan for Opel will need more time.

And, as a result, it may be that the final document, which will be presented to the staff of the first, and then the governments of countries in which it is located production plants, will be issued with a delay at the start of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, states that the decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in these days.
No wonder, then, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producer, to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some of the new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wished to acquire Volvo, but consider the Dutch maker of sports cars Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.

With the Porsche Boxster Spyder
This splendid model for the development of the company ’ s engineers have taken advantage of the Porsche Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight of about 80 kg, thus showing pouze1.275 kg.
On the basis of was, in the first instance, automatic convertible top is on the canvas version with the manual control, thus weight decreased by 21 kg; aluminum doors were used, such as the GT3, which means a further 15 kg less; the elimination of air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank of the 64-54 gallons also contributed to the reduction in weight by a further 7 kg; after their sport seats for the next 12 kg, thanks odlehčeným 19palcovým kolůmdalších five pounds.
Finally, the removal of the address system CDR-30 means another six pounds less and replace the door úchytek textile bracket (s) means further kilogram.
It also offers with dvouspojkovou PDK gearbox, it was tested in a vehicle with manual řazenou šestistupňovou speed chassis, mainly on the road in the second-class in California, on the mountain areas with many tricky curves.
His behavior may be regarded only as sacrosanct.
Reduction in weight does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt out of print.
It's just the opposite: We no longer netestovali so small and light model, which would also let a safety in the movement in the bend, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete able to warm up the muscles in the short run, after a sufficient period of time until he nenařídíme sprint, braking, and the renewal of the engine.
Whatever we want. Thanks to the procedure, which is so communicative as accurate, anything naznačíme hands on the wheel, which is what the car will do.
And it with surgical precision.
The will of the sound of the engine
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horses (about 10 more than the Boxster S) is a very fine good, and it's possible umocnit option 'sport', and through the system, which modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for Panamery.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, either in the air or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads, crossing with the Boxster Spyderem, was damaged but the car well managed bumps.
E-mail support was during the journey almost obsolete; and, at the same time, we're in some corners came at dawn on námrazu gravel and even in the late afternoon.
Finally, this ultralehký car is one of the most delightful on the market as something more than a mere mod Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010 for cenu70.831 euros.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when inflation assets amounted to the prevailing mood in the markets was once again showed the uncertainty in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is no longer the natural state in an environment where managers receive a decision on the future, which itself is uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market, it was the liquidation of debt through direct purchases of assets and an indirect free up liquidity at a rate of close to zero, so that financial institutions can buy assets to the deduction.
The central bank has already confirmed that direct purchases of assets has virtually ended, and without being questioned its disparate policy of liquidity, start throwing a bit of sand in the wheels as the Spanish Central Bank, with its auctions in the past year.
As a result, investors are questioning the ability of the world economy to sustain the economic recovery without so heterodoxních measures, and we participate in the return of the reduction in the risk-adjusted returns.
The volatility in stock markets and the differences dluhopisůspolečností re-gain points, although they are still very remote abnormal levels, which have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which has re-offended public debt.
Again, the pressure and the quality of the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the selected investors, thereby expanding differentiation of euro-zone countries against Germany.
Spain this instability has hardly affected, but at the same time, Standard & Poor's and threatened to a new revisions to reduce the capacity of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless for the mute supporters of moral hazard, who were re-tried to pose to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world ’ s economic policy for the application of destructive consequences of reducing the loan on employment, when in fact it should declare a new Thanksgiving.

It makes no sense for the Ecofin Council saving Hungary before the failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year, and to allow for the country ’ s membership of the euro complied with its obligations.

If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the standardisation of premiums from the transitional risk, after some excesech on assisted positions would have been within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will rise, as well as bonds of European companies, we don't have to worry about.
If the European differences will be reduced, and our continued to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. If our leading indicators are forcing most of its services to anticipate the recovery scenario studies and revise your script rise in 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to Japan scenario, for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for the great hope of survival to comply with this warning.
