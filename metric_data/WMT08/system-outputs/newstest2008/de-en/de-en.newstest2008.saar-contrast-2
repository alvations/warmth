Food at European inflation
The main reasons for the measured in the euro zone rise in inflation is the rapidly increasing food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone, the increase in November was higher than expected, after the 2.6% in October was an annual inflation rate of 3.1% registered as the statistical office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.
Official predictions are only 3% as a basis, announced Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) not lowered. According to your discretion would the rate of interest, the increasing commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment, the emergence of a spiral.
The ECB is anxious, the rate of inflation under two per cent, or at least short of the mark.
According to one analyst the ECB in the dilemma: one must the inflation "to" later need to be ruled out.
With 3.3%, the rate of inflation in November in Germany a; in Spain, the rate of upon 4.1%.
Responsible for the rise of inflation in the euro zone, the increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF rose by 88 per cent, and of course soybeans also reached a record since 1973.
Even in the case of food oil and milk products, there was a considerable increase in 2007.
The world market price for oil rose in this year by 52% - in the last month, the price per barrel of black gold almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation in the year 2008 from to 2.5% increase, but one with a fall in 2009 to 1.9%.
For the coming months of 3-4 comes out from a number of the annual average but with 2.1%.
For 2008 Experts reckon that the ECB the decrease.
Locates government crisis Gallup
After long stagnation, the number of the until the beginning of December, grew substantially. Since 2002, the party has the greatest base, while the agreement for the Socialists Gallup, according to an unprecedented low of 13% achieved.
In the case of the party faithful voters for the difference owing to the high determination of the clear: more than two thirds of (71%), a fifth (20 per cent) approval for the opposite.
And szdsz MDF, according to the survey among the parliamentary hurdle: they come in on two per cent of the total population.
The number of is in two camps around one per cent of voters.
In comparison with the last low the general economic atmosphere has worsened, never before had the proportion of those, the economic situation of the country as "really bad" judge, so high (41%), while another 46% regards it as "rather bad".
After prospects in the spring and summer, see the families who change their financial situation again pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth is of an improvement.
A survey carried out in December showed that 71% of the interviewees - a historical high - the work of the Prime Minister as bad "rather than" properly assessed.
Thirteen per cent of people asked have great confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the supporters of Viktor constitutes 38 per cent.
About 54% of trust which runs absolutely not compared with 27% of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of those who think that one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without changes of government in the grip.
After the riots in the last October, still 35% for the whereabouts of the government and of the Head of Government expressed today, this part amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33%), the resolution only in new elections.
For their interest in the referendum 60 per cent answered that they participate "with security", and another 20% of their vote "," it would give.
By comparison: if the Parliament at this Sunday, would only 55 per cent of "safety" go to the further 15% hold their participation for "probably." in the light of these trends, would be the result of the referendum foreseeable.
74% would be against the tuition fees, 79% against the charge and 84% against the vote.
Put down on the group at the plebiscite "safety" participate to the parts of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital charges even 81 to 84 / 89% are.
At the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in also have this year, the average increase in prices of 16% of the last year, with the difference that it this year no increase in the value-added tax.
Article from napi gazdaság
In the budaörser the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of over per registered.
After the prices in the food markets in the last December ",", the price increase not out to be drastically, compared with the already high, former level.
However, it has an effect on the consumers, certainly as a deterrent, that, in the last year for which they still far less had paid hoof, this year, not even for 10,000 is available.
The price of the "napi" shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof examined in the markets.
The highest price amounted hoof.
(was the price at 6.800.)
The prices for unicum and live fish, almost on increased strongly, however the prices for nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, when there was, however, for 139 forint.
It was with the product limited price slump with no less than 200 forint.
Surprising was here two Coca-Cola, the price of a bottle of less than 200 forint, thus including the drink cost pledge only 257.
Nevertheless this year in the "napi" at the most expensive, and at best.
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" shopping basket with the Christmas in the last year, around 15, while Tesco and cut each around 18 per cent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between shopping basket of last year and the current year constituted 21%.
The average rise in prices was 1.480,00.
The average increase in prices in the previous case was still 1,206.00, however, the tax increase with the prices at last Christmas apparent.
Exactly this process has met the trade badly: apparently the department stores could not so right to decide what price margin they should use in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in prices to the consumer were unforeseeable.
(if the vendor the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, it can by substantial profits fall in the price margin, after the choices).
The price increase of the "napi" goods in the past year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 by 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket only 844 forint fraud.
Such extremes were not observed this year, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a rise in prices of forint.
In comparison with the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic price increase the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months by more than 30%.
(this is not necessarily again confirms the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months, a more than a price increase.
So in addition to flour as well, for example in the case of eggs.)
If one takes a look, however, in the "napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price of the product is already in the previous year, even in the worst case by little more than 10 per cent.
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all, they could the drastic price increase pass on to the multinationals.
In the golden deplore the hypermarkets not; it is constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.
From all large quantities bought, lasting food go in over the counters.
Wednesday morning there was in all three department stores endless with the cash as suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is a smaller frequency reports, so that many multinationals with complain, they could not even reach the planned turnover, and not only in the case of food, but also with lasting materials.
In many places you
This year, more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors, the checking the infections is not good at all, as the leading doctor of the national.
In many cases, even in the case of the you.
In the traumatologie of to hospital, a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later, the man had to return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important operation could since then, because of the, which is still in the body of the patient is not yet to be carried out.
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, as the leading doctor of the national,.
So many activated by virus released infections were registered certainly in the hospitals, the true figure may be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the against methicillin-oxacillin of resistant triggered.
The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium contributes approximately one third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.
SA limited infections (such as inflammation of tonsillitis, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used arises from the good respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly develop.
In the case of patients with or permanently bad immune system, but also in age or patients with a low weight can these bacteria serious infections, such as infection or, therefore, cause.
The head of the medical according to hospital is nothing special, such incidents life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte a - there are not only there, where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carry rubber and masks at the supply, and we have the necessary for the treatment antibiotics - so.
With their admission to the hospital, the patients are examined, nevertheless an infection can always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of the initiated by infections in hospitals, would be avoidable, though the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of containment of origin or the spread of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa-infected isolate immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not, however, so frequently practised.
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health any subsidies for this investigation.
The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient is already a noticeable, according to the medical his of.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations to the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be called microbiological studies are necessary, so that any resistance to the funds can form, however, this directive of hospitals, does not always adhered to.
Under the or in the basic supply patients microbiological sampling are even more rarely, so.
You will at the
Scientific evidence to prove that of a patient, on the other, on the most frequent transfer of nursing staff.
So the hand washing or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however, there is also considerable shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.
To is transmitted through droplet or contact in the local hospitals, however, it is not always possible to isolate the patients.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds connected barely, although it is between them from the point of view of the epidemiological a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be.
As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in financially less well placed hospitals, even before that, in the case of you, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped, where these protective measures are adhered to, so.
The government program against to
In the grasp to get causes enormous costs for the health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of to, or their containment was held in the government program.
After the first signs of the program is successful, as published data prove the tendency of the declining in England.
The European Center for disease prevention (ECDC), the prevention of the emergence of viruses (including), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.

At present, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular plaster for purchases in Eastern Europe, with most and houses at sea.
Between the mountains, the regions bansko, borovec pamprovo and, to the most popular at sea albena ", the", the "," and the historical and the rather, however, real estate around kavarna and balcik demand more and more.
According to estimates by re. Analysts in Bulgaria also the interior sooner or later attract investors, as, for example, tarnovo, and triavna and also expressed the area of records more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers enticing offers, trade and surfaces offer high returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way of one of the most attractive European too, and, therefore, in addition to the summer and winter, also in the other two seasons to attract tourists.
Foresighted investors already purchase now on a large scale, for example about bansko.
According to strive for people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria, also a change of their way of life.
The most buyers are English, it is also, however, interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while it with the Black Sea and in the mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, say regional director of re..
Those who want to sit down to buy either real estate by 50-100.000 euro or shabby houses in order to 5-15.000 euro, which they then.
Good connection and accessibility, communication possibilities are written, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are crucial for the buyer.
The second category, who on the search for a are (Bulgaria was in December among the top ten vacation aims of the German listed).
The third group to make business people, with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
In the real estate capital are constantly more expensive, caused by the ever growing demand.
Within the European Union are the lowest in Bulgaria, in the last five years, however, there was a price increase by 21% annually.
The increase in the case of the real estate prices exceeds by far the increase the salaries.
And the six per cent of the Hungarian
As Secretary of the announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday, and at the end of the debate about the international after 2012 by the ministers on Wednesday, according to the official opening of continued.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries to discuss the schedule of Bali, in which the measures for the period after 2012, thus after the end of the Kyoto Protocol are fixed.
At present, an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries.
The USA has already, that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures, though, they would be ready to 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990, in order to reduce percent.
The big question is whether the Conference are ready, in addition to the reduction of emissions, the developing countries both financially and technologically.
It was also an agreement about the support achieved by developing countries.
The Fund is to put the Kyoto Protocol to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the Global Environment Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the "piac profit" read.
Hungary six per cent
Secretary of the supplementary in the name of Hungary the effort of the European Union, its pioneering role in global to maintain, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009.
The Minister said that the European Union until 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2010 (measured against the values of 1990), regardless of whether the "agreement after 2012" successfully achieved or not, the Union would be even ready for a reduction, other large industrial nations of the world, or developing countries are also ready to their obligations to forces and responsibly.
Of the stressed that the objective of the States which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the European Union with its back to a minus 15 Member States have already committed by 8%.
The guideline for Hungary is reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years - a handicap, the country will quite meet, such as in the press release of the Ministry of the environment is to be read.
The employment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012, which in this case would established in the Kyoto Protocol is not renewed, international consequences, whose importance also the IPCC, the international, with the Nobel Peace Prize distinguished Scientific Committee of the UN in its most recent report has stressed.
Through the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which according to the extremely serious and irreparable consequences for would entail.

Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department of risk analysis (risk division) of political capital activities in this August with support for the "movement for a better Hungary" founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect.
In the ", the" of the institute it means among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard represents the highest political risk the "increase the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary, even at short notice to violent discussions could lead".
The main reasons for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably on the provocation of such a discussion aims, so the Institute.
How will this report as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons regarded: "People of public life with representatives of the discussion of the radical political grouping, which now based their political strategy on the".
One assumes that this intensify the problem, the sensible dialogue impossible extremities as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments.
The forschungsinsitut means, the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, particularly regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity concerns".
We remember: since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary continuously in the lift, so that, since the summer 2007 several "national association" calling organizations were founded.
"these groupings in common that they each define as a civil organization, while it openly with the their members on - sometimes armed - tasks to prepare (national protection,), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army or the state, it was said.
And further: all this in accordance with the method which is different to the policies and of the population, based, political efforts as civil initiative to disguise.
The emphasis of the civilian character and the help that is not only the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration with the Court could emerge - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis has to be taken from the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor, also for the relations with the States.
"in the last months of the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of so many quoted politician in certain countries, the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not, therefore, in the political risk of increased for the entire region.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment in August 2007 by the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu) was announced.
In the background to the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were the, which in a district of Sofia (krasna poljana) have taken place.
The bnu has the incidents equal opportunity for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of the "national protection".
In your opinion, namely in the last 17 years, a real "terror" in Bulgaria, the State remained however idle and indifferent, so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose.
As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions will also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows, is it not exclude the fact that the Hungarian Roma also, with the organization of their own protection to the threats to react, it means in the risk of political capital.
Juhász Attila, in the case of political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year would be published annually and should is recognizable tendencies, the public opinion informed, as in the case by the publication of the risk.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly, so that the practice of working days around the holidays, established in the meantime, however, give us the coming year some such days.
Also in the European Union and in America, one means something different under "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.
Days are mostly church holidays or stand with important historical events in context.
We celebrate new year as well, for example: both the last day of the old, when the first day of the new year, are days - already so that the latter alone can rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
These are the 15 March at the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
Furthermore there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our Heads of State or religious holidays rarely on a weekend fall, the practice of the "," proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday, only one day would work.
The price of the prolonged weekends, though, that we on Saturdays in front of work very well, or must go to school.
When this day before or after the holiday, you should at long last be processed, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.

Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy
E-mails which we forget, we never received - harmless lies, which we do not notice: they bring "," at work to the weekday.
The only question is whether one of these small used, or is it better to the challenge and tries to this misleading, aggravating for other situations.
Tips.
"sorry that I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the referred - a colleague says".
That it has missed a meeting?
At best, one regrets it and attempts to make it again to when one perhaps with the calls and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the report that is the usual way).
The thing is usually dismissed with an excuse.
Before one oneself in excuses, one should consider, with one of his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There is hardly a little pithier as if one according to a document or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday was still on the desk - it is today?
Or will the believed lost ballpoint pens about on a colleague's desk?
No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed if they find that something disappeared.
Therefore, no covers or mail from the office in the bag because they could meet: no more, since, if one 's but urgently needs.
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means, one of which has already been put in the world, to stop.
Who, with whom, which made?
Where, and why?
One should the information (or assumptions) on the private life of the colleagues if possible not to tie the nose!
And if someone opens and its internal secret tells us, we should not abuse this confidence!
The best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of just is not present to adjust, even if other about the problems of the colleagues also know.
Without reason ill announced?
If one is in office in order to present itself ill with reference to tormenting headache report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should take a clear: the work of their own, urgent, projects with fixed dates must now the colleagues instead of a themselves.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one already knows at that one it at the next day do not get into office, or that something could interfere why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Hum, tittering, telephoning
One is right in his work deepened, but you do giggle disturbed by the colleagues?
Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (one over their heads,) moaning or permanent nerves.
All this can be very disturbing, even if it is not just in a task (write plan, organize) deepened.
Are the other always to blame?
A project is not ready in due time, one has a letter or important nachrichte, one should not forget to send the fault of its own forgetfulness not with other search!
As far as possible, one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one admits his errors and excuses if others were affected by this as well!
The question of how one mistake again, or which missed retrieve can only too missed!
In the office - a feeling like to home?
Pants and schlapfen: force for at home, but in the office lost nothing!
Not even then one should so casually dress, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, and also itself as far as respect, that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
It all as to do - or as one becomes uninteresting
Stop and, the car right in the traffic.
From the radio a strange sang: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn to the higher volume.
The pace of changes to the previous sounds comes sounds and as a real a female chorus.
It is the song "of love" of that on onmr2.
The local music has for a long time, not just with delicately.
However, now one sees even the back-up differently, when one hears the new album of.
The appearance of to so many new and exciting production from the local digital underground contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and even if the garage, with its gitarrengequit again "," the domestic proves: there are new under the sun.
In pécs Balázs ranging, even in the volumes to before it, perhaps because a pub no two piper - its own path to follow.
The breakthrough with its project (zagar) and its music which elements from jazz, electronics and pop made it created, but only as one with the request the a film to compose it had approached (e.g.
"szezon" of Ferenc toeroek).
The formation, which was originally appeared in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 among the top 50 local and zagar, together with the almost only to, even in the West trendsetter marketable.
Without a doubt, and its volume "trendy", it is, however, not interested in whether they also like to bear this brand.
The volume reacted as it: with a new, still better album.
The new published now with the title "cannot walk fly" could open up new paths for them, however, already the title expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs was still away with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be in order, however, to fall apart from the character of the music - the time and the trend of appropriate louder the influences the rock 'n' roll.
With these songs living in England and with the volume of "the jigsaw puzzle" working singer himself with the premiere in presented.
A song from album it even to the created - has been one of early to pop music late "this pet the listeners with the number" of love ", the cooperation of six local singers (" ") was taken up gradually set.
Everything in order so (?).
The hvg.hu enquired at Balázs.
Hvg.hu: this new raises the question: to what extent does your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs: the term "," I do not just mean much.
In my opinion, there are two classes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and or alternative and pop but commercial and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground can shallow and meaningless, just as they can also, however, only for the sale produced, which makes it commercial music.
Even a good can arise from an honest motive.
The acceptance of listener functions independently according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music?
As zs. Abroad, particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.
There is not only teenagers or on concerts, but also the older public.
They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen around them, much more, because they also for a part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role is the public with your work?
It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?
As zs.: of course it is a good sense, to see that more and more to come to our concerts.
However, we have never for the market.
With us, music does not result in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there again only in the unreachable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one struck me: if you make it all right, you are not more interesting.
Hvg.hu: how far you to follow the example of?
It is as away and his career in the West.
As zs. We don't really its way, quite apart from the time that one tries again and again, this in our music.
We see rather than on the musical presence of other trust and it unfolded.
Originally were naturally compare our work with that of to inevitable, as several of us come from his band and have taken another way.
Hvg.hu: in the wings of "wings of love" stands in the first place.
Many have only in connection with this number belonged to the names.
Was the opening with a somewhat scale in the direction of a wider audience conscious?
As zs.: we had no plans to write a of the then shall suffer for the album as.
In this song, it is a matter of more.
It was considered as a final of the, with which we, the and the somewhat more difficult subjects wanted to dissolve.
Hvg.hu: how have you the six selected?
Why is it, which was the guidance principle?
As zs.: the idea was to make a gospel chorus.
Then came the idea, the chorus from talented soloists of the local music scene.
So sechsköpfige chorus resulted, therefore, for sena edina kutzora, péterfy, eniko "hodosi [neo], sena, -, then we apäter" "underground.
Hvg.hu: you have the song exactly the same, or do have it the girls?
As zs.: there was the number already longer in the version, but as the material for the was finished, we thought that this number is still "something needs".
The piecework has really after a voice.
I have the melody still in the same night, then they have learned the girls.
It was practically everything at once and alarming spontaneously.
I can remember that at that time, I was quite, but it also has already the "," required.
With my voice alone the song would never have become.
Hvg.hu: both on the record, and with the concert had one, but the impression, the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for the short solo of), they do not have any of its own role, completely sing together and are not louder than the music, therefore, their gesang of music is not only accompanied.
Also on the stage they stood back.
Is it intention?
B.zs.: that they stood behind, was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we wanted to make them aware of any social.
In number, it is also a matter of around the fact that one of its ego a little forget should forget who come from and where it is on the way, can we simply to us that this particular wing, the wings of love.
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition, we felt, as the song developed.
Hvg.hu: what was the most complex song?
As zs. Actually the musical none, it has been rather with more difficult tasks.
For example, in the case of "dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I on a play, or in the case of "rock 'n' roll goes to the girls, where the longer did not work, but gradually everything together, as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your of the new album?
As zs.: changes with the concerts constantly and now, where I have the "losgelasssen".
At present there are "prophet is a", "escape from the earth" and the number of "the seed".
Because broker risked because of inferiority feelings billion
Bottomless crooks
So calls its former employee of the French Société Générale, the owner of the local banka.
They came to him by nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather like that in only a big player, which it was like his colleagues wanted to do this, surely not was unable to.
In contrast to all big houses it in time the crisis on the amerikanischenn.
"It is psychologically rather weak" was heard from the mouth of its supervisors, the reported it to the police.
As follows from the statements in the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, published, he was a man, at the end of last year, with its business profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euros had obtained.
Crisis, not only in America?
"everything I wanted was for my bank to earn money," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he had succeeded in just at the American crisis to earn half a billion euro.
The opportunity for it had already at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first reports about so-called mortgages, as they low-income consumers or such which had already in former times, given that would be in trouble.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however.
In did not believe that and was right.
At the end of the year, he had his profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
", as I already had earned the first half billion, I did not know how I should explain that" and continue to say that he had kept definitely nothing for itself.
During the whole it admits that it forged documents, so that one would not come it on the.
He even succeeded in its leaders behind the light to lead, even if gradually in for interested in its business.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
No.
"I think that it is the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the Bank, satisfies."
Where did he has the courage to risk so much?
He had his position gradually.
It came into the in the year 2000, immediately after it be studying at the University of Lyon had completed.
Its annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005, it was an independent broker, with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others.
"already during my first discussion in the year 2005 I knew that you have observed.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "said the investigator.
However, soon after its entry took the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance he earned much when it at the London bomb attacks half a billion euro on this title,.
And that was the trip - now he wanted more.
As long as you make profit, we let you
"this is like a snowball", he told the policemen.
However, the leaders of supposedly knew of all or suspected it.
"as long as I money earned one closed the eyes."
But then came at the beginning of this year, the great impact.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to adjust.
When it came to the work on Monday, it was not more 'of the Bank.
And, a few days later, the Bank announced that they lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come it on the?
He made suspicious through a holiday.
"I have only four days from the previous year.
A broker, takes no vacation is one, which does not want that one looks him into the maps, "said in conclusion.
The has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday, a total of nine development programs, through which the Czech Republic in the next few years to 14 billion euros (for example) 365 billion Crowns can come.
It is a matter here of approximately half the sum, the ones in the years 2007 to 2013 at all from Brussels can obtain.
Approximately 125 billion Crowns come from seven programs.
Czech companies about 100 billion Crowns from the agenda "of enterprise and innovation" allocated can get.
Most money, approximately 150 billion, in the traffic flow.
The traffic program is covered the largest development and covers up to 22% of the funds, the ones can get from the Fund.
This money, according to the budget of the State, the next year 90.8 billion will have.
The "of enterprise and innovation" shall serve businessmen and companies, funds for innovative undertakings.
The companies are thereby finances for the introduction of new technologies, for research, but also for the introduction of more effective organization methods.
In the case of the previous aquisition from EU funds belongs among the new countries to the so far at least successful.
A court confirms twenty detention for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty detention for the former President Arnold out, to which he deceit in 2003 because of the level of 100 million dollars (almost billion Crowns) had been sentenced.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on its hazienda at the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997) until 2002, this Central American state again comes behind bars, is currently unclear according to the news agency.
The chairman of the Court of Appeal, ileana Pérez, as a result of which it will now depend on whether one can serve his sentence at home, or whether it into prison.
Four years ago, a Court proved that regularly money the government on the accounts of foreign companies in Panama had moved.
These companies were fictitious and in reality the accounts belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money is finally landed in a fund for the financing of his election campaign in 2001 had established.
Budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without support the opposition was accepted by the.
For the current year still with the support of the ssd (social democrats) approved because it Minister (of this party) had submitted, and it therefore could not allow to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved this traditionally considered, nevertheless, some highly meaningful law calmly.
This is to a certain extent paradoxical.
This rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.
The budget is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the power of the government and the opposition.
This is a subject for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to it.
A fight among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a bare figures.
The national budgets suffered at the last social democratic governments under three weak points, the budget for the year 2008, not at the same time can eliminate:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure, because of law obliging, whereby it is not only about the pensions, but also about social, the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communist) in the last year before the choices.
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the local authorities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
However, a true time bomb is the deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors distributed by except gains from taxes, and bank loans further sources for investments, often mostly bonds, through which they their in excess responsible.
In the last few years they managed to these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.
Now this source already dried up.
As far as we only at official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through which the incessantly himself boasts.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order.
Instead, these governments were to the state, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Pakistan, Albania or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a giant disgrace, which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, seen in the global scale, at least are threatened by poverty.
Therefore, no nassiven social which, unfortunately, just in the last few years very in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is successful, a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year before the elections, to delete if it is clear that in next time not to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension, then virtually any policy in this country, and, all the same, who is in power, he will not have anything as pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated, if one says that then from the dominant politicians, civil servants are the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social divide.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal expenditure by duty areas.
The planned for 2008 deficit of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments not spent in the last ten years, which would have only worked.
If we do not want that it really comes to that from the dominant politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte, then we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of the fact that the State, just as much as it can take to taxes and charges in the situation is, rest with the preparation of further wish.
Only these make a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets.

Banks want to overcome crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together against the crisis on the financial markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, the banks auction of interest rates, to which they are ready to lend each other money.
For example, the American fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction further 24 makes them for the European Central Bank and the Swiss.
It is for the notices, is the first time that the central banks of the individual States on such a coordinated procedure for the defense or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
"this step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, the increasing lack of free capital, which the banks can lend" wrote in a report for its customers Bernard pool of the consultancy firm economic group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks of the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added in his report.
The banks have because of not loans already around 60 billion dollars, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect still further losses.
"," the central banks must have in fact been afraid of it, which still everything can follow as to this procedure decided, "said of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
It appears that the situation is really bad, "said it further.
The central banks, the fear that if the banks themselves have access to loans for their customers credits even more expensive.
This would reduce the consumption and the American economy in a recession, possibly with effects on the growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided, after they had not succeeded, the so-called the lower rate of between banks used.
This means that the banks were afraid constantly each other to lend money, and although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"which will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg salvaggio from Reuters tense consulting of the Agency.
Some are of the opinion that this step for the central banks of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and indeed the case of property in the USA.

The Czech President emphasized at the idea of his book that the subject is very important for it, and that it therefore it in such a way.
He expressed its satisfaction over the fact that his book published in German translation of ", because I often on caricatures of my views.
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting.
Klaus reminded that it was not klimatologe, but it has its opinion, sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.
It is finally a capable of technical discussions to understand and to judge has experience with statistics and is also.
As a main of the book he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changes and that its changes that it is normal for the global warming no concurring opinion among the scientists, that the results of the current changes are not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate is ineffective expensive and.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experiences with totalitarian, unacceptable, other unproven views upon, it regards as dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions of present explained it repeated, it is not a sensible environmental protection, but against militant who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and return. "
On the same subject Klaus in Vienna had already two months ago in the spoken.

Some years later came to the thought walachische passports.
From a originally funny action a business and a business activity out at the foundation of the company then "walachisches Kingdom" attached.
In 1997 polívka agreed to the use of its name and his signature in the passports and offered to their owners, even reductions during the visit of his farm and its ideas.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also to that of the only the bare idea used, in the transmission of "ring" for its business intentions has made.
"The popularity polívkas the project of the walachischen Kingdom reliably," said the judge.
It added, however, that the soul of the project? and his team are dedicated to it intensely.
The cooperation of the present quarrelling parties lasted until the year 2000, as for in the official on organized.
Since then, however, between polívka themselves and to accumulate the quarrels, which culminated in the "King boleslavs I. chosen to sinking never flax day".
The leading role then took on as a Queen Mother up.
2002 then reached? and its firm against the complaint, the Court rejected today.
Clarity in the argument could of competition prepared by the throne and a half princess.
A new King should result from it.
Details and deadline it did not yet.
We want nothing.
It should thus be something like the one in the move.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Mr polívka also can make an appointment quietly "added.
The test Peugeot 207 1.6 1.6: voruteile shrink
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206.
His were not much value, the quality of which refer to the control and also the processing, one could describe as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and this is much better.
The combination of with the name sw is still a piece of further, and it only remains for me to revise my opinion.
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to me, for example, about the low on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.
Fast further
I have only just go through, in order not to repeat me too much.
It is a quite excellent design, where I only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and are the times past, where we perhaps have to short seats or.
Also, in comparison with the 206 substantially.
What the space concerns here, one can also feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In combination is also the already mentioned the lack of eliminated.
In the trunk suitcases
The main point at this car is, however, the cargo hold.
I must now also because of the reverse) as a very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb can and do even more difficult objects.
However, we talk about the drawer volume.
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 in comparison with the competition, which is a rather average value.
However, not in comparison with the vehicle of this class, the? fabia,.
If we have the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare, we find that the Peugeot by clearly perceptible 52 behind.
For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must still the according to the whole of the down mention turning back seats or even the very low mention.
120 transportation in four numbers
It was with a capacity of 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 equipped.
And, frankly, should look like a family, a family.
It is low, has a low consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda, which sometimes seems as if its with a rag clogged, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
However, we must remember that we have a good car equipped with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of cars with the 1400th petrol engine at the level of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our engine it costs as 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot.
The equipment of the strikes once again with 80000 crowns besides.
We had, however, automatic air bags, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters back and and...
So the car costs in total simple 531900 crown.
That is a lot, but you calculate the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore, only the decision, which mark one wants to choose.
Integration Slovakian pupils in britschen schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from the countries of Eastern Europe, what with the local worries about the further development of the local education.
The integration of the east Europeans pushes up to now on a number of obstacles.
British schools, even in cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants of violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to britschen schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where the discussions between the local and Slovak immigrants gradually increased.
Quarrels, harassment and among students have on the relations between the parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in a Slovakian woman, a ten-year boy with a had beaten.
The accused defended in this way, that the young it with racist insults insulted.
The police had even after an attack of two minor girls on a Slovakian immigrant as well.
The girls were against the man supposedly racist remarks made and compare it with stones.
"when we went home, a young on a bus and spat on us.
As I said to him, he should stop, it us with apples and pears and then be described, "a mother of Slovakian pupils of the newspaper the another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the local referred to the controversy with the immigrants from Eastern Europe, even as a survival fight.
The aforementioned cases testify that the atmosphere between local and immigrants in British schools always strained.
In Great Britain 70000 Slovaks are reported, which came to work search here.
For instance 30000 Slovakian students attend accordingly British schools.
Cuba, the beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is in fact an island of freedom.
What they expect of their holidays, that will be fulfilled if they select only the correct.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with at the beach offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you find that in measure.
Only on an island, however, still find it much more, and these island of Cuba is the largest and most beautiful great Antilles.
At present the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the capture of America.
It called Columbus the most beautiful place, which has seen a human eye.
Havana was once a camp or transit of treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American period.
The hotel as completely came into being at the end of the 20th century.
Building made it one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano for everything in the USA was regarded as a crime (particularly during the prohibition on Cuba) was most welcome and support, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Under its guests, among other things.
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, grew drove over the broad boulevards cars, to the cult of the 1950s years among the ritual.
Ernest Hemingway bought a estate in San Francisco de Paula, near and he had in his yacht lie.
The walls of the bodeguita del Medio Star of behind and politicians from the whole of America their signatures.
And today?
The walls of the bodeguita of Havana can also they leave it.
At the bar in the hotel as one for the whole cocktail desired.
And the cult of the 1950s to drive around in Havana until today, because the imported once and Fiats in the and damp air fell apart a long time ago.
This Havana, in particular its oldest part heavily anywhere, one finds in the vicinity so many colonial objects of interest as just here.
Other places are just straight, for example, Trinidad.
In regard to the urgently needed, that tourism brings money, there was for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years, not only in Havana new hotels developed, but also in varadero, on the coast of the province holguín and also on islets as cayo Coco, cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique in the world, and particularly railway lover.
The railways brought the steam of remote and to the factories.
Their fleet was not renewed over decades, and so one sees there and fully operating locomotives, their contemporaries contemporary elsewhere in the museum.
Trip goals
The places makes the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
So one must above varadero or Havana no longer have to write.
It only remains to mention that in the already mentioned estate a museum, whose visit that one of these writer, it should not miss.
The viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the angles of Cuba.
The luxurious vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, lime hill and rocks tower steeply from the in their hollow accumulated fertile soil, through which also covered by a thick adopt.
It is this valley, where perhaps best Cuban tobacco cultivated.
In its final form, you can meet him if it one of the visit Havana.
Perhaps some also interesting, it appears that the Chilean, as a result of the television series of "major Zeman" was turned.
Trinidad
An ancient city, shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island, was set up.
The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the beauty of the small town.
The Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, between the sea and the sited, is such a remote place that there was still in the fifties of the last century was no road, the area is connected with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained.
Nothing was built, but also therefore nothing down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over the head.
If one considers Trinidad more than one afternoon time has, then, it is interesting to look at places in the environment, such as the beach playa ancón or the valley of the factories ".
In the evening, one should then in the Casa de la go according to the darkness, and where the music until tomorrow, not silent.
Baracoa
This completely in the East of Cuba some describe as the most beautiful the island.
Surely this opinion is also affected by the way there.
Both roads, the lead of Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape, which is scarcely touched by human interventions.
These Eastern Cuba took up the UNESCO owing to the there unaffected nature in her.
There is the best chocolate manufactured in the church, one shows the Cross of Columbus (in reality, it is about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus developed), and of the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel Castillo, that is, to see that several of these El yunque is the best known.
Over the coffee, the rum, which cigars, the Sierra, the Bay and the island Isla de pinos over the heiligtum the Cuban patron caridad del cobre over the santeria an African religion, to which the descendants of slave declare, above all the one could write many pages.
However, as one says so: better with its own eyes looking.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
Too little soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, the United States, as a result of the process of the mission in Afghanistan.

The number of force actions is compared to the previous year by 27% in the southern province helmet and even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, from approximately a quarter in southern territory.
According to the United States the allies but at an absolute border, which concerns organization and equipment of the units.
They demand further concrete helicopters, soldiers and experts to the training of the Afghan units.
We will seriously about the concrete objectives for the next time and about the way they have, as we can accomplish gates said.
Similarly, today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.

We have about Ninety per cent of the soldiers and equipment, which we need, and this is too little, "said the Agency de Hoop Reuters, for the end of discussions with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Under the participating countries over the last months also argument about whether all allies give their best in Afghanistan.
Because of, for example, criticized.
"the Germans are relatively numerously represented in Afghanistan.
They are stationed in fields where there is only a minimum of control and which are for them not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said gates.
The British "sun" called this week the German soldiers rotten furs.
"Afghan idlers exposed: the German make games during our boy fight", "the sun" in a contribution, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers who play.
The German picture newspaper proceeded and printed a picture of a British unit with a in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debts are in the year 2009, on a trillion
On every Czech a national debt of 84000 crown.
The total rose by the end of September to842,7 billion Crowns.
The government had planned this year with billion to cause.
At the beginning of the Ministry reduced thanks to the better development of the State plan, however, on 152,8 billion.
The Czech Republic rose by the end of September to842,7 billion Crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year, they therefore increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, they have, however, about 13.4 billion.
The Exchequer confirmed his information about the national debt of at the beginning of October.
On every Czech a debt of 84000 crown.
Over the past year, the state by more than 111 miliarden crown.
"until now it seems that we owing to the lower deficit for the coming year, the limit of one trillion crowns possibly only in the year 2009 will exceed.
Next year the debts should between 900 billion and a trillion crowns said David Marek analyst the Patria finance the server
It looks like Vladimír, analysts of the next that: "to the excess of one trillion we could in the course of the year 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it should turn out that the situation is changed on the political stage, and should be ready to save more could last up to the year 2010.
However, such a change, I do not come from, "he noticed.
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes primarily from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.
The national debt is financed by national financing, direct loans or, for example, through the European Investment Bank loans.
The domestic public debt rose this year to 719,4 billion Crowns in the meantime.
In the meantime, the foreign debts of the State rose by 1.7 billion Crowns 1,7 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of September billion Crowns and diminished by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
"the entire increased over the year from the first to the third quarter by 1%, which is really a lot in view of the economy is well.
It is interesting that the growth, above all with the bonds, where the increase amounts to 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt rise, but on the other hand this shows that one can do something already before the pension reform comes ", the data.
Better than expected
From the financing strategy and dealing with the national debt for 2007, that the government had planned for this year billion Crowns to incorporate.
At the beginning of the Ministry reduced thanks to the better development of the State plan, however, on 152,8 billion Crowns.
This amount is primarily due to the national budgetary deficit, which obviously this year 76 billion Crowns instead of the estimated 91,3 billion will reach.
Further is by no means for the planned in the amount of consolidation agency billion Crowns, one for the payment of the pensions, the financing of for 43 billion and rates for the loans with the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
For this, that it is a given a name, it was presented for a court in Khartoum today.
After indicating their lawyer, the British teacher in the Sudan, because an insult of Islam had been accused on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of detention and following classification.
The Briton was accused of six to seven year allow students to have a bear the name Mahomet to give, although any representation of the prophet is prohibited.
They have earned it.
After parents of pupils several times with the Sudanese had complained to the Ministry of education, education and cultural, of the high school of unity was active, on Sunday to be taken up at home and according to Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code to the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to choose a name for the choice.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports Robert boules.
Finally, when the select class votes to 20 of 23 children Mohammed as like first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Prophet, but above all, as well as a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Then the children a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on this and the "my name Mohammed.
The bear did not carry a label with this name, but the problem is, quite simply, that the representation of the prophet of Islam is regarded as an insult.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons at the same school teaches in Sudan, said that he knows it well, and they would never have done something with which they could get a religious faith too near, I only regret that it has asked the children, for a name to vote his opinion is only an innocent error.
An opinion, numerous pupils of the teacher share these as very attentive to their pupils and as a person who never talks about religion in the class describes.
It considers that the first name of Mohammed simultaneously in Great Britain on even the most frequent given, for which in English 14 different exists.
This first name often selected by Muslim families is regarded as a kind of respect in the prophet (it is frequently the given a family).
But what are the rules in the reference to the use of this?
One may give a toy him for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.

The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.

Nevertheless, the experts there can be no safe forecasts.
Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December on the stock market, usually with a positive market trend accompanies
It is not advisable, forecasts at short notice and only on the basis of statistics, above all, then, if not tensions which can be taken seriously current market determine
Although other experts a such strong in the last weeks of the year does not approve of this nevertheless say that the share of the liquidity of the market and of the market participants invest. This is certainly due to the lack of safe fund mainly in funds, which, by the revaluation-running trend towards net assets strongly is concerned.
Therefore, according to the opinion of these experts stock rather a rather of market fluctuations have influenced, particularly because we do not yet the scales of possible fall in the interest rate of the US able to assess a uncertainty, particularly on the price and the danger of the increase in the rate of inflation is due.
Javier barrio, chairman of the case of bpi in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a daring time an imminent rally to announce.
The chances are not very well at the expert.
The Spanish share index has already since its maximum mark on 8 November of points to a value of 4%.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at the ibex 35 could due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, every year, around this time made of the pension fund, this year to compete successfully with almost points.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that this year the things somewhat differently could develop; above all, on the basis of the already in the second week in December and, accordingly, directly after the bridge the day of the Constitution, taking place.
In the view of the analysts the price fluctuations would not affect the market.
In the opinion of Federico olucha, analyst with the Bank, the previous judgments for the market on an almost technical level, which could lead to that shortly a deviation from the abzeichnen could mortgage market of the consequences of the crisis.
The analyst trusts in the fact that these turn out to be positive.
With the selection of the values which shall advance the ibex to new, are the analysts agree.
Solana of intermoney declares that this year the great values are.
To the expert would be the two banks and some real estate companies, since the current sector to given time will be too expensive.
Meanwhile Federico olucha of the Bank, that the increases in connection with the Bank and in industry sector.
If the actually occurs, the property of their beneficiaries.

Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December showed sinking course processes only in two cases.
At the end of 2003, as the burst this led the stock exchange from their crisis and initiated at the same time the last real.
This year, in which the ibex 35 by 28.17 percentage points December showed a course of 6,68%.
Whether in 2008 the fifth profitable year in consequence will (rises since January by 8.36%) and also a can produce, will show.
Popular will its 200 credit institutions of Fridays on Mondays to 12 hours on the day opened.
Popular decided on a large part of its branches to modernize.
A total of 200 of them are established in the economy strongest regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name popular Max mean that addresses a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes as popular as the first represents the leap dares lengthen the opening hours of its branches up to extend and at of to apply.
The, which also the extension of its opening hours in the branch offices of repeated reads, has so far still no definitive resolution.
At the time of the negotiations of the Bank, with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement at the 75% of all branches are closed and for it to a weekday open in the afternoon, if not for the customers.
Whether further banks of the new initiative, which adapts to the empirical values of the popular will depend on bank.
And that is just as well, the intention of which pursues popular with its project.
It is objective, the opening hours to extend those branches, on the basis of their situation, the custom of independent, small and inclined to buy enterprises, but also those of the great department stores can include.
The Bank would like the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, since it is not new, but changed opening hours.
But the Bank will transform the premises of those addresses, which are already in business, and at the same time the individual of the different zones to adapt.
So the extension of the opening hours with a new room organization of the branch offices which stands by a more current, more colorful design.
The responsible representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments, but with an increased personnel attitude, since a branch office is now no longer six, but eight or nine employees now.
The subsidiaries, even with the additional premises for the SMEs will be equipped, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the Group
Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tried.
And the empirical values turned out positively, according to.
The offices of the roads Bravo murillo O ´ and grain have been selected for this, which appears to have been a clever resolve.
Popular leads at the moment about 2500 addresses.
And another 60, which operate under the name and specialize in immigrants and have also extended opening hours even on Sundays and holidays.
In this branch of the model of the bbva not used, since most of them instead to a wide choice of procedure for sale.
We would like to represent any competition for our customers, explain Rivero.
With Telefonica, they are temporarily come to the agreement with the help of external of mobile telephones, to sell.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles the first times its market value and an outdated, therefore, his rivals antena 3.
We have managed it.
With this sentence was the managing director of, Paolo his views with satisfaction the sender guided by it had its value to double its rivals 3 increases.
One aspect, however, subdued his joy: this is exactly what has been violated; not that we have a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he stated.
He stressed that they, in spite of the weak market not sunk too deeply.
Telecinco concluded yesterday the day with a positive balance of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses of this year on 15,66%.
According to information from Bloomberg reaches the 4,488.88 million euros now Mediaset, in which the main part of the capital (52%) is controlled, and vocento only 13% is involved.

The market value of other stock increases; on the other hand, in the case of sogecable on 3,571 million, with prisa (editor of the magazine días) on 2,518.53 million and with vocento on 1,779 million.
The comparison with 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises, so Vasile.
Appears on the question of to what extent we can actually do, at what price and how we can design on customer.
Telecinco declared its plan a week ago, this year for the first television station, with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising. Tringali ago this assured, the managing director of the insured and the group.
If the project should be converted to the sender his in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year by 3.6% increase.
In the case of 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months (up to 734,4 million), while the net income from the only an increase of 0.7% (630,4 million), show business.
The main factor for the better in the comparison of seeing the or the high, the company could show up to the present time: in 2006, as the enterprise guided by Alejandro a 100-prozentige.
Vasile damages, however, that the reason for the purchase of 33% of the shares of final moles with MEDIASET as a parent company, nor could vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise at least 50% of the shares out, even if we have always considerably more stated.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stocks we through the purchase of 33% of the final were already able to increase.
After the analysts statement at the time of certain on.
Lehmann brothers reduced only recently his at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the reduction of the expected growth rate of the 2008 / 2009% 8.4% and by 5.5% to 5.1% will diminish.
This also has the prospective calculation of 3 for 2008 and 2009 by 4.5% to 7.5%.

The former Minister José Bono has the offer of and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is it the list the PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo cite and, in the case of an electoral victory of the Socialists, the office of the.
So it José Blanco, the PSOE and Bono in the press conference after today in the headquarters of the party, a meeting with President Zapatero took place.
In the view of the head of the offer to the former Minister justified, since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and Bono among the best.
In addition to the coming from the Mancha politicians in the case of a victory for the Socialists at the next elections, to all appearances, as chairman of the Convention for the party.
Bono would Manuel Martín as. This had announced on past 15 November, at the next general not any more, his career in public policy and instead to conclude in the university field for the climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that the continuously since its resignation two years ago on his return to the political event would have pushed.

Climate propaganda
Since the both the sceptics of climate change and those that put a social and political debate in the foreground to a merciless criticism unterzieht, must the movement as a whole strong cohesion on the day.
Above all, if it is a question of a leader of the movement, as in the case of Zapatero, the fight against climate change for more important as regards the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests a new contract with the planet to sign.
This proposal makes it, however, in a declaration concerning the action, or of his government, which has decisively contributed that Spain, within the European Union at the top of the countries which the guidelines of the least fulfilled.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-payment of the guidelines, on which sectors, and this is why his government has the contract with the planet had suggested, not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to the Spanish citizens of the intended measures against him to explain the climate change without beating about the bush.
What companies will be affected by the citizens, which is supposed to be changed, which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and what economic consequences arise from it.
More specifically, who sacrificed and pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, it has and there will be no such explanations in the future.

Because the measures against the climate change, which can really be used are unpopular.
They are uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the proposed by the PSOE appeared Zapatero seen so dangerous that he felt compelled to take back the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now the planet with nothing, therefore, with a pure propaganda and empty sayings, without any real consequences to save.
With impressive statements commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the otherwise so suitable for election campaigns politicians talk neither still accuse still claim, however, instead of demanding expenditure to follow the meeting decorate and with its quality of this and other inspire.
However, this can only happen if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not claim that the bicycle in the future the single progressive movement or we only with a fan may.

Therefore the through the monthly payment feelings on the content of the colleagues.
The study was with the help of a tomographisch-magnetic reference analysis at the Bonn university, and the results were created in the final version of the science published.
After statement Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn life & brain research was the activation of the strongest at the time when the participants correct answers, and on the other hand his other player failed.
The researchers were able to recognize that the very moderate always contributed, if both participants with their answer were correct and therefore also got the same salary, but if one of them received the double, it also came to a stronger.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires as much scientific effort to reach such a result.
The public prosecutor from the Balkans

What insurance is suitable for me the best?
The insurance, a possible claim caused by the driver covers, contains a high cost, whose level of various factors depends, among other things, of age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, kind of the insured, cars and its use, etc.
To have a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the right vehicle model.
First, it must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is in writing by means of a versicherungsvertrags held, which specifies that the society receives and in exchange is engaged in a claim the corresponding compensation.
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors, and other age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that, in the event of a higher danger of accident, even higher payments due.
For this reason both via women make less payments, because statistics prove that these groups, thanks to their caution show a lower accident rate.
The same also applies to married people, since these after statement of the statistical values and therefore also for being one of the enterprise, fewer accidents tend as singles.
The use of the vehicle is attributed to influences the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more probable the damage.
With the installation of the insurance premium must consider a whole series of points.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly exactly the car insurance to select the most likely approaches his personal needs.
We do this now, the most important points, the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account, in order not only an achievement - but also a oriented choice to be able to meet.
The less than 25-year-old meetings with the choice of a reasonably priced insurance numerous obstacles, such as the small and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover best would be a sign, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a full hull with, so that the services of a were covered, but at a low price offered.
This type of contract contains that the customer a portion of the amount resulted from the damage must pay.
The amount is before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the premium; this is more highly the smaller the sum to explain Luis Noguera, main agent of Spain with Europe, an arrangement for on-line.
Another option is the extended insurance, the customer against external damages, however, against the damages developed at the own car.
In addition to this kind of insurance theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases by trying to travel and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the case of the appropriate insurance company.
In the opposite to contain a payment an increase of said rate.
The amount of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and their returns.
If the enterprise a rich year behind it, can allow itself to increase, explains.
As soon as the exceeded it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks.
Therefore, it is the most sensible for a full with deduction to decide.
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident as at the time of the driving not to describe the practice of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur after the fear of beginner.
Nevertheless, it is in the case of a married customers, who does not possess children a sign; of course, only then, if it is the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows.
On the part of married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low also their payments.
In this case, would be a fully with deduction (at an amount around 300 Euros.), the best option in the case that one received a high credit, recommends an extended insurance, the first for the third year.
You go in total relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to a larger contribution payment determine Luis Noguera.
It is good for pensioners, with a full deduction (at an amount around 150 euro), or an extended insurance which does only at a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible, but also because it high costs, which require it, that a thorough choice is made, which corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the final
The frame Milan and the Celtic Glasgow on next Tuesday in San fight for the point of them, by their respective objectives still before the conclusion of the need to achieve the Italians, the point about at the top of their group, while this is to arrive at the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team has already five points and their participation is already in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal confirmed during the Celtic Glasgow, with a further nine points still need to go for certain that the round with the befica Lisbon with six points with four points not catch.
The two plays the group D will a week before the end of the sixth game take place, since the frame Milan at the club world championship must begin in Japan, where it at in the semi-final for the first time by the entry into the final fight, which occurs at.
So this group will be concluded before all others and draw in ago at to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win the Italians will not want to speculate at home because of the keltik Glasgow they know that in the case of a victory and would thus have a better starting point in would have.
The team of Gordon strachan could even at a setback of the frame a defeat suffice in order to qualify, nevertheless, he should not too much trust in such circumstances, because in the case of nine points resembling and is the Ukrainians the participation; the last week in Glasgow had lost (), but during the second play could win ().
Therefore will therefore try, the bulkheads the evening to vermiesen. These hopes, for the second time in consequence of the round of the Milanese to reach after it in the vorrangehenden in exactly the same round by a door of kaka in the nachspielzeit (0) and by a zero to zero draw on the were defeated.
While the up on the victory of the ", the team will have to concentrate on its own game, since both reaching the and its membership at the UEFA of his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.

New fears about between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price argument between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.

A former conflict between the two states in the last year of reduced supplies in the European Union states.
The recent controversy between Kiev and Moscow happened at a time, to which the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State Gazprom attempt to reach an agreement by means of how much the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008 must pay.
According to the Gazprom more must be charged to the Ukraine, since the group has agreed up to 50% for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan to pay.
Say that this could mean that the Ukraine 40% more for the imports of Gazprom must pay.
It is important for us to our arguments as one of the most important in the case of discussions to use ", the Minister of economics of the Ukraine the Reuters news agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly with our arguments concerning the amount of the transit charges [to] Western Europe over the Ukraine.
In the last great between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 cut Gazprom supplies in the Ukraine.
This led to a case in consequence of the exports to Western Europe, which pushed up the prices drastically.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, however much it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.

Saudi Arabia has uncovered yesterday that it is 208 militant cells arrested because of their belonging to an imminent attack on a plant as well as on priests and security forces had planned.
The national television of the world's biggest exporter said that one of the cells would have planned rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have a campaign against the monarchy, which since 2003, an ally of the United States, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militant mentioned by a foreign citizens, an attack on a plant in the eastern province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has a man strong rapid intervention troop an unsuccessful Al quaida-anschlag on the world's largest oil in abqaiq in 2006 to protect.
The report, with reference to a innenministerliche declaration says that 18 of arresting belonged to a cell of a ", the" conducted was illegally into the country.
It reports that the militant would have planned eight projectiles in the Kingdom.
Further 22 of the prisoners planned according to the report, to kill priests and security forces.
The religious government has more to do in order to stop Saudis strive for Iraq in order with Al-Qaeda militias who the allied forces and the Shiite Muslim government want to fight the of the under the Sunni Saudis regarded as heretical.

The climate on Venus, a view of the future of the earth reveal
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data on an orbit supply European show that the planet Earth still a twin resembles more aware than up to now.
The Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary the earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however, the Venus the sun is somewhat closer.
Before billion of years had there been conditions on Venus, very similar to those on earth would have been and could have been even inhabitable scientists believe today.
However, because of the carbon dioxide, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower suggested Venus, a quite different one.
Today the planet of water robbed and has a surface temperature, which is enough, lead to melt and by and flash storms devastated.
The findings of the space probe Venus express the European Space Agency travel for a year examined, offer a view of how the earth, in view of the disastrous climate changes could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of physics the Oxford University, one of the director of the Venus express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus so different to that of the earth, while the planet rather similar otherwise."
"our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus before billion of years as the earth has started, possibly with an environment."
"enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was yesterday by the Slovak police and Hungarian confiscated.
A speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material is examined.
He did not, whether it is a question of enriched uranium, but said that for 1 million dollars (480.000 pounds) sold could.
Everything still open
Memo romey said that he considers it is not worthy of a presidential candidate, from a to be consulted.
In spite of this, the Republican candidate for the Presidency in the long run to a debate on to face in the ordinary voters ask video questions and submit it to the candidates to send.
None of the questions on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the Democrats about the global warming in the debate of the other party.
However, the questions and answers reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which bursts in the elections next year.
It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.
However, in the first half hour of debate, the longest was dedicated to a single topic was immigration in the heart.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of manipulate voters to operate a if they heard things which they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and romney, the crucial inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it is flexible with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked romney in it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.
The two stopped especially hard as questioners asked whether one of the candidates, a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way in which citizenship would give) would support.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in the case of this topic.
Neither of the two men has serious chances in the case of the nomination, but both of them remain in running, perhaps because they use and harder than other on which have hit.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.
This subject, together with fears about toxic toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, to help the Republicans, the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize.
But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported in the past.
John McCain and romney discussed this, whether in regard should be regarded as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This led to the point of view that Giuliani, that although the Bible preferential book, be it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further questioners asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in the first place, in a recent survey carried out in this one, owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pushed Jesus, whether they would approve it and it was said Jesus to intelligent in order to apply a political office.
Running remains extremely wide open.
Huckabees rise in falls together with Paul's recent and its in the debate by Wednesday.
These two are from anything, because the two wings of the party has still not on one of the better known and more traditional candidates were able to agree.
In the year 2000, a candidate in 1980 and the party from the outset and convincing reconciled with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party.
The party is split this time, and the result is not at all clear.
The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles seem to have been sold politician Paris paid hotel bills toes, not to have been.
But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people disguised and that the party failed to announce this is something without which the disputed Gordon Brown well would have managed.
When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting when he said that public opinion polls, this decision would not have affected, there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as vince, the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed the brown feared once of Stalin bean developed.
The clumsy rescue of northern rock, a hit Bank weakness and bad discernment judgement under fire.
Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative.
A trio of generals in retirement started a revolt in protest against the Upper House of military: to be Secretary of the armed forces, so you have claimed a partial.
Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams; Peter this labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) has already resigned.
This means that brown breaks the direction of open.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point, after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People still being allowed to trust politicians, but do they usually back their scepticism, if a new force takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and it does not even need to be long, this delay is past: the public service starts to become leaky; the cabinet ministers begin to; the press looks for bad news; and the government is defensive and secretaries.
In a way, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because he, in contrast to other political leaders cannot claim to be a new broom.
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny that it was his.
The problems with northern rock and which, for example, hang together with decisions, the brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if not directly involved in the misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" of a political party financing, the voters assume possibly, that he was it.
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As in the case of bean, nobody died or completely.
And the remedy, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public, says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill.
That may be so, but perhaps the decision it wasn't entitled to it.
The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those who govern the country.
This says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not the fact that it is illegal, will of course have to put some questions; just as labours main finance which over the separate contributions in October were told.
But so far brown not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew about this confusion, although the largest part of the payments after taking office in June was made.
So far the Prime Minister finished half of the work.
He has quickly the violation of the law by his party, but he diluted this determination by reaching after a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led, in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this instance, the "it to be pulled out" not very complicated.
If the law were broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown must, as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life, to find the vacant for six months, and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing.
This would require the labour of the hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions which - bitter pills for a party Member, as Mr Brown.
But it should be conscious of some partial facts.
The Conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion polls; it has two years to recover voters; and the only way it can reach a victory, is through indisputable and Sturdy competence.

British baenker plead guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, for their role in the fraudulent system with the former main of Enron, Andrew before the Court should be placed on Wednesday, changed their requests in communication.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew had originally for seven cases of fraud by use of for the alleged with fastow in a secret finance fraud in the year 2000 in order at the expense of their employer, pleads on innocent.
The procedure had been applied for the January.
However, during a hearing before the Court in front of Ewing junior everyone pleaded for a case of fraud by use of communication.
The three former managers of Greenwich natwest, a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland group plc, were in Great Britain in the course of procedures, which lasted for two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation, which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against them in the year 2002 fastow drew attention to the fact that it was the objective of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "three" - that they are in the year 2000 to Houston around a fraudulent conspiracy with fastow and its former Michael kopper hatch.
Greenwich natwest had a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron invested, controlled by fastow was the architect of innumerable fraudulent machinations which contributed to tear the company in bankruptcy-wobble.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank of the value of their participation in the subsidiary on zero appreciated, however, the three British men knew that it had considerable value in reality.
A company under koppers control acquired the parts of the Bank of the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid kopper 250,000 dollars for involvement in this enterprise.
According to the accusation, wrongly in comparison with Enron, that the energy companies 20 million dollars natwest for their parts of the subsidiary would pay.
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while fastow, kopper and others about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges.
In January 2004, declared itself in two charges on conspiracy for its role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow serves a term of imprisonment in the of Louisiana.
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and one month in a mechanism in texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollars bail, which made it necessary, that it is in the United States lived in expectation of the legal proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest enterprise in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of tricks do not longer debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable business.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth lay and the former one executive Jeffrey skilling last year for their roles in connection with the collapse.
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were futile, after he died because of heart disease last year.

Soon, there was a.
And then there was a further.

England confronted with decision about the statements of owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the others.
Who is as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah or ravi,?
And not less relevant in a broader context than the first test to Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because the David youthful, on call at least under this specific title, is here, about the Peter bog and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide, and because of the table of high morries, the English managing director, gradually, with applications for national fills, if not even for what in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate, but that life is often unfair and sport, it is beyond doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being made it possible to reach the point of his profession, while someone else about the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of capability.
It is not only necessary in, where the choice is difficult, where judgments which are always at the end of subjective.
Is it the right time for, gross?
It is fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can perhaps also in a wider area be asked whether, for example, John Edward "or", both intelligent young with good conclusions, the business well knows, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a one-day, unless it the possibility given to sink or swim.
Of course numbers have a big influence on decisions, but are also have this.
Within a team must a one-day the eye of the captain at the right time catch, if it can take a and a bat must regular opportunities on the right, if it wants to do impression as a one-day.
The eyes of the to catch is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson were apparent in the first test will play, even if Stephen pronounces itself for healthy and as the wind in the networks.
Anderson included 32 Prime wickets per 33 to earn a position in this route.
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points and hope to still more.
Whether Shah or, in the asgiriya stage is, can only be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps, however, it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in each test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and useful to 40, it was, however, Paul, then still fightingly in order to consolidate the breakthrough to a significant testkricketspieler created and, although it is a double one hundred against in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.
It is probable that youthful Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of the present in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and's greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against bullets.
However, Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in May against the West in the test in Lord, its as a player from middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the as Vaughan was well, about his position for the next game, seems to take back the momentum from its suggest to have taken the still in Bombay was obvious.
In contrast, the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex.
It is of no one impressed and its attitude off this was taken to the point when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.
He suffered from smaller injuries and probably a shock, but first, which he did was to be Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and its Cook ask who had observed this from the distance and with enthusiasm to say: "have you seen this?".
, is a much better, be it with some effect here on the grounds, which seems to match it and, with confidence and destiny.
The right man to select a thing is the right time to choose a different.
Perhaps that is the art of the real choice.
In addition, I incline its chance now to give, which does not mean that maybe Shah well sentence is not, however, if, as the from Ceylon suggests, it is that, will play here this weekend.
Buses return refugees back to work and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of refugees, the funds or visas ran out, and others, who hoped that the city of returns to normality.
Some even had returned to fight the rebels, the them from their homes.
Busily still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official from a dozen bus was the terminals active with refugees from Syria and Jordan had returned in private.
"I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad, said al-qubaisi Sabah, a doctor.
"I returned today, because what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspaper about what has happened in Baghdad and as it now would be safe.
They say that of stopped killing people ", he said, in terms of the Shiite of militant clergyman addr, arranged its forces at the present time to put back.
Qassim Al atwani, a 38-year old Shi'ite teachers from the overwhelming Sunni part of returned with his two children, because he was not able to renew its visa and because the Iraqi regime is not permitted to work.
His Shiite neighbours in amariyah called it, in order to say to him that a local, supported by the USA militia helped Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and having to expel him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni, Shia, from its house in sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with grenades, after it had been sold its fellow citizens for combatting had requested.
He returns in order to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they all the militia in sleikh themselves and that it my support and that of my young need it.
That is why I returned today ", said, 62.
Many told that it through the increasing peace in the capital, since the and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", which had been lured arms and in cooperation with the American military their boroughs.
But more spoke, home by visa problems and resources in up to have been forced, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in the last few years.
Salaam al-samarrai, a 51-jaehriger father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Shiite Prime Minister, the Syrian Government had asked to impose restrictions for the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably one of the sectarian death in fled the country.
"We were well to Syria, and the Government pressed the Iraqis, no more visas to give them to return to Iraq to force" said the Sunni pensioners.
"I cannot trust a government, which supports the criminals, the House burned down, after I went away."
A part of the reason for the fall in force that Sunni, Shia from residential areas and vice versa were expelled, which led to the creation of many places where tensions diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees tensions will stir up again and it will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading at the vocational training and shine even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in the education field the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I have 'yesterday to the 50th time, that we are not French, the smallest federal state placards this slogan to its 50th birthday.

Even the possibilities of vocational and academic training are comparatively fully developed.
On the total population, the equipment with dual courses which is based in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of in the last few years has dropped by a third, however.
Therefore the education department which universities now to a marketing campaign for fan.
"at the general schools, we have a number of reforms of the first PISA study after study" says a speaker of the Ministry.
So the Government introduced comparison tests.
So that the children to learn to use to begin the last kita year free of charge, a model which in the meantime also other States copy.
Whether the achievements of the student better themselves will show, only future comparative studies.
In the case of PISA 2003, the share of the risk of 29 on 20 per cent.
In total Saarland did not however increase as strongly as other States.
Bavaria expect better.
And for the annoyance at the are not measured - in this area, one could otherwise points.

If the clocks?
In Venezuela, the clocks soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the in the American country by half an hour turned back.
In Spain, will be like in the meantime a joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela informed, according to a new law the clocks on the universal minus four and a half hours.
In this way the südamerikansiche State gets a time zone which it in any other country in the world.
The Chávez justified its decision in this way, among other things, that the United States in the world, the division into time zones to full hours imposed.

With the reform, he would considerably improve its power in the country.
Release of the argument was the decision to extract, like the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia to escape, during which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe Venezuela with its decision in the face, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain is like the talk of the town.

German threatens 2007
Despite the strong economy threatens German workers according to a prognosis of this year.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the employees could really hans-böckler-donation 2007 with less on that account than in the previous year.
"are to blame the modest wage development, the tax increase and the with food and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for market research and of the "picture of" newspaper.

Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus, despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth, as so far more similar thought: the European space probe "Venus express" has theory into the atmosphere and Poland's, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades assume scientists, that it is on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - they sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the theory on the Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" theory that life on earth develop: thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the elements of life.
Not so on Venus: "if it ever life over there, it must have been in the very early history", explain Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today, it is on the surface of the Venus little live: the atmosphere is approximately one hundred times more closely than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus, is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size is so similar to an entirely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, because, since the beginning of the nineties not probe more specifically to the study of this planet was on the way.
The latest research results now in several "nature" are introduced, emphasize according to the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"they also show that the parallel our with the earth are greater than at first assumed, communicate the ESA.
So the researchers found in addition to the already well-known whirlwind at the North Pole, also a at still much faster.
This phenomenon reminds air on the earthly writes a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto by Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost exactly the same size.
Also as tomorrow or described planet circles in just 225 days around the sun.
It concerns, but much more slowly themselves: a takes 243 earth.
Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly the earth, scientists assume that both planet under very similar conditions developed.
On both water which remained on the earth in oceans, on Venus, but in the area was lost.
And while carbon dioxide on earth in carbonate rocks, makes it on Venus, the majority of the atmosphere.

In the realm of Angela cloud
The unrealistic appearance of the documents that the coalition document at the end - and that of her nothing more is to be expected.
In what country does this Chancellor actually?
According to their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag and meaningless was, one must say: not here - not in the country, which must finally be ruled over by it.
The accusation that they too much on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel, with a terribly arrogant sentence rejected.
This is provincial, she said and showed that only that it does not want to understand, for it is a matter for the critics.
In the Bundestag they recognizable for all documents, such as the reproach is very correct.

The example climate protection: since it praises without brakes for the decisions of Saint dam, say, but not, as this country climatic goals are to be achieved.
Anyway, that so much immodesty would have the presumptuousness still two years ago.
Now it is the empty phrase that the lift arrives at the people.
In this way it damages its image as a pragmatist, solve the problems, instead of talking the world beautifully.
However, in the realm of Angela cloud domestic problems an edge appearance.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners?
She has a couple of clauses for.
It is characteristic, as it often mistake when it is a question of the matter.
Three approaches Merkel needs there in order to bring out a straight sentence.
They stumbles as on foreign land if it actually is.

And sometimes it makes a mistake to conventional piece of music.
This seems then also the gentlemen itself largely to disturb.
The fact that the volume again has under the enthusiasts for some bother guaranteed.
In which one may reveal here: specific demands showed that the name is through the collective, but by no means so themselves to this band for 32 years painfully to miss.
But why should not also the German its existing legends from the celebrated seventy years?
Especially since what misleading called in England and America was always more than in its own country.

In the case of concerts Michael later with the red hot PEPPER on the stage as an old pal.
The problem of the ignorance at home and abroad, in the third is one.
The memory is already overtaxed with, because the trio existed only two years and this time even a far lower unfolded as allocated to them subsequently by others.
Möbius and solo had with the artist Conrad instruments already previously under the promising name cluster.

Then came the desire to force and occasionally practice.

Richard is simply not cynically enough
With "the party" and "dreadful peace" two films deal again with Balkan war.
But both do not.
Either the drafts put too much on action and geballer or else they are to blessed.
There also Richard in "the party did not help.
The good news first: did not hide the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of, is now the actors Richard been found again.
We had the most beautiful man of the years finally lost sight of, because too many roles in for women and too many press conferences on the subject films, the desire to well.
Richard is suddenly the most important argument, "the party - if the hunter to gejagten is" (why, today, really must always be so long and as?), perhaps, but to look at.
It provides a perfect representation: in fact taken its Simon, which could have become from, if the destiny and the not so reporter who would be: a man, its very best times long behind itself, however, even as a monument its fall still considerable remains of the former themselves.
But in spite of this, "the party", together with the German production "dreadful peace", which also starts in this week, only the endless series of failed continues.
"dreadful peace" one can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), a Kosovo from save on the one this also falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that here is not the root of all evil Serbs as exclusive are represented, loses the film too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for 11" without motorway but for with war.
On the other hand, can be on "the party" almost exemplary, why it did not actually ever a correct good has given.
The history of three, which set out by the Serbian "," the fox to trace criminal with another director and another (both in scriptwriter Richard shepard) to another time perhaps a new "now".
Because the stories are alike yes: go both male small teams in the forest, in order to achieve something which the soldiers not able and both times it becomes a journey in the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the party", Simon that one is not simply the shabby cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must it in addition still a romantic affair, with a later murdered Muslim.
Finally, "the party" go then the brook down if the reporters within the last five minutes succeed in the CIA which NATO, and all of the world in five years: the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge left.
This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like.
The film has a deeply human concerns.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects, the Americans and the French (here they should agree for once) due to the pursuit of secret political arrangements too intensively to operate.
But this well and the bad are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense.
It is called it over the wood an Asian demon on the workbench of the poet: "sympathetically I see the swollen: how hard it is to be bad".
Films as "the party" exactly such swelling heads, however, indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited.
Recently in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films were large flops.
One can also add: there has never been a good.
Nearly always applies: if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world, then something like this out as "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette "beyond all borders" with "or" blood diamonds with Leonardo dicaprio.
All the conflicts are possibly temporary simply still to close.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list of" a good film about the Holocaust could turn.
Some film will probably still mature - which now as a classic geltenden "the", "now" or "author" full jacket are really not unanimously been celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today, where everyone mass murder in real time on the same two screens amounts at home also simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that robs the of the, which needs to tell good stories.
"existence or" or "of the great dictator" are, after all, therefore, as well as well, because lubitsch and Chaplin do not yet know how badly the regime really prevailed.
Perhaps one may not want to be good if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps the artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk.
As to parallels between its historical novel "lemprières dictionary" and Balkan war was questioned, he answered: "that is only because some things never change.
Cities are always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always will be war in Yugoslavia.
Of criticism for Olympia refusal harvests
Moving the mayor of the application of Olympic summer games with politics and economics intense criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
But of realism reminds on during the assessment of the chances.
The Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce, Hamburg, Hans described on Wednesday a renouncement is not good for the location ".
No other project has in recent times as great in the city as the Olympic idea.
"without this objective would be the momentum not equally can be maintained.
Schmidt-trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach for ", the basis of a modified".
Ole Mayor of remained on Wednesday at earlier statements that at least until the year 2028 are unrealistic.
"Hamburg does not decide on one, but the German Olympic sports federation", said world online.
He referred to the expected for at the beginning of the decision of the Munich over an application for the winter games 2018.
"this preference is for us that we have in the period up to now thought by us any realistic chance."
Nevertheless, the dream is not for all time, said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (hsb) regretted the statements of beusts.
Thus the impression that Hamburg in the next 25 years, no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games.
It is too early to obstruct a chance for himself, by using the plans already at this time of President said ", Günter ploß on Wednesday.
Moreover, a renunciation of the application in contradiction to the statement of the occasion for a general assembly of the German.
There the application of the 2015, not as a replacement "for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College had only in the past week applicant City Hall as nominated.
The SPD citizens faction reproached the Senate, valuable time for the House building in Hamburg to have used.
"the development of small grasbrooks was delayed by the Senate for years, because he put Olympia on the card and the House building excluded", said the SPD Carola veit and Jan.
While the SPD for the small always an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use, the CDU on one side on the ",".
The application for the 2012 Olympic summer games had initiated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hall had failed because of Leipzig, though.
These are not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wood thinks Ikea but not Andy in.
Or anyway?
At present, raise in Sweden dark shadow on warhols.
A large part of the listed there by the "Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper expresses some months ago about the authenticity of Andy warhols of the yearly 1968 stirred up internal investigations come in, in Stockholm now to a result: the six "boxes", the former of which the Museum in 1995 as has bequeathed are copies - and probably the majority of another about one hundred of the "Stockholm, on the international art market in circulation.

It was not a question of works of art, but the examples in order to bare exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968 probably the permission of a few brillo wooden produced in Sweden to make, though not in, were issued.
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about fifteen boxes, which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the name "Stockholm" to right in the auction and history.
Some of them have on auctions, more than 100 000 dollar.
The problem is now that of the legendary of museum later falsely claimed, it 1968 approximately one hundred in Sweden was produced and issued him then left.
In fact, 105 boxes before 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time, was already dead for three years.
Lars bystroem, on the curator, along with the six even three from the Swedish private property, of which two 1968 were made in Stockholm: their chipboards were first and ground after that with a White was applied.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990, on the other hand it betrays that the with a without coat directly on the applied was, moreover, it is not a question of oil, but about color.
"these boxes were not by the artists autorisiert and from the official list of Andy warhols" can be removed, the director of the, Lars announce: "if the 'Andy in kind board' in New York did not come to a different conclusion is that the in the six boxes in its collection as copies / classify."
Already in July certainly the board announced, the "serious accusations" to follow in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised.
However, since there in one remains silent.
