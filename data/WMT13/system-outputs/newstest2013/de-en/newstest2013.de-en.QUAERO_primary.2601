A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center for, the latter is a myth, and that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States,, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the united states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws to make it difficult for the procedures for the registration or.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the period for early voting, the to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to present photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years, to in 34 states, which forced the voters to produce photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to do not unlike Quebec on a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to get the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo id issued by The establishment.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which is On the Republican side, to the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first federal state, who introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college, in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no screening was carried out.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk For men African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that, the aggressive and others, they are indolent.
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer by pointed out the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate cancer, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and will be in this case for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, in which the cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
It is an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and those who do not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be done or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would move enough.
"If there is no more smoking, this would rise at least to 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly damages the health of the people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to have the risk of breast, colon, rectal,,, and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer during the entire life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In, it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Sausages should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
At present, but Their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the possible discovery of the has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that the boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, it is the last of the standard model particle whose existence - our best or the least wrong "explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has been observed, but not predicted by.
But for physicists, it is not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is wrong, because apparently only a small risk to, and let us look at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable law that in this world that can be two objects at the same time, in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state "," and "on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as and the Pauli principles.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "," the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson, which would be.
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, "the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or change the direction of, the electromagnetic field is in this place "disrupted" like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
In this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "of the force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, must be "disrupted" Higgs field, so that the boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be a very large rocks spall.
That is why a giant particle accelerator is - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - In order to achieve the kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not, in fact, all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, a piece of paper would never in the refrigerator.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.
What all this research can be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the to.
There are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even in 1962, the first (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a "laboratory gimmick".
Imagine...
In addition, there are also from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in optics, has developed a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die.
With its Committee on "death With dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate has to be in The near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which it aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, it is not can be prepared," he says.
The disease makes his work: a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees with the help.
He even manages to smile and speak with strangers who are around him, give him his medication, and a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that My diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of.
In return, the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, big events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are by the doctors and nurses who care for them, with a so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89, is the worst fear, to die, "and by suffocation."
But by the disease, I have my children really.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no longer in life," she says, before she accepts that she wears a mask that helps her breathe.
It expects in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance In food intake.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths.
In Quebec, a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little, given that we will all die one day.
The life in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying wishes, according to an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night Mr X, we have a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported by his pillow, while his honor, a young man of 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of and the society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this major shortcomings in the care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with its has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I will break the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it is not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not.
After Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal 8% of patients do not speak to a pain treatment.
At the very end the life of the doctors rely so often terminal sedation, which the patients either sporadically or permanently to the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if We do not perceive this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to the terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I want to see my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research Institute.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, companies in the main building industry, political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system," in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso involved.
"Industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since It has taken drastic measures," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was exposed by on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road in Quebec, which had only reluctantly agreed to the former prime minister.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in the of the Treaties," because some zügelten its instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to case," he adds, in the hope that she "demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, A permanent anti-corruption unit
In 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit and analysts of the with their troops to auditors, the government is also a great effort.
In addition, the police force, "," which since 2009 has ensured that the "" Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained...
In recent weeks, it has made by the house searches and raised allegations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, has resigned.
He is suspected, in exchange for public contracts repeatedly bribes.
In fact, engineers were accused of Montreal, and of Italian origin, as well as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a stir by the Commission has the function of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has for several years of 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal to a the in connection with the Mafia, which It paid for the money to the Union Montreal party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game in the 2000s, more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of parties, especially the Liberals, in power at that time.
He also confessed to illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes to the amount of $736,000 in exchange for contracts, which it.
Other officials of the road Administration have admitted that they were, by the bills artificially with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, Montreal, which is a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As mayor of the district, in the east of the island, they from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
The study will be carried out in the end, she says that "on a thread, which, which makes it possible to understand the function of the system of ants in order to stop the evil and the culprits."
She says that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are about to clean the wound, however, need a certain investigative unit, as well as for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How do you clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen from several hundred million dollars," but above all concerned about the role of the "over the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing in the situation: "as long as the election campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public contracts and the financing of the parties: "we cannot fall deeper; to the things with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau those who laugh about it, to take a look in their own backyard.
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have a new deal with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff gave me a lot.
These factors spur me every day to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football, everything is going very quickly.
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my game time at Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
The new entrants this summer are used to make a very high levels.
They also know that every training session.
This means that a player like me, the forehead and wants to give his best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
It is supported by other such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches In Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The trust that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the us.
We are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the World Cup in this way.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say, a very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the First of our group in Porto, so that we can deliver the return leg of the final home game.
The PSG can become a major European club in the short term?
He has already in the budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financial resources, so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important to us, the of This title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If we win, with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has made huge spending.
In terms of the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of this new PSG were good, "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that you speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is also one of the world's best defenders, allowing everyone to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was to take part in this European championship.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from being able to some game time.
I saw things that I am stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
The forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin payments and selling without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, from bank, leads to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as convertible, a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network has already been about 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment.
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he recovered to about ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "," which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and managed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin are all at the same time, money network nodes repositories of the accounting book, auditors, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to sign this new deal in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add This additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer, "" the new transaction and add a number of before the whole thing "."
The goal is to find the that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre....
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
But also cash these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins in circulation.
In November, a "" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul, Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner managed its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with them, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to an address, photographed and identified by a telephone "can be," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time to Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success of this currency.
We are withdrawing from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have to be punished, in particular, the Afghan farmers by we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 slain soldiers, as well as the injured and.
The Taliban are of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but also often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes backed by the local insurgents, the latter will not be there if the Western countries.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill, which was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly.
The helicopters überflogenen trucks and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At the time Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
At the time of Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the Al qaeda overwhelmed by the farmers, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They have turned into this racket property seized by the government, in order to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting.
They have been discredited, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaign, people want a government that is not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those that American contributions to take advantage of the: the flight of capital.
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties to the corruption of certain executives, they will have to make jobs available.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television with its Turkish series, which is a modern world, everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command they will be seen as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the of the militias in the province, which the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially at the time of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s, and long dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, are and important irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is The priority.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, would have been a state control of the infrastructure needed.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy, in order to process iron or mining is not possible Without the means of transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have left the copper mine of Mes Aynak almost international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site their excavations and remain the major employers in the province.
One day it will be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys in high schools, Institute for French universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, has a service "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which the 2012 has been carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and a small French non-governmental organisation, in order to try to win the "hearts and minds" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and improvement of agricultural land.
We leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are very hard in these valleys often at a height of more than 2000 meters.
In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
The farmers of the rebellion led by foreign groups, which is their desire for their own statements, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and directly relevant civilian aid to their benefit.
A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on its final version, the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to the House.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has a for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president in his "autocratic delirium" is "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters are assured that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to give up their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest raging across the country.
In an interview with the American Wochenschau Time seems to have to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the has not complied with the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have, because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views.
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not.
The text, which was last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stricter application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
According to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, which awards an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.
It is in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will be submitted to Parliament, but a national defence council.
There will be no ban on civil trial in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They say that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president last night had to say on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activist, the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant labor, a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing and retail.
But the tests are to be over time, according to the migration authority for all migrant workers in the future.
It is not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be established for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
There are Also exempt from this law, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The whole of the will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of people, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities; now, have already opened more than 160 such centers were in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the federal immigration authorities.
Civil rights activist, on the whole thing, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press, the following question: what does it actually mean?
What changes to the, language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the migration authority, it is to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
On the problems migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions, which is under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you one thing, and on arrival, you have been cheated In their passports and do not receive the promised wages," the head of the labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
It is not, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, too, that they do not know not only the language of the country, but also in their own language to express in writing.
Of course, that is not so much their fault, but rather the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sound basic education.
In their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills,".
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists say the following important aspect of the law.
The test only migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "forbidden access to banned"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, The linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalisation of costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents and we are not registered, and then to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Spare no expense for false papers."
On the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests, have already been by members of the federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a three thousand rubles.
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates can be bought, both officials and civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, that you get time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills will be offered in areas where no active communication with people.
The Interior ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the law for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the arms law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attraction of the screws."
An open letter published on the Internet, the author - representatives of various armed groups - are the authorities of "senseless."
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from it, to serve on the black market.
At present, you can, according to the authors of in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to officers
The weapons through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who was ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves," says.
On the second channel illegal weapons, the are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these weapons that were stolen from both the of the police and by employees of the law enforcement authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
In many military camps were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
According to make a contribution to the black market in the arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private arms factories, which do not stand up to the international competition and therefore the weapons on the black market,, in Moscow, does not," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, organized smuggling," says the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report by the center for analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the federal service for National statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the "guilt by the work of with weapons," the report.
The data, according to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser of a gun shop, which does not want to be named, assured that weapons for a long time, no one is buying weapons found in illegal excavations, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders get supplies in a military camp.
A Ensign is a weapon, for example, a pistol from the TT type bought.
The weapon will be issued and pass through the fence.
"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know, of course about everything, if it can not comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodically purchases by offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As in the luxury store"
Most of Buyers and sellers find each other.
I have seen websites and blogs, as someone who has been to me, and I suggested to the station, "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, I would bring in a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a friend, who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go and with a code as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, who is that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I come to some shot rings on a friend whom I trust.
It gives me the rings just because he knows that I do not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez tried in the as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The has not changed according to him.
He got a photo album, in which "everything possible" was.
"I felt like the luxury store," recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets, according to a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I do not buy a potential customer, but with the seller in the forest, and that is where we are a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," the expert describes the action.
From your couch
Internet search engine results show to Web pages and groups in "Vkontakte, where weapons are available for different purposes."
It will not require any papers, there are personal meetings.
"You only need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "pistol or rifle."
There is your orders and.
Also to be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security service, recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire the weapons abound, the service into the net.
The people are like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in Siberia and coal must stop money
Military commentator and former soldiers, Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following way: the site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The orders.
The buyer transfers The money.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the of the weapon," the spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that at the end, and can be behind bars, if you have a question on a web page.
The Federal Security service, recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire the weapons abound, the service into the net.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and must stop pouring money into coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
With the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US dollars.
"You can buy a gun, According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization" Pravo na oryzhie type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military weapons camps of.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes of illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
In the US fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four American adolescents when behind the cash register of Mc Donald's
In the past few days, there have been the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to, or whether they are out of the again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase In the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday in the United States took place, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with people of low and.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees on the work.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can sell the goods are often so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of serious conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now pay.
If Walmart, the wage increases would pass on to customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
They compared to this would be a year for additional spending of just 12.39 dollars.
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it was only in nine states to protests and no losses to the company.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the on "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that a "less than five" Walmart employees work, and the protest is only "another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where their does not, however, Walmart stores (which are not in this progressive city, and that is why so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York legislation 7.25 dollars an hour.
The minimum wage will be increased gradually in fast food restaurants, but not too much, and on average, get their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's, people who complain that they have to feed this wage and sometimes even their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you didn't know how to eat.
The participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits the to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
The protests on this day, there were many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including city Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast food workers so that they can achieve a fair wage and economic prosperity every New Yorker!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, which is far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the work in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass.
"The brain can be so far only moderately"
The issue of the enlarged reality is perceived by supporters of modern technologies in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer, a working model in November, it was announced that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a staging post.
The ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe your, which operates research group.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is in the period, which works with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes affected.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years, and the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and today is no Xbox sold without, because everyone interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet.
We are trying to change the work on real three-dimensional display systems based on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We have to lay off the computer world in our physical world and make them more.
To this end, it is important that not only the user, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world much easier to virtual objects.
And the first and foremost, we should be of virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice?
It is popular, but It will not be overrated?
- It is certainly not the solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because they do not like to inform all others about its actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, with sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but in theory, could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to, for example, gestures and language.
- Like that?
For example, We would ask me to reach out to you this?
They say it and, at the same time.
- Normally, I will say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- That you want the user adapt to what can be a machine at the time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the near future, in particular on the development of new types of sensors, which make it possible to the people.
The laser sensors, for example, could be because they are in the depth of a good resolution, which is very important.
- What do you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would not be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
So all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes in our lab in Redmond, developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much it affects the interaction between man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device, only without the control and with more images per second.
- Would not be increased the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem.
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice, to a flexible, system in which we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always on the way to keep a smartphone in your hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a "temporary" augmented reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The lens is a personal and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects.
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
There is a problem that critics often point out of this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all.
What answers to give your group at this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough In the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as somewhat unusual projection.
It takes pressure!
But there are also technologies that are on the "pictures in the air" to give something, for example, the interference of some ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but that is still so weak as someone on the.
There are also bands for the wrist, on the nerve endings in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
We think that it can feel what it should feel if it sees something?
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here is another challenge facing us that we will have to fight for a long time, is that people who are physically in a closed room to believe,, it is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in the), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only moderately, and we still have many busy years of work.
It is that makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: in many issues, we are only at the beginning.
My own taste of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the list already landed high-ranking representatives of the art scene, whose successes beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden,, or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are always issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artist, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the streets and a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens with them for a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of its, its philosophy and its image finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and turquoise or yellow, for example, in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society of, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want my provocations with the people.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you have to become a painter?
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work.
I realised that I have to go down this path.
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I am with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was a "Pushkinskaya 10," and then once was.
It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music, to everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the culture, where the best creative artists should meet.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation a club for the Boheme, the house of the.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and was one of the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group began to play live, was from the "Leningrad".
Mountain moderated many programs before the era of "Halli Galli."
We gave them, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the hospital.
Our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press, "people of our city."
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and so I had arrived at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
Clowns are timeless.
I was socially, but now it hurts and is to be so.
In a clown obliterated everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by stipulating that everyone has to dress up.
Now everyone is the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but he should spit in the face.
The deception disappears through The.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Large groups of people In the past: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
Now you have to think about whom you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
- Women abandoned him, the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I have painted these pictures, which hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- What is missing Kirill Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars did not a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts is that the former correctly assess and pave the way for them.
Now, only their own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums.
- What is for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural Capital in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art is difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Born in space
Earth at risk.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with Erdbewohnern on board to the search for a replacement.
In order to save the human race, the important question is, how we can reproduce In the, or on the planet?
There are many choices, in my opinion.
De facto, there are only two real planet, which we could at least hypothetically.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
But, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life, on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers first in relation to the flora.
Half a century before experiments with plants have already been carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas bred in orbit, not all of the species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila) in orbit.
In the year 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how microgravity affects the development of embryos.
It is becoming a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," said the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface over the.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later she died.
"We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, But on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that have already been fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"That was with the Biosatelliten, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research should be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats.
Could not solve The issue of reproduction in space so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped from their natural habitat, can not follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly for 50 years.
It was The biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most precious, humanity is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight?
After this flight, Will be able to bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered the question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of The child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also.
In 1988 to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even work outside of the, a son.
However, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the human race for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The laboratory in the preparation of the cosmonaut is a mandatory station during the flight.
Here in limbo, the cosmonauts routine for work in the open space.
The water is The weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a, it is a foreign environment, but babies water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to the fact that the life of the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
As for a newborn child, the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of the and pelvic muscles, and the ability to extract the child.
Well, we deal with.
The birth, for example, could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child.
"But what happens then?" Is the not insignificant matter of.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the gravitational pull of the organism can not train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a suit.
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which will bring together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely people to the world," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe theory.
At some point, but it will become reality if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in the.
Chief: control of the black system failed due to the fault of politics
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts good bodies and adequate laws, but falls in their application.
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the board of control (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case," said Kala, the current situation.
A similar result is A common control by Czech and German.
He has the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas example As a bad practice, the so-called "black system."
The Prime Minister said Recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls, the system is prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government simply cannot come, and the control Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work," Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a common Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other on public contracts.
What did it?
It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts. The national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and although the review is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more detailed rules. You have to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you help? What is for you from this project?
It is precisely such a joint control could help us that we stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance thresholds, if this does not seem particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be the case that the system in this way only with excessive paperwork "," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
As far as the authorities, the German equivalent to the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which is only slightly different. In principle, but authorities both the same.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is this in the individual states - in the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in our state funds.
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the courts.
As far As the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this reluctant without specific details. However, in some ways, Germany is often described as a model, but you cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
That is because the auditors are better?
That is not, but as I don't particularly like, such comparisons.
It should be noted that even those countries which are a model for us, also have to contend with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, Or?
With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority, the revision of the law you feel any impact?
Given that this is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests so far.
After the our controls, you have to rely on a certain delay.
We feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes will have an impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions have been modified for certain types of of.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be charged with more bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules will be "tougher" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are, in a way to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable that any breach of the law is a violation of budgetary discipline.
But it is to make the law more stringent?
I do not believe that in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have, which made a formal does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say first of all, what is not.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with control of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
The system is now banned or allowed?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government simply cannot come, and the control Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work.
He can say: "we change the law and allow the thing," but He cannot say that we do so, as if nothing would be.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded because of procedural.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing in my opinion.
There is On the streets, but they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic is part of snow and ice.
The streets are good, but every now and then, is passable, increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were passable well this morning, there was snow and ice.
The Temperatures fell to -5 to -10 ° C, it should be a little warmer during the day.
In the region, it is snow, and in the lower elevations is only a thin blanket of snow.
On the mountain of the Ore Mountains, about 30 cm of snow.
According to the due to fog limited visibility.
The R6 and the roads of the first class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, for example, attention is on bridges, where the streets are sometimes icy and slippery.
The second and third class roads are passable roads, including the mountain roads.
On these roads, however, remain frozen or snow remains.
Especially in the higher elevations is.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets Ostböhmens risk because of Eisglätte in higher elevations and in the mountains, there is a ausgefahrene snow layer is on the streets, the road and highway management on their websites.
The Straßenmeistereien warn drivers that can occur, especially in higher elevations in The district of Pardubice.

Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy gain
What do you think about it, that is to take place in less than a month of the world?
This is one of those, which we humans are so keen to start.
With our band the Tap Tap we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy in order to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you also have a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project to our readers?
It is a national fundraising event, which we have been planning two years ago.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is projected for 21 December at 11: 10 am in the end of the.
The day before, that is, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
Who is from this idea?
Originally from me, then we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we would not only to collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public about the state of the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the world, with its purchase of can also support the people.
The band the Tap Tap has, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the world, with the title "of the world."
The anthem is very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works and the end Of the world does not take place.
The anthem should be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are in a direct circuit broadcast live by Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is to the fact that We realize many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to integrate these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperating with us, and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts at the end of the world?
For the establishment of the education center Studeo, in which we are already six years with the club in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of The Jedlička Institute are cared for by editors who help them with different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is intended to create a separate building in which we with this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
What criteria do you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
We also want to be like Next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, many instruments suitcase and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, SA and British Airways were always been very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised sometimes.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By your foreign travel you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as there are people with disabilities, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were in Russia, that is still in its early days in the East.
In Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not obvious that It is in a wheelchair user, for example, of course, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we are...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space, go to the museum, you can use toilets etc.
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social activities, we are with the band the Tap Tap the West a little ahead.
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only one of our ranks meaning athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what motivated in 1998 to create a band?
I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were interested in dealing with.
And since I am a musician And saxophone playing, among other things, along with a colleague, I have a music AG.
Oh, and at the time, as our, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band became known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have also started to advertise for us.
We are aware that if you are and that it is not to the outside world, its own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also be good editors, and quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get there with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do things differently.
In the show business often copied to the other.
This is logical in its own way, as new with caution and will be accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
The first impression that The audience is, of course, it is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would have to regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, not just for them, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people?
If you want to make something good, there is no compromises on many things, and also need to a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they that they have twice a week, prepared phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
How it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go, That you can prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the end of the world, predicted Thursday on the 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are at the end, and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "of the world," the Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional accessible education center that under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. The price: CZK 25 million.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free tickets are available in advance.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was as a member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War Polish space in the space, and they do not always met with understanding.
I would remind you of the lecture by A. Šternfeld 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, for example, in which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905), the audience cold, and after years ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been by, among other things, that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In the year 1925 in Poland, a railway trolley was built, a rocket was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with.
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear From the documents show that the research was to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work by his work was the beginning of the war.
Another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four major articles devoted to the space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains The proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its inception in 1956, the PTA Polish aerospace company founded in 1951 to join the International Federation for space, and indeed, in the autumn of 1956, the PTA was already.
In the following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
The office he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and 1959 in the bledowska desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, but the development has been.
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and The weight was 32.5 kg.
This has developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at a height of about 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, after two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court of the law on charitable work.
That decision in a lively discussion in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, free movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper goods in economic competition, "in order to grab a larger market share by the competition" and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Private capital is no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the government spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that, the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are here.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are for several years, public food distribution for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people who are already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed in the.
The austerity measures of practically all eu southern states will be on the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here is the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam, that the state should not be capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster.
The private capital is on his position that the state should not interfere with in the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the policy, and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual unmistakably, practically everything in the legislation, but nothing is punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department for lack of finance private, dense with industry of with the development of law.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is no longer from the people, as the western nations, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been in a situation that the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and ': "the state has long been in decay, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown, and the people with already bought votes went to the polls... "" people with character not applied for as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul... "" you really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man... "Appian thought to be elected, but the strong man was, democracy permanently replaced by the.
As it turns out, today's society is based, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, the of these regimes can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
The is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution, at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... nothing comes from violence, or ever could," sings the Sting song fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"When my sons no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a host of reactions.
There are those who stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians call them as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the state of Israel, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I would like to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing someone who is guilty and who have not been At the end of the people of Israel, including the areas in the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence.
It is the of the readers behind the scenes of the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in small parcels of land in the Middle East in particular is to who.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from out of my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really were themselves, independently of their steps, or whether someone was behind her throne, who drew their actions on a goal.
We must admit that we live in an era in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomical rich families particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know if someone above them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
It is understandable.
The first press agency (Reuters) was the Rothschilds in the 1990s, in order to prevent the combination of its name with in the context of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, with in the meantime, the central bank of the of Russia's government has).
Anyone who has tried to counter this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds, bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Pik, a of the and the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the big royalist states to the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and its luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the apron) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order chao - order out of chaos.
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises such as the them in the year 1907 do not repeat).
After they were by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian empire, the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European power.
In order to be able to the Second World war, the bankers by the policy a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations, they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so they had to keep palming the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the culprits, and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column, and also in order to of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as its capital, as the historic area (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler, the chain, which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the World community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and was, as well as by the War reparations against Germany, preparing the ground for the Second World War II, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, is similar to the Jewish people World war II to the victims in the front line of battle, this time, along with the Arab and Muslim population in the of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who was the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice is only in an endless spiral of violence, as at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is important to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, the, is a typical example of a, international bankers loyal dedicated politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, which, in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could come into a global conflict, and that, because of the Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies could lead to the deterioration of the world economy.
In the light of the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "the only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn baby at the birth of a chip implanted, in order to the essence of total control.
"And it is that the kids and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants, a all to their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, because the malt, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who is, who consider the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-six. "
The film Argo: if it is The worst, Hollywood call
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating occupied Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled for their release after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American government, there has been no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by of the hostages made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home, a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States of a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helped them an extravagant story its true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
The combination of genres
, "Tony Mendez, developed by the experts for" Exfiltration plan also made Hollywood's cooperation.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film, the Stimmungs levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the table, at the, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is a remarkable restarting his career with this film.
From a spokesmen ridiculed actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, the thriller No (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in Boston by the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films from the director of the Hollywood standard.
Affleck is this sense, but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played."
The best scenes of the film in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when the story.
A similar effect Affleck and his team also fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in Too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
But it has been working With the little, and sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, some of the).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their characters but deserved more space, and that they are not in the film by far from alone.
Afflecks film it loses a little traction. It is a movie that, with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the age of 70, retro style.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a living piece of history, in some way, and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough.
Guidelines for the balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, this year, has decided to hold the "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are objectively less of a risk for the insurance companies.
"More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol belongs to fuel, which is in its aftermath, the ban on the mercury thermometer, just because they a relatively small amount of this, or the directive on size of chicken cages, because of the eggs this year were much more expensive.
The criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm
The EU machine, often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels (Czech Republic is currently trying example, to do with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind it, that bananas of the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and no "of."
The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which according to balloons in the sale must be with that children under eight years of the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, which are in accordance with balloons in the is the leading cause of children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU,, which use the name Macedonia, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez faire nominated in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, in the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the EU membership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded The volume of canned mushrooms, for which threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them that they do not have a sea, or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will be asking for a refund from the EU, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
The argument that the grain harvest was very high, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps.
The Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically for the establishment of aid money should be funding requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
The target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition in the member States.
A serious problem, according to these experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in with the deepening of European integration, which were in the budget negotiations by individual member states.
Emotions that the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win in this country.
The Czech Republic could to after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the local rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us in the 19th century, but had to change our manufacturers, "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the company of the feta cheese, Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits, carp from Pohořelice and and now, or even the Žatec hops.
With an can boast the gingerbread or Hořicer roles.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the office of the president?
It is not for me to be a senator or president.
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would not be.
But I can no longer see the republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, to stand as a candidate for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you have done it, and then on the road to the castle.
You do not turn your constituents?
I said to have the whole time that I will take up the fight for the castle on the outcome of the elections.
Later, I have this and said that I will stand as a candidate for the office of the President, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I realized My vision.
I need as much influence and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference.
There are the media who want to rob the, and the freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse.
For me, For example, it was said that I would impress journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have to the fact that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, that it is rejected, and that keeps the population.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a man in politics, rather than on the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
This thinking, but it is completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right, I would like to connect people.
I am always publicly any good solution, even if this comes from the or ODS, and I will against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone described you as populists.
But you do not, what you just said?
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.
And you would like to this.
This as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you are only key words.
And so that you are not in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side, to, in order to achieve these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And then, the would have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, which refers to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur, and I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I started with the policy, and just trying to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation, and if it doesn't work, then I go back in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I am not alone; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I spoke with Radim Janura, for example, but because of work.
I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters have not gone to the elections, and those who are mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I don't have the time to review the past any potential party member, and do not have the money for it.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
You talk about asset declarations, what would your?
I value my private assets to about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I still have a few million In the bank account.
I always liked the a childhood dream - James Bond's Aston Martin was, as he was driving in the car, to women, and at the same time fighting against evil.
You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already spent 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are in fact covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; for example, my son, I could not finance the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
So, as an entrepreneur, in order to have your livelihood?
You said that you will go back these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of the salary.
As promised, I have reduced my activities.
My deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agencies.
The People want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic.
But I have to live on.
In which The monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is the case.
As president, I would, however.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head by the example of Spijkenisse, and the mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally, there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby wholesale company, says: "But it is nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is outlandish record holder.
The has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are on the euro, as a reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to the statistics: a library.
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked nonplussed, and his exquisite souvenirs of the size of the cheeky Maas, a pyramid and ended his speech with the words: "Love."
This is it, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros is expensive.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the books with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is the faceless city retort, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, the white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural's in the history of its existence.
The long road to The book
The first impression: books under glass.
There is a lift, through the hills, but the real and reading room at the nearby climbing the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and is in the middle of a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic room configuration on the head and the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and.
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panelling,,.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the unknown building.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural operation on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a as root.
That is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ready for The rubbish bins.
For the library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in this to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, material, which smells a little for new cars and a little after.
After 105 stages has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says.
It Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass of, the sun shines, even on sunny days only briefly in the interior.
The broad, on the glass facade, and a large part of the sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already the way to the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: The opening of a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - This is to be filled.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
And if it is only.
This is a MVRDV discipline was called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, with Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Germany now has to be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is from his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are in the.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think of their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other major powers, to a certain extent, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have an impact on the in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, which plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by the important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have called for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all, are we talking about Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position.
They are with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a leading role?
Germany is still the lead or?
Germany is still not used to it, that is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes on a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
That does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, not the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but who is?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant, and it is Even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together to the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Brand protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, as long as it is protection, such as the real name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
"It will become more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas in the law firm Taylor Wessing,, a lawyer who specializes in patent rights abuses in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their brands.
It is from Gucci, Prada is simply Lu Gucci, Prada.
German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Standoff hole opens a folder with entries of the Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art, a name that the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are more-floor department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
, however, there are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies receive officially by the Trademark Office for the right to use a term that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call The "bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This means that women are fish rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"It is, we must fight it," calls for the.
"The brand is, the position disappears, the damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the register of are hard to reach and go into the money.
The process can drag on for Up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Reports of cases in which the court rejected, because after the long duration of the name of the "market reality."
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker.
The Chinese must use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo, which recalled BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The Trademark Office in Beijing CTMO is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
But Last year was one of the "emergency position in the workflow returned to normal."
The fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office still 81,500 objections to completion.
On the other hand, to address costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and meant that China, for the 10th time in the list of applications around the world, with the authority.
This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
In 2011, has taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
This means that any application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, to address costs many times, as the case of the German company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal Fabrikation imitation of motor vehicle parts has been.
But the the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
You have failed, because in Germany could not be protected, "said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the process.
We need to watch
Now, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not quantify the company, even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, in a "high six-figure euro amount" on the other side of the settlement.
"You can see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East, even in Europe.
Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This business, but the company has a long time, he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to watch it," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, the foreigners "everything is somehow, in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg In the last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side of fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aids Day:, singing, help
In the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that is more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies and on the parquet floor looking for the, find it quickly.
One two three four.
Only then it shrinks the voices of the singers, slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano - and press.

In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni has found the association Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storyteller or Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently speak no one in this room, but sing.
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings it every now and then, back to where they originally come from: in the South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have succumbed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni small, Swaziland suffers: the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
On the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half, will be accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland the immunodeficiency virus to die in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which not only a lack of parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without education there is no chance in a poor country,.
Initially, it was still a private involvement of individuals, for a few euros per year to send a child to school and to make him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which almost professionally since the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections.
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI HIV, human Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The parasitic lice and itch Felt.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases in Germany reported to be transmitted through sexual contact between men.
Among the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively small - yet: accounts for about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than other groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years.
In this country are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people often.
As the number of infections has developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007.
In 2011, there were 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms related to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in The genital area, complaints when I urinated, discharge, pain and blisters or warts.
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not offer complete protection.
As part of the sexually transmitted diseases can be infections and close physical contact.
As a result, experts recommend changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early most STI cured and can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least, the fee, the choir in Germany ersingt,,.
"We have sent around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, the money from Germany.
It also takes care of the orphans staying well, one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as it is called the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day to the.
Anyone who has not, the house of Khanyisile, a single woman, which is paid by the club as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organised in conjunction with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because the disease across the country is so obviously, it is silent on the dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it also sanctioned by the state is due to the HIV spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms, there would be on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years together through the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent still In times of apartheid.
A bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only mood and joy, but also has some fierce border guards a few tears.
The journey continues to Esitjeni, where The singers visit their children.
Even if the small village on maps, in the valley of the river, it is more than.
"To Esitjeni, there is the light," says the people there.
And if you return to the 8733 miles as the crow flies to Heidelberg, pounding singers in the rehearsal room at the Bergheimer road, then you can see it.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is to be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water there, as well as from three studies published on Thursday in the in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence of the fact that there is an ice in the region of the planet permanently in the shadow.
This is supposed to be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are on The Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to resolve such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the world's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small in.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to star observation.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It can gaze into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, it has a diameter of 11 metres.
As part of the: the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is, after all, despite relatively small mirror diameter - in the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help every computer owner by computing power.
Look at the Observatory of European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also be the medium-sized infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror is a whopping 42 metres - and nearly 1000 mirror elements.
But can be expected until 2018.
2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea was seen as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the summit of Mauna Kea Observatory, which is next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror average of thirty meters.
It is an illustration.
The main impressions from space, However, the Hubble space telescope.
Since the April 24, 1990, it provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, was by the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture are the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be at least until at least 2018 on board a.
The primary mirror of The Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that at the South Pole ice.
However, there are no reliable data, the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, have pointed out that there is on the ice.
The 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Daily drink butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think, would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
The Caucasian ethnic group of the, which is not much known, except that it perfectly and Azeri speaks and is very durable.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts to architecture from Soviet times, which does not want in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe did not come here is too onerous, the from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 miles you need eight hours, because the road is only one.
The fabulous wealth of the country's oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
The is documented in the area of about eight dozen Talyschen older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years of a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which is expected to be 168 years old.
A birth certificate, but does not exist.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is still a daughter.
It Has Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia.
"A striking number of hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia, huge numbers of very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents is no scientific proof of age, especially.
Every day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why live in the south so many people?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the particular genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is a matter of the other.
But that the high-calorie diet of Talyschen should be healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love, and many of those daily drink a glass of melted butter, from a point of view does not seem plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years for this, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel they tirelessly and herrollt.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
Two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect, hidden under her headscarf, long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, they never went out and retained their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva shampoo.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
It tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, an amount that you can live well for local conditions, it is possible.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
The word of human rights "is missing in the Constitution."
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as The basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president not sparing with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all, the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, so far, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the constitutional court temporarily and its competences, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles of the constituent assembly in a, were pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions, in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
That was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a new article: in all matters concerning the Sharia law must be given to the Al-Azhar university, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout in the of the entire Sunni Islam.
This is not, but it may mean that the the legislation, which would be the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
In the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military justice is to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule for the repression of.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" to protect "and promote its morals and values."
This is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of film, art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
In fact, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to or slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
As is the wording of the "insulting people" should be banned.
There is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, which is to be Morsi, and in his to, "very soon" for the referendum will be presented to the Egyptians.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter, before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter MB) of The presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, belong to the draft constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters, "a" coup against democracy.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and him," said the opposition persuade Yasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not to supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, to, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Apollonopolis before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the took part, "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Säubere the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have created civil affairs.
Did not want to risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights, is not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because of the human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag ".
Morsi power extension to all three branches in the state of the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game, and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of civil society, the president de facto," complained Saeda.
But without civil society organisations could not work a democracy.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological struggle on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protester in Tahrir warns: "you gebährt a monster, you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe, but around the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
It is in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
And leave it there for a week.
So you have to think about the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.
If the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also organized the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
The Spirituose can crowd out the smell.
I eat a.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol.
A generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive meals, which you can buy here.
But here, it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
Here you hate it still, to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremist, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in the country.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970s, the growth of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, prudent people.
Her English is just like that of most people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry for the benefit of future generations is invested in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis all threw money around, that they do not have anything, Norway closed its wallet.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and ask for another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening, on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly to show master, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor Jürgen?"
"Are our points,."
Applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival, Will Grant by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of its people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, several important transport routes in the capital, and on the streets for chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto, the will and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon's Mexico could prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, remembered him.
Residents of the write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways, Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which.
With his name outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in the year 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct guy, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was an outstanding statesman, above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, In contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and is in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of critical urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a marginal land near a large landfill were left alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women in the last two years.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1000 women - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he is the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the district, Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to The official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had already begun.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana look down on us. It is next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, the family, so far denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Nörglerin.
They want you to accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But that is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions," she says.
If president Pena Nieto on Saturday, the president, he takes a big responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crimes, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem, particularly during his time in office.
"I hope that as president he is, as he was as governor," says the Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most fear.
The public prosecutor's office said: Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in The military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a rejection of the charges due to harsh prison conditions
The of the US army is accused of thousands of confidential documents to have stolen
The prosecutor's office on Friday, said that the has tried to Bradley Manning, accused in the biggest leak of confidential information of American history - missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse allegedly suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits to prison officials during Mannings neunmonatiger prison in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defence to the rejection of the charges, Manning had been punished enough already by the harsh prison time - had testified Manning in prison, he would have considered the suicide.
The US army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of, while serving in Iraq stole thousands of confidential documents.
The material was released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning went through the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had a by July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When asked on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional."
The forms, so fine, no complaints about abuse, although The officials Manning had directly on his treatment.
Manning said that he had verbally expressed his concerns and the officials had discussed this with him and to deal with them, but they have not been.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)," no problems, "and this is not necessarily that I said nothing at all," Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he did not complained about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, a few months earlier on a form.
Manning said his intention during this meeting, his observation status to "prevention of injury".
The military said that it, there was this restrictive status - he is the one step below the suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that it was good to get rid of and the observation status for the prevention of injury (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life, in my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning said his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before he was transferred to in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base in Virginia.
He said in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat again.
I do Not know what was happening with him or in the outside world, was.
"My world fell on Camp Arafjon, in this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning had spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
Only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or lie down.
He had to sleep with the light outside in his cell.
If he had turned up at night and guards could not see his face, was woken him, so that he is back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning in the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Manning also asked the judge on Friday to a charge that he had raised in his statement on Thursday, he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in, and must be at a morning counting naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this census never had the opportunity to with its ceiling.
At the hearing on Friday Manning, he had concluded from a command of his guards that he would have been able to cover the ceiling, with which he should be to. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was in the previous night, forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an official that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning said the official that he would have been able to use the of his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself, but not done so.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses have been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his detention and will drastically reduce, he should be condemned before the military court at his trial, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be minor offences guilty, while other charges that are considered too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor is expected to be a justification of the detention conditions.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules that apply to all prisoners under the highest security precautions in the.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Due to the lack of opportunities, Many people are forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control as disturbing to me.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds long, uncertain, which I should go.
I grew up in central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "Mexican". "
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to talk in this language on both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go well.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that, if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are not the memories of this event.
, as soon as a U.S. government official only mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of on the war path.
And yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is in fact, in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for whom it does not do this.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, perhaps, but when it comes to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is certainly in the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
They say that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally as a child in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
While it is a US citizen, sees herself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, on the not on the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any one of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and to to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid you alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
The Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There will be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in The bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings were in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting the on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, to say that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and corners of the planet, Israel has so far, not to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, Hamas has taken party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be as a player that can't, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
The Israeli hardliners, however, an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is not a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States hold their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the, which in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been of international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a group.
Why is this cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they had control of the West Bank, in fact, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza, fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish you, they should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to, But the Arab spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will focus on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair its economy.
This pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is that the one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, where Israel is for security purposes.
The for the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the of and a common Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for un observer status.
Obama also needs to do its part to push Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also to participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging in force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia, came into force, logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, olive green cap, are also printed with graphic images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoke sick infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images from next Saturday, is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters.
Australia is the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke will start with 26, with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message of tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. It cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo associated with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said, with the laws of the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone covers for the companies to cover the unbearable packaging has, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago because of the Supreme Court with their appeal of the law.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media in precisely the population, to which the plan.
A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, to act as sponsors, and most traders were forced to sell cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertising is on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and, but has no influence on The international sides.
"Who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to advertise its products, does not have to the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman noted an increase in reports to brands that have been written by "ordinary people."
We must ask the question: is this just a private person who is so much Marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focuses instead on marketing to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules, those countries complain to the World trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries pursuing greater trade in Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada 2001 was the first country to, the photographic warnings.
They have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I ignore it.
"It is simply a, and the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying with the purchase of a cigarette packet on a photo is printed with a mouth tumour.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that this is my little girl.
James Yu, of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the single packaging have the filling its shelves.
"I have a hour to classify a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have prohibited cigarettes altogether - then we would have said okay, that's it, we are close," he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane unexpectedly due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight to, is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes bored.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
And because most of us, almost constantly on a screen or, we do not get the benefits of boredom.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"In fact, the boredom is a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job to do, but not to be able to define."
Boredom is different from apathy, in such a way that the person is not, but it would be.
The apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although, even though these two conditions, could be bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that it is boring, even if we only have to concentrate.
In their study, "the Unengaged mind: Defining boredom in terms of attention" - for example: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud tv program from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you put a monotonous work, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people who are physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will be boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a "scale in the 1980s, to boredom vulnerability."
On the scale there are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters.
In the year 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment In which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and the were bored, while 23% said to be bored, if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
But he was sure that "youth is seen as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in extreme cases, it does not mean that people take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to, in order to relieve - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This view is professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to say that we should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what you should do it best.
If it is boring and you use the energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But television can in the short term for happiness, these evaporate But in the long term.
Anyone who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also do not see it.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home, away from the constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we would have to be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly, it is hard to look, when the noise is silent."
In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia -, each with a penalty of US $100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on hundreds of minor drug on the law, on the site.
Hundreds of, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession of small. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, and people are still in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains on new, to prevent a state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch on the.
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states of Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Orientation of the state is," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed at this time - for example, as the government of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed.
"Nowhere is it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November sent Chief Oates an email to his employees in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years longer, and that the police "" will not for these offences.
The police Chief Oates added that will continue to enforce the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County In northern Colorado represents County prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, even though many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations, in which it to the point of the offence," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of not longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not think that I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
In a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes, and as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an age of legal, they are also nervous wait on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several high-profile arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that no doors will likely to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist the legal under the new legislation to by the state regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado, not just wait for the fact that the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this legislation.
We have done this for the community, not, for what the state decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for her views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the - I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room had sex.
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same equal protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality of their college, in order to ensure that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student association has been shown, among other things, It was of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce and with silver suit and.
At other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon club, without us to at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the Last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give title.
The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors mockery of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. What should have been, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students.
In my eyes wallten tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time, if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
On this evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone typed me slightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory,.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse For you.
Most Tory, to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A number of new entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, which had visited as a conservative force, ironically, the Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As the Tories have sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt so as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I Would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would like to meet like-minded people only after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, I extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
This is something like that they would never do in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
Tarnished his moist eyes.
A chance.
I am sure you neckt.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, in which claimed another history tutor seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents to a "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.
As they went, I was a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford, who did not only 14 Tory prime Minister, but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," which opened this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This is the designer at the opening of "Valentino: master of couture," a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 dresses of the haute couture, which has been created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says, with its distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani, is not without its clients could have been written.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be 3 March, there is a lot of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from humble fashion in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
In the love, does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they are not their sites on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We all were delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the Exfrau of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion.
Many years ago, we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decor, the food and the music and felt its influence.
"All the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "Top Model," which began her career in the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion, his of works of art," she says.
Fashion show The origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of Versessenheit, more of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 metre catwalk, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model, and along the catwalk to admire a beautiful "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress, which Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience of fashion dolls names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006.
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for women, and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors, which he used; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d of Arenberg can not forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed, to have the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it was.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and draped bodice with a, which makes his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d of Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," said the Italian Aristokratin between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D "Arenberg preserved their evening dresses of the fashion maker" with the utmost care "," because it is not a dress just a dress, but also the memories associated with them. "
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a Four and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the top of society."
For many years, with the "savoir être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award, Cavaliere del Lavoro Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I will be refinement, his, and perfect," D "Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And that says a princess...
The most difficult job in the world: the human Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater, where the earth, sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths made of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, the balance and they must put their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen volcano.
The Kawah Ijen mine workers earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which.
At the top, they pave the path between the tourists like circus monkeys and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (rather) is exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and is used for the production of woods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"We are usually 70 kg, we get around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," explains to us Anto, which makes three routes on the day.
For each track that he needed three hours, according to which he is completely, at the end of the day, but it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is in Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned with his family, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life at the Kawah Ijen volcano for three years on the, whose sulfur already left the first traces of him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years ago, because I open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but young man life overregulated could work as a tourist guides, waiters or working on the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, and every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur applying at night, where his distinctive yellow color shines in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater.
About 400 winners are on the crater floor baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has mechanized the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and the work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, as well as the of this nature parks, together with the entrance fee of rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to the shooting of the volcano and human.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a sturdy, which operates three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen volcano.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and eyes, when the wind suddenly and can become trapped mine workers in the thick pillars rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years, only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
From his five children, the oldest working with his 30 years as sulphur.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on the Kawah Ijen volcano.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapurer lay the blame for the fact that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of housing and education.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore, a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "," bao "(loaf) in the oven to start worrying about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company, which shot the video, preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it is an issue we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If you do not take this lightly, is the government of Singapore.
Each year, they are US dollars for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority, says that this was a "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to marry and to form a family more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone, and delaying marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a drastic increase in the to counter the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely masked xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for the low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons for the fact that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, the example shows Singapore unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are to be built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and cannot be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they discourage construction companies to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is the discussions with the Singapurern working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it is by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It is important for me, to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they have no children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children, because the government can do so much.
The offline private is offline online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property privately or "the area of private life, where they have the right to protection from any type of interference."
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
This definition applied to your everyday life and the social networks?
He understands the risks to which he exposes himself, if he is in the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which are often in the network.
In four of the cases of the term "something very own" on a personal level, and on the password and user "when they apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I invite beautiful images or images of games.
I think my time with friends.
"I would not share a photo that is not for me, or someone who makes a fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked, from crime to write or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured 35 friends, he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.
I reported on to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if someone responds to me, I invite them high," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak with relatives or friends, in the distance," he states.
He says that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of The 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts into Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, not to know 20 of The people, he has attached his friends list.
"It scares me not because we have something in common, such as music," he admits.
No one, according to the has made him hints or asked for his address or phone number.
"If someone afflicted me or asked me, I remove it from my account," he admits.
José Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation.
The boy experiences are not unknown, known as.
The friend of a friend was in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José the victim did the account was not closed.
"He has made it private."
Then he explained a number of steps to configure an user account.
In contrast to this boy Jorge would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic or I want to me.
"But I know that this is," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at the University of Yale and the author of the "digital natives and Immigrants" these words to explain the phenomenon.
They are The digital natives, The children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them where we learn," he says.
He said that it is a complex issue, "because we ask them, that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or, said in an age where the maturity is not enough."
"They should also be picky when it is the most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions that they thought.
"To tell you, they are not To do not work," he says.
Porras calls after some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: would you like it published a photo of you, as you posted from a friend?
Do you know what the others about you?
The other people you've asked for permission, if you have pictures of celebrations labelled?
And another question: do you need to know what you are doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them to understand that they must act as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the of the social networks.
If they understand all of them, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you should share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, the children of the lesson "thou shalt not talk to strangers".
The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The sixth summit of the president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced previously and, in theory,, should be signed by the seven attending leaders.

"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who in the sixth summit of the president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans, "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today is a country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the member states of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who teach, never commit to something, and in return, we will sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it had given "at the time, that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him to submit to an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish law allows this through a video conference on the Ecuador Embassy in London could have been carried out."
Correa said that there was a danger that would affect the health and mental condition of Assange.
"Since then in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he would physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a tight space and no physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted to the month of June at the embassy of Ecuador in London was in the granting of a, which could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe. He said he pointed out that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures at various European institutions," he said.
"If Britain morning granted the licence, I believe that in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogated over Skype, as allowed under Swedish law, and in other cases, the problem is the.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, that he congratulated Ecuador more dominated by such journalists "and not the bankers or hegemonic and countries,", and he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must stand firm and no opportunism and no legal coup d'etat," because it ", the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which gave the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, for "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they need to be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to reach his third mandate in, he admitted that he sees the "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Has never interested me personally, but in doing so, as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the likely victory guaranteed, so I must assume this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life.
This is also true that if we lose.
"It has been decided," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled for a planned routine treatment there, and that would be expected after the election campaign that he could travel back to Cuba.
"It was in no way means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian leader in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to go to his illness and began to inform, and this with such dedication that He has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to see how many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
But many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense, "can easily be 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from cases in 2007 to in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of of the patients have died in the national database.
In the year 2011 255 people died in Jalisco, and the month of May this year there are 187 deaths since 2005, but assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why so people are still dying?
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state, because they do not know their infection, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a powerful statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, and that is why all the people, where it is massive screening tests must be offered."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (national committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, who was already carry out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and do not want to hear.
"If I have to die, then it is three times burst," said, in my case.
The change was to improve, I ernähre well, and take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am a lot, I have an active, but responsible, I am to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, which agreed to share intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage those who have with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
"In certain places, the distribution of condoms was actually increased;, they were, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk for new infections among young people.
"What do you need?" Is a widespread derision question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent.
He proposed to this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilet facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not enough; it is the best way to bring the closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know It.
After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro, which has been achieved by a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country, which has payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements have no validity.
In practice on 15 June recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, the Mexican companies are subject to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, the door to call for three inconsistencies of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge of the matter that lenders must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, says the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the is the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the event of companies with trans-national profile is not known.
In fact, was created to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute was used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling determined that without the votes of the companies for recognition of the in the bankrupt estate the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) were confirmed by.
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had, would not have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States, which has been in the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada before the same court of appeal, so that the vote takes place in the house, by all the judges, because only three of them.
It is not the, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the procedure by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and that is pointed out that it had to the agreement signed by both countries to respond to Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantees equality of debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican unions for air traffic from former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Federation of trade unions of the pilots) finally made progress.
The inquiry led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau now has a criminal case against the national bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the headquarters of the Republic on a transaction carried out by the to withdraw from the trustee account F / 589 on the name of the bank IXE Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the purchase of shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting at the weekend on a forum at the University of the Caribbean have a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society, the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country on the other side of the wall, supplemented by a living area for the staff of 150 companies.
In the run-up to the (the national chamber of manufacturing) to the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment, which has been partly protected areas and the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador to Japan, signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known by the English acronym ACTA, did not, the matter has already been filed in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property has already.
As you know, these measures, even though the Senate had the opportunity to, because he saw it As a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
In the long term Homex long-term
In the quest to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex stock certificates over 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life."
The organization of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was connected to the for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years, as a player and manager in the lower classes, players of the first national League, agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of basketball Association.
"My whole life I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and almost all of them.
Bayamón in the heart
The emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the centre of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as a manager or of the club.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, has been further or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then took over, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "said Reyes.
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow recommended that the free throw Proffesionals Raymond Gausse, and was one of our best shooter.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who the that won 2004 Olympics against the Dream team.
My favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure to those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
There was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best, What you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in one season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do?
I like to listen to music, watch videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R., made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television network CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in the surrounding area was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "who shot J.R.?," to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars have been bet in betting houses.

"I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman 1988.
It should read "here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business that he has not won.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as a "huge personality in and outside of the screen."

He also smoking and took part in several campaigns.

Every week, the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
