Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners 
Scneelose runways Sorgenn not only the giant mountains residents. 
The lack of snow discourages people of appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions. 
It can therefore in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
Our pages are often visited. 
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to cultivate binding. 
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "to see" will be, the operator of the information portal spindl. Info, Martin Jandura. 
Anyone who wants to stay in the New Year's Eve Spindelmühle exactly according to his ideas, should not hesitate more with the appointment. 
Anyone who prefers saving and in the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days. 
The Spindelmühle hotel owners are now for the New Year's Eve day mostly only weeks stays. 
I think that they will seek to sell them for a while, but then they must also give in, and for shorter times. 
And then the free rooms will be quickly, estimated Jandura. 
Free beds in all winter dates is always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi. 
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not long now. 
In our offer is about half the seats are still free. 
That is why we have prepared some cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert. 
The New Year's Eve day in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi travel agency also, but here there are fewer free seats. 
Good (also find the first fourteen days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average. 
This year is influenced the interest for the winter were also negatively that in Giant always no snow. 
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls. 
No one wants to spend the Jahresende in the mountains without snow. 
Should be verschneit the runways within a week, will also sell out this Christmas, says Schiefert. 
Conversely, and a little better than last year, manages to fill the room in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou. 
We are about five percent better than in the previous year. 
On New Year's Eve Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms. 
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in the Janua, and in February will run the business as well, the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada. 
With 80 percent for the New Year's Eve visits is also the hotel Omnia in Zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne. 
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds. 
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60%. 
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment, when the snow, is the interest in the placements in Giant, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch. 
On a more snow Mess wait the Giant hotel owners now. 
On Thursday it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should be the snow on the mountains. 
But then again be a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove. 
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom 
It is almost comical, with which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of Afghanistan, which he considered himself for the Dümmsten. 
When he finally his gaze longingly awaited Afghanistan doctrine ausschwitzte, it emerged that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq scenario three years. 
Not only that, in the text itself, he used the expression "as in Iraq ", he has even the name of the one from either statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: 'new Go way" used, not to hesitate. 
Has he himself three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq to send - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision ". 
Subsequent months showed that the recommendations of the military, Bush strategy is the only possible and was very successful in the that you do not speak today in the news about Iraq. 
Bush's reputation has not improved by objectively, because he has hintergelassen his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected. 
In the Afghanistan hopes Barack Obama repeatedly that the miracle of repeatedly. 
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military it again, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten vacillating - trench in the White House. 
He called for 40,000 soldiers, in order to be able to reverse the situation for the better. 
The President has three months, but no better idea and he has betrayed the General wenistens at 10,000 soldiers. 
From Europe, has the promise for a further 5,000, even though he himself. 
Highly problematic for the Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine has left more questions than answers. 
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq. 
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraq also society relatively well structured, their leaders pay tribute to the values. 
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - on any one can leave and there are no agreements. 
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used to change every day. 
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, remain just a veneer of buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further. 
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan- and Iran influences. 
The building of a "strong state ', which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic. 
Time horizon of the Obama strategy by his voluntarism 
Over the last eight years has worsened the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the fringes of the explosion. 
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cry about the "Spring Homecoming" broke out, create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul who are not impressed. 
From the political point of view is the date set for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban than the indirect confession of American defeat. 
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out. 
Europe's politicians cannot and will not declare their voters also, the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush Gebirgsvorland. 
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and not the more sanctions on the Iranians, the United States is a very serious issue, whether or not to solve the problem with troops. 
This question must be answered in the period, in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation. 
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election and, therefore, there is still enough time so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls would prove this as a total loss. 
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses more in cash 
The chief executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses premiums this year more in cash.

In addition, can be shares the managers in the case, if they act too risky. 
Goldman Sachs is in accordance with the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts to link the premium Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance. 
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of society's, Douglas Elliott. 
The problem is in the details, he added. 
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism, having shown for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion in premiums bonuses. 
The total amount of premiums bonuses in the course of this Jahra will probably also despite the today after the Reuters news agency reported measure exceed $20 billion. 
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector with the onset of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the most controversial political issue. 
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends the bonuses of bankers, the £25,000, with a tax of 50 percent. 
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

Prime Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle 
President Vaclav Klaus at the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota on Friday morning, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for next year, in the form in which this has been released by the Assembly on Wednesday, disagrees. 
It is thought that will be the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet in the issues of the day meeting. 
The budget is criticised by Klaus. 
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which deepened the crisis of public finances. 
On the meeting informed the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat , . 
On the future in his capacity Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate. 
After the budget bill, which is now receiving Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor. 
But were voted on Wednesday in Parliament on the Left Party proposals for money and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers. 
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit. 
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic dispute, transformed the question mark over the future work of the fishermen officials cabinet, on which the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring. 
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures, the fish 'government in the autumn have been used, and the public debt. 
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, must not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have neglected for a long time. 
In his opinion, there are no good solution. 
An improvement could bring only a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties. 
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence. 
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of officials cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green party seems more. 
Premier Fischer described in the drafting similar words as a "strong worry." 
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek said that the budget deficit is terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeds the 200 billion kronor. 
On Wednesday, CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success. 
The People's Party also was satisfied. 
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint East Wood of Morgan Freeman 
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene" shows the world much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that was occupied the main role of an American actor. 
The story tells of sports, racial Verhältnissen and Nelson Mandela. 
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American actor Oscar, Morgan Freeman,. 
They said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film. 
A further important role Damon. 
I said to him: "If you play, I must take you. 
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the East Wood drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has become the slave owners, a fictional U.S. president, and also in "Evan Allmächtig ", but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela. 
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic 27 years in prison. 
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country. 
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
"invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen ", and at the same time, it is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was issued in 1875. 
The requirement was to speak as he 
The film recounts a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, leading to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically. 
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, the outsiders, in the world. 
Finally, the South Afrikanische team until the World Cup of 1995. 
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela history on the cinema screens. 
He had no other goal than to play this role, these as closely as possible to bring the reality, said Freeman. 
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he. 
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes. 
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand. 
I have noted, if I schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said. 
For me, it is important to become a different person. 
Little condemnation Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed. 
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world. 
It was a big surprise for him, as he Pienaar for the first time in his house. 
I remember when I rang the door bell, that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, it was: 'in the film, I see a lot more '. 
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the comedian compared with their actual role models, he has headed by director East Wood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar. 
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well include film." 
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes. Com, has Invictus 76 percent positive assessments.

The Norwegians have also since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket. 
The generals has diesesmal challenged, and said that we cannot talk clearly from a failure. 
The first two stages of the rocket fell and affected by the accident was only the third stage.

Even if no test launch without error, the head of the Verteidigungsministeriums only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.

Czech discovery: a substance, which is also in 'like' HIV viruses works 
The team of Czech and German scientists new compounds, which are intended to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body. 
The main advantage of improved substance that he is also the viruses that are resistant to drugs. 
This fact is against the drawback is that the link to normal virus variants as strong as one of the existing medicines. 
The disease AIDS can be cured not yet. 
The patients, the medication compilation but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body. 
But their income will be accompanied by a whole series of side effects. 
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the development sg. resistentviren, against the medicines are no longer effective. 
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemisch technological University) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how we can deal with resistance to the virus. 
They have shown that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane substance, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV Viruses. 
The Metalokarborane are links from boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem. 
In the work of the scientists to new 'improved ties, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the Molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viruses protein. 
The Metalokarborane have an unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from, for example, water, clothing and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked. 
Heinous and lasting virus 
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus. 
Without the Protease HIV caused by the HIV virus division would not be Infektionsvirenpartikel mature. 
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients from, say the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR. 
In the work, which in the science newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, scientists describe the whole industry-until the compounds, in which two couples cages (see table) by a brief organic chain, which is then systematically forth-that changed. 
A weaker, but reliable 
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne produced tested, including their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV infected patients. 
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against which the medicines are often ineffective. 
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical impact, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research, on the development of effective drugs against HIV says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute. 
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back 
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence. 
The ODS, described the Prime Minister's statement as a "strong worry ". 
It is time for the analysis. 
The deputy ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of cabinet officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green party seems more. 
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it, in order to remain in office through the Parliament left. 
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas. 
Parliament has approved on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party amendments on more than 12 billion kronor. 
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers. 
The government has the proposals of social democracy, that they subtly increase the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor. 
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, so she has complied with the wishes of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisional frase not clear. 
Frustration and futility 
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas quoted Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government's assessment of the current situation. 
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different. 
In accordance with the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the government business of Premier. 
He has indicated that he thought to remain in office. 
Reason is his disappointment at the Verhandugn of the budget. 
To what extent for the continuation of the fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas the Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), which had obtained in the budget, the changes in the government to do nothing. 
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit will enhance laws, for example, the, the sick pay and pensions or the service law should be changed. 
Topolanek: by ODS nominated ministers were wrong not 
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the government. 
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States. 
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who subscribe to TOP 09 who voted against the budget. 
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decided to abandon the battle against the level of deficit in public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament ". 
Then he can count allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens of Democrats. 
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament. 
Premier fishermen flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels. 
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister back 
Necas stressed that the ODS probably would vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the amended budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats explicitly asking that they enable the adoption of the budget. 
We shall not orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leaders of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not rolled back. 
I have not noticed that my vote would lack. 
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months in particular could see with their own Parliament and destruction of everything would be go, Topolanek itself.

As President of the Republic of South Africa, he was elected in 1994 - 1999. 
Great expectations are placed in the film, because he comes at a time in the cinema, in which culminate in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the world Cup, but at the same time the media world opinion with daunting news about rising racial hatred and discrimination against the from the ruling majority. 
According to the news agency AP are the responses to the new film in South Africa for the time being consistently positive, despite many reservations about the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars. 
Morgan Freeman is his own words, according to the new film yet proud. 
In this role gerträumt I have for many years and I have prepared myself well. 
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive - as they say - his energy, he took in the interview after the Festspielpremiere of cinema in Los Angeles.

Morgan Freeman made in the course of the film, two racial and trying for delineated each other population groups together and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he, too, in his role in the South African National Dress rugby World Cup field, has won the South Africa at the time. 
For the lawn in the Dress, which applies in South Africa, almost like a sacred act, will be greeted with Mandela fourteen years ago great ovation, mostly from the white audience and has won the recognition of the white population. 
The rugby Cup walks, perhaps, the people, in turn, led to a single people, the rugby players Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "Black" in the national team. 
Whether improved the tense situation in South Africa, that will show. 
The white South Africans are sceptical, such as, for example, in a recent interview with UAA the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, betrayed, fled the country after the United Kingdom. 
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jancura makes criminal proceedings for libel against three head of the CSSD. 
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, criminal proceedings for libel against three socially democratic leaders today. 
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik. 
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal. 
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts. 
All regions have signed but ultimately the long-term contracts with the Czech railways. 
All three head and tell us that we take the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them. 
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week. 
So we are left with nothing else than to defend us. 
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura Radio Journal. 
At the same time, he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law. 
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission. 
Hasek considers the criminal proceedings for the continuation of the Medialshow of Jancura who him as free advertising for his company, as well as for his own person. 
I am of course prepared my good name and reputation in my district to defend, and I also call for further head on. 
I assume that will also take this matter, that it is Jancura, manipulated in the cause of Regionaleinsenbahnverkehrs the public and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek. 
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts. 
The radio Journal, he said that he cut off the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue this after the New Year. 
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such. 
The campaign has launched Jancura, after the districts at the behest of the regional rail transport with the Czech railway agreed and for the contract in a High at 150 billion kronor had no invitations to tender. 
After Vancura such behaviour is illegal and incompatible with the requirements of the European Court of Justice. 
Because of the criticism of the trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD. 
The only threat, if we do not, we can lose the Buslizenzen. 
He was as a member of the CSSD before, I know who it is, I am not saying his name, said Jancura Radio Journal today. 
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily 
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January to Gewohnte. 
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary. 
But now the floor votes, that would be the mandatory vaccination more effectively. 
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against culminate Pneumokokken. 
The drug institute is already the highest prices of vaccines, which must pay for health insurance. 
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure. 
New vaccination 
Vaccines, free of charge for August children 
From January can be children vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born. 
The condition st that they have not received any Impfdosis. 
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay further repetition vaccination itself. 
The first Impfdosis must be between 3 and 5th month of life of the child. 
Already last year, a quarter of the families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children. 
The parents paid DKK 1600 and more for a dose. 
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required. 
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities from 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year. 
They save but the treatment, which would need the children without vaccination. 
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around $500,000 per year. 
The duty of vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package. 
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning. 
Us for investigation die from Pneumokokken infections in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years. 
Apart from the Czech Republic was introduced the duty of vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in approximately 40 countries. 
It will be the vaccination duty? 
At the same time, said that this vaccine duty could be in the future. 
From January to paid by the insurance and be voluntary. 
That the compulsory vaccination would be mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky. 
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination. 
The experts at the international conference, was involved in our union, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination. 
This is not quite the ideal. 
On the other hand, we are pleased that we succeeded, at least. 
I believe that this is the way we must go now, led Kalovsky. 
The Ministry of Health wants to change but not the Impfverfahren against Pneumokokken. 
In this moment, we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen . 
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors. 
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, too, that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks. 
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the possibility of reducing the repetition of vaccination number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine launched a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova $. 
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents to vaccinate infants against Pneumokokken from next year. 
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is also speaking, that was the first to land vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not the state. 
The insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova. 
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves. 
This is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines. 
After the initial projects should be bought the vaccines by the insurance companies and doctors receive them on the same path, as well as other by the state, they spent vaccines. 
Some Members were, however, that the insurance companies, "the money from the health insurance bringing ". 
The doctors, the vaccines themselves and will therefore have to wait until the insurance companies pay them. 
According to the estimates will to invest the individual practitioners 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum. 
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova. 
Still they and we 
Can the Islam-as French? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
At a time, the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most pronounced säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated. 
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the work of the author: "Why the French no scarves love" (original title: "Don ’ t Like my the French Headscarves ") (2006) read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, the country for over a year and a half decades and are employed and its impact even today. 
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum. 
As a good anthropologist would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is happening in the field. 
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic freedom ". 
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that most concern. 
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a town hall marry (or both)? 
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals? 
Can marry a Muslim woman a non-Muslim man? 
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system, in order to get a mortgage? 
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas, the media. 
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a born in Switzerland Arabic Muslim scholars and academics. 
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They do not have all the arguments on their side. 
The Conservatives are suspicious about the idea of a French or European Islam. 
The thinkers and activists, questioned the Bowen, with their counterparts Salafi usually divided - supporters of the liberalist Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia - which is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims. 
Bowen is of the opinion that could be Muslim values and French secularism compatible. 
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides. 
He queries whether the French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who guarded so passionate the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism. 
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism. 
He sees a "values of tightening of the screws" as a growing pragmatism. 
Can the Islam-as French? After reading this book is inclined to say 'yes, but not yet ". 
The trostloseste outlook of the world 
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth. 
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and takes life that can survive anywhere else. 
Oil, gas, remiss and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake. 
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, is in "On thin ice" (original title: "On thin ice ") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bears. 
Au fait with the complicated history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher, which have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears. 
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle musket-shape fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true. 
Young, who were caught when they schwammen behind the bodies of their mothers, were recently killed in zoos and circuses. 
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century was 75 polar bears in a vision. 
Even today, Zooanlagen still typically a millionth of the life of wild Alttiers. The climate is rare: the Eisbär in Singapore was quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his fur. 
Add you here, in order to find out more. 
Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often to the threat, the hunters for the survival of the species. 
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the Erlegen in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in using helicopters and motor sleigh mobile Inuit powerful assault rifles, to express their prey. 
Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two hunting nations the ice longest remain. 
In his new book "Following the ice" (original title "After the ice ") offers Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine new Scientist," a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop. 
Not that scientists have all the answers. 
Neither atmospheres scientists are still Ozeanografen can explain the speed of change. 
However, this is not a lack of explanation testing. 
The pioneering journeys by Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century, for the first time, the Verwirbelung the pack ice.

An useful complement are Satellitenvermessungen and the widespread application of measuring probes on Eisbergen, but is still much by brave people who camped out in the cold. 
Anderson is looking into the strange, tiny world of supply system within the Arctic ice that is formed by salt water torrents, which will be zusammengedrückt. 
But, starting with the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in ice, all of them are threatened, once the summer ice, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.

Marines were among the 6,000, the Arlington placed wreaths laid down 
The Obergefreite De 'Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met. 
For him and the other marines, the journey from Camp Johnson in Jackson Ville, North Carolina, the national cemetery in Arlington, in order to decorate graves, was the day a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are entered. 
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers. 
If we had, I would like to see, someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect. 
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery. 
Morrill Worcester, holder of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, 1992 this tradition, as he and some others are determined to several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington. 
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, which make this trip each year, in various cities along the road to hold events, the people in the military and are dedicated to victims of terrorism. 
The Worcesters founded a non-profit organization, wreaths across America (placed wreaths across America), which has extended the event to other states.

The Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 for the second time for purchase and transport of placed wreaths. 
Char Leen Hunt, 70, said from Westminster that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers. 
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims. 
She said that this is a small contribution, how we can support civilians our soldiers. 
It is so as the visit of a family tomb. 
Wrapped in areas best clothes within the volunteers across the vast lawn areas and hills of the cemetery. 
The volunteers were older graves from the 1th and 2th World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, since these are not as often as the newer graves, the organisers. 
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held in the hand, while the fresh pine branches to the grey of grave stones. 
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper part was getting out. 
Section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, almost calm. 
The United Service across 1,000 placed wreaths, this section to kill, but the gloomy mood of the current wars this area. 
Individual wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the icy air. 
Some read aloud the names in stone since before, during hinabbeugten others to small black and white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet ready. 
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who before the grave of her son, bitter tears was crying.

Contractors, the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested 
The Cuban government has a contractor for the U.S. government, sold the cell phones and Notebook computers in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday. 
The contractor, not yet been identified, working for Development Alternatives Genetics, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
Konsularbeamte the representation of interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December. 
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the charge of the 'risk' can be arrested. 
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including the slight protests and critical writings, there is a risk of arrest. 
Royal Color inscriptions and statements are viewed as a serious crime. 
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, which will be led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked. 
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected. 
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a "slow" had sought rapprochement to improve relations with the island. 
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times. 
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will provide a contribution, if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition. 
Mobile phones and note Books in Cuba legally, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employees $15 per month. 
The Cuban government allows only since this year ordinary citizens the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for depends mainly on the Versenden of text messages, which would cost a 15 minütiges telephone conversation a day's wages. 
The Internet use is restricted on the island. 
It is in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors and some government departments, such as universities, accessible. 
Cubans who want to connect, often the government must notify their names. 
Too many websites is restricted access. 
In Cuba is the arrest of an American is rare. 
Most of the few U.S. citizens, who are in prison in Cuba, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the U.S. interests representation in Havana. 
Berbena said that they could give no further information on the arrest. 
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong. 
An activity that is legal in any other free society legally - the levy free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as leader of the country, the ailing older brother Fidel. 
Vivanco said that the defendants arrested very often within a day, were convicted and imprisoned. 
He said that would probably be any solution politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries for more dialogue. 
Pakistan government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan 
Pakistan authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy, aimed five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help, an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, the Internet after radicalised young men. 
Investigators said that receiving-special opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan, after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks. 
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. 
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not persuade the Al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA plot to undermine the terrorist network. 
As a result, they were held in the eastern city Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north west, which have become a terrorist haven. 
They were seen as part of a covert operation. 
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
The government officials said that the men do not have been and continue to the right to receive recommendations in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities. 
The case of five men - which remains in Pakistan are and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy. 
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, has made it the U.S. secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda. 
The recruiters the organisation act as guardians, the old ones, whose commitment to the holy war seriously enough and such, could be the spies. 
American does recruits from a Qaeda recruits a special examination, said analysts. 
On the basis of their potential access to U.S. objectives and its propaganda value be regarded as extremely attractive for the group. 
As Kohl man, let the analyst NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years become much more cautious about who they allow access, because the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods. 
If you try to get someone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow that so many have followed?, said Kohl man. 
The model is based much more on the Internet. 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding in Copenhagen climate 'action " 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded here by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre of the city kühneres action on climate change. 
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000. 
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the city centre zündete. 
On a day when the promoted by the U.N. climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners in English, "through the city, which there is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "Earth says' enough '. 
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of their birth mother, her aware, with the heart-breaking problems the country on the basis of the already significant effects of climate change. 
This is part of the reasons why I have chosen to take part in the mass demonstration - pass to the floor and appeal to the world leaders, a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said. 
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the games. 
The police, the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were hooded either or mitführten pocket knife. 
According to Danish law are banned these actions during demonstrations. 
A viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the negotiations on climate change, setting anonymous demonstrators in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near where several ministries. 
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that they started flares, but then followed by "a few large explosions ". 
In the interior of the Congress Centre assembled from the people on television screens, in order to pursue all afternoon the demonstration. 
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, does not seem to be achieved. 
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "that is something of which I was not aware of." 
He then in Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I can hear what is happening out there." 
He found that it is on record as from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would hurt or help. 
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said. 
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people ". 
Test data show persistent racial divide 
The certificates to mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington d. c. 
Although the district Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the Höchst services, show the evidence that the Viert- and Achtklässler faster progress than cities in the last two years, the Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made. 
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and National level. 
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington d. c. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), the African-American their peers, but only by three points from 209 to 212. 
The achievement gap, in fact, between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points. 
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he was a statistically significant point from 245 to 244. 
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough. 
The picture is not encouraging over a six-year period. 
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP became covered in this district, 60 scale points (262 to 202). 
And although the item number who have children of both groups, has grown in that time span, has been reduced the difference with 58 points. 
Some education advocates of the Javan said last week its concern that the results, the school Chancellor Michelle a. Rhee and democratic Mayor Adrian m. Fenty, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children, have been promoted. 
This suggests that we have the Gesamtwertung raised by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of the d. c. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington d. c.. 
I do not move for a span of two or three points and, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame r. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school. 
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said, is of the Prüfungspunktzahlen's message is that the city's secondary schools need urgent attention. 
Of course, we want to always see the positive signs, which I respect. 
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend approximately the time and energy that we need to stand up for our middle school. 
Rhee said, the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils. 
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum that Wilson reading system to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their young counterparts classes comrades. 
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to class for the sixth games and lebensechte experience in the foreground, under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum are some of the NAEP progress, were reported last week. 
I believe that we must continue to work, the best measures the pupils benefit under the central level, said Rhee. 
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will provide the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap. 
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, studied the urban audit results. 
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington d. c.. 
The objective could create political fallout, work against these important agenda item. 
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class. 
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system great schools. 
We need to strengthen our schools in the city's neighborhoods, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education. 
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is in Washington, the traditional public school year, which currently stands at 180 days, to extend, in order to compete with charter schools. 
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey who, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next Treaty. 
High school education for more people than a future 
The bus reached the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle. 
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn. 
Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador. 
Until recently, had also Graciela, in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in River Dale, never set foot on a college campus. 
Explore their views and those of the other Achtklässler the group, the Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 per year, was more of an ehrfurchtsvollen visitor, rather than the future of an enthusiastic students. 
"yes, I will soon be here!" exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, when the leaders that they had entered the building for natural sciences. 
"wow, really?" she said, as the low Professor to student ratio of school. 
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7 th, have visited the children to their three-day tour and now they have included the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's model-defines College. 
The question is, where. 
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School end or as a teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, which received the college training that is in the middle class. 
In truth is one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the College - which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents are immigrants here, mostly from Mexico and Central America, completed in the United States, without the High School. 
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labour force in the country, show the way forward. 
Those who study high-achieving children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and an intrinsic powered to success. 
Many of them also have parents who give their children to aim high and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools. 
But advice programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts over a longer period. 
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students studied. 
We need to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school up through the High School. 
The federal program, which had financed Gracielas College Tour, is an useful example. 
It is known as Gear up - a date hochschalten - and provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school. 
According to the U.S. Department of Education has helped the programme since 1999, more than 10 million pupils, of which more than 60% in college. 
Iraq's oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies from 
Despite concerns about violence and political instability has been able to bring the Iraqi government in two on Saturday completed auctions major oil companies can get his rebuild damaged infrastructure. 
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions. 
American companies have seen only shares in two of the 10 auctioned for themselves. 
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday. 
The only company that is a commandment, has drawn the Kürzeren. 
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for non-auctioned fields in June. 
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American identifiable in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts. 
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service. 
There will be no further bids in Iraq. 
Safety concerns that have been highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have held American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said to become more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves. 
US firms were penalised in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and take more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders. 
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, have been able to conclude the contracts with the ministry. 
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and Conoco Phillips, with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty. 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the this weekend under contracts. 
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has for more contracts, than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home. 
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the road, one of the big players in the world economy and to be a technology power. 
We are convinced that can measure the Chinese companies with its Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq. 
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay to address each Felds to increase beyond the current level.

This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn. 
Saleh al Somali was one of the two Arabs, which, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities representatives in the region have been killed by a number of missiles, on Tuesday her car near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.

The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. fight against terrorism, led an unspecified evidence that Somali led to the dead. 
Somali has been described as a leading military planners of Al Qaeda, headed the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, and to the sensitive nature of the U.S. American air attacks on Pakistani soil.

Leading U.N. envoy in Kabul will resign 
The chief envoy to the U.N. in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election, supported by the U.N. has been tarnished. 
Eide redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. 
The U.N. envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which will start in 18 months, could make other NATO governments to withdraw its forces. 
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
This commitment must be long term. 
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help Afghanistan's in the political transition. 
The troop increase on the military side must meet an increase on the civilian side, he said. 
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family to agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul. 
He said that he wanted the notification of UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon moon pass now, so that he had time to look for a replacement. 
What I have said, is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said. 
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival. 
Mr Ban has begun in accordance with U.N. representatives with the search for a replacement. 
The U.N. representatives say that he is the Swedish Italian aligned with America Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean Marie Guéhenno, who has guided before U.N. peace operations, has taken into account. 
Eide position in Afghanistan has been put to the test, after his former deputy, Peter w. Galbraith, he was indicted in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country to seek and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud. 
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired the - "have undoubtedly mission, because it is already a great deal of scepticism in relation to the international interference in the election ". 
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the effort to coordinate the American-led forces in Afghanistan. 
He also urged that allows the U.N. leadership to his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly. 
Eide said expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and that have undermined the cumbersome U.N. recruitment rules his options, take capable people. 
The U.N. rules are so complex that I since May, he said, was able to hire only one person. 
This is disastrous and must not be allowed to continue. 
US Defence Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions 
Defence Secretary Robert m. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions on Iran, because he did not take part in talks on its nuclear plans. 
Gates spoke during a 7-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development. 
"one of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war's own Unvorhersagbarkeit." 
The Obama government prefers a sanctions package, which aims at military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that could affect some sanctions also ordinary Iranians. 
He said that a "package of incentives and" is necessary, "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons ", because" their people will suffer terribly "from the sanctions. 
On Friday in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences, if its nuclear programme to the demands of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear Überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Iran claims that are to be won the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes. 
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme, and a substantial part of its stores stock enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed would forgo nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor. 
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations. 
Iran, but since that time to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreement - in some cases, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided about whether they should commit themselves to the United States. 
Iran, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had agreed in early October, simply, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, brought together in a way, as it in combination with important additional sanctions on Iran have never, Gates said. 
President Obama has set a deadline of 31. dez. for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton again called "crippling sanctions ", will follow. 
In a statement in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and foundation based claims" of certain members of the Security Council to the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready, the talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution ". 
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki in the morning, before he flew in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with representatives of the Kurdish authorities in Irbil. 
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues. 
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the U.S. plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August, from 115,000 to 50,000. 
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, the acceding Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will your security, your well-being and your autonomy within an unified Iraq. 
We will not leave you. " 
A change in the ageing China 
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them, the thought of that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby means one more tomb." 
These lessons have been learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, which began by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, her response was final and immediately: "At no case ". 
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child. 
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8-month old son. 
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern, who affectionately as "little emperors ", has produced, a population crisis in the country. 
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy in effect, fallen, the UN 
Department for population issues, while the number of population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent. 
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger. 
Last year, 60 Jährige Elder and almost 22 percent of residents reported Shang shark, while the shift-occurring under one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, "in order to help to reduce the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future ". 
Shanghai will soon "as old - but not so rich - such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said. 
A gradual détente 
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one child policy would be the most controversial, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today. 
Couples who violate these policy, must count with huge fines - up on her triple annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in the workplace. 
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, the critical financial pressure on the country's natural resources could be avoided, but human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy. 
In rural areas have some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to abzutreiben. 
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, which unnatural ratio of men to women. 
In recent years have toned down government representatives for population gradually their attitude towards a child policy. 
2004 they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder - and 2007 has been the tone of many hard slogans. 
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the government recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allow couples to have two children, which is a partner Einzelkind. 
Shanghai in July, the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births. 
Posters, belehrten families to have only a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who for a second child, and how we can apply for approval. 
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, in order to couples at home and durchzuschieben sheets under the doors. 
They also asked a question, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child. 
The response was not encouraging, said family planning representatives. 
Disappointing response 
Although officials from a rural town in the outlying areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in requests from couples to see after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts, who want to change. 
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, still only four or five requests per month. 
Unrequited Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 despite the campaign still around 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008. 
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. 
They want to give her the best, she said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and legally permitted. 
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government. 
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible. 
People in the West assess the one child policy 'as a human rights issue, said Yang, an engineer, his wife is seven months pregnant with her first child. 
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child. 
The problem is not simply a policy. 
The problem is money. 
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance. 
Wang, the personnel chief, said that they would like to just one child, because it was also an Einzelkind. "we were the centre of the family and that everyone around us. 
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want this. " 
Chen Zijian, a 42 Jähriger, which includes a Übersetzungsunternehmen, said it plain. 
For parents from the middle class with dual career, in the birth rate is falling, he said, is to be successful and we must be selfish. 
The age group of 20 - to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and does not want a life for themselves, he said. 
A single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents. 
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years. 
Then there is the question - "we must modify its housing" - and the life planning - "If the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery." 
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice. 
Our generation is the first, which has achieved a higher standard of living, he said. 
We do not want too many victims. 
UN group plan to reduce emissions 
By wild posturing and mutual accusations was emphasized by the U.N. climate change conference - until now - has set on Friday with the publication of a document, which is a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future, the greatest burden. 
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide, has both the remaining obstacles, as also shown the way forward. 
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen. 
The text, the U.N. created by a special working group, says about the amount of money, should give the rich countries to poor countries, so that we can meet these short- and long-term global warming. 
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and major emerging countries their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rises should be, the political decision-makers. 
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, John Coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra Club in Washington. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Only document, has put together a 180 -page negotiating text, in order to focus on what the leading climate protection representative come across de Boer, the U.N. has described as "the big picture. 
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, would cut, while major developing countries were to reduce their emissions in the same period of 15 to 30 percent. 
The countries together could reduce emissions by 2050 to 50 to 95 percent. 
The talks on Friday, the European Community has awarded a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, $3.6 billion per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation. 
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week. 
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, the mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, demand, if not be financed by the industrialized nations. 
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush government barely two years ago. 
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take measures, Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders. 
Stern gave its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he Yafei, stating that the leading U.S. climate negotiator either to "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week, that the United States, China, to tackle global warming. 
Now that future economic direction of the world's major powers are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fault lines. 
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps. 
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs for the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved, aggressive, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions. 
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America. 
Some of the countries that are exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, despite the fact that the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case. 
The alliance of small island states with 43 members, has submitted a 24 -page draft Treaty early Friday morning. 
Artur Runge small-scale butchery, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "political pressure on the whole political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India. 
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the issues before the arrival of the government leaders, must be resolved, in order to reach an agreement. 
High-level representatives, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Prime entstiegen their aircraft and around through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to "during the next week. 
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people, daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night comedy shows, where they make fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by E Mail - is already a challenge. 
The intensity builds just: Almost all important ministers are now here on Wednesday and will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen. 
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy of the Organization of Conservation International. 
The heavyweights. 
Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling newly 
Monday morning at 5 a. m., 13 will penetrate a pipe penetrate the darkness to announce a Zugabfahrt, which represents a revolution in transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed commuter train in the country during his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, after London St Pancras 225 km/h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes. 
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter services from London. 
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains ladies and the major urban areas in the Midlands, the north and Scotland to London. 
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car on the national carbon emissions and would reduce the congestion on the roads. 
In theory, believe the three major parties in this vision. 
But the many billions of pounds, which are necessary for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could be in the British high-speed tracks still the brakes. 
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government will present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December. 
This gives it a detailed routes map the next stage of the high-speed rail network. 
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, will pass with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial. 
The free site will outline the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch. 
Hs2 should also be three options for a larger, migrated northwards leading high-speed rail network. 
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. 
The preferred option proposed is a Y förmige route, which an individual high-speed link in the West Midlands. 
The route would share in or near Birmingham and an Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. 
A single line would lead to Scotland. 
"it seems to be the most effective option," said a railway insiders. 
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh at 2 hours 40 minutes. 
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the Reisenden, the London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over a hour to traverse. 
The draft would offer the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km/h to drive, which the British rail network the quickest of Europe. 
The first route was planned in a way that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to be able to drive. 
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the line in London, Birmingham. 
This in turn would mean that would be a terminus in London, could be processed at the 20,000 Reisende per hour. 
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing spaceport would be extended to accommodate the high-speed network. 
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International, or Euston this potential. 
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan, in his opinion, should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made until after the parliamentary elections. 
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections. 
The trains had to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would be the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours. 
This is seen as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be guaranteed, a beacon for the rail revolution. 
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgages for 75,000 pounds Orangerie across a Conservative on 
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of Commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an Orangerie across in which he himself in his house in his constituency build deported.

He was allowed to ask the taxpayer's interest rate rise, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month. 
The leaders of the House of Commons the applications were approved at the time and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, of carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible, ". 
Duncan, one of the richest members of the house of Commons, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton. 
In the vicinity of underlying houses have a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros). 
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the Fees Office, a spending control centre of the House of Commons, agreed that Duncan needed more space. 
He has grown a winter garden last year, in the plans as "Orangerie across ". 
Neighbours described him as a "glass house for entertainment." 
Duncan was also asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges to take on the increased money reception. 
The committee has acquitted him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules. 
2004, Duncan security for a mortgage over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) transferred from his house on his constituency house in London, which he 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament, had bought.

The parties alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, to use their Siegel 
The parties alliance, which is monitored by François Bayrou's party MoDem, on Friday to a tentative takeover of the label, the once by Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and urged him under threat of a judicial persecution, this stamp on a document. 
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take on the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that would not be worthy of François Bayrou, to defend this political legacy, after he would have left the hand. 
The defence minister, whose party partner the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC. 
On the strength of his efforts he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), which has a right to the property of the UDF, since he first hits 2004 in the "National Institute de la propriété industrial" has requested. 
However, the office of François Bayrou's friends supervised parties alliance UDF's silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate, and the ministers and MPs under threat of prosecution a deadline, this code is no longer to use and her to transfer the property rights of the brand. 
They have made in the last few days many statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the parties alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of centrist alliance. 
+ Nouveau together they believed, you have the right to the name of this movement + slogans of today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side to your website to give. 
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party NC, "immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material, as well as by (their) website ". 
They demanded by Mr Hervé de Charette "to the property rights of the trademark of their legal Anspruchsberechtigen ". 
If you refuse, we will take action against you, in order to ensure observance of the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned. 
In their letter they stress that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement and remind you that Morin and his friends "have taken the election" to leave these 2007 to start a competing movement, as it had already done other in 2002, the party "UMP ". 
The party Nouveau centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française). 
The UDF they continue to remind you that the last Congress in 2007, three years of accession to the party MoDem, as well as the creation of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing based movement, has passed. 
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, he has requested the brand name, not for three years a member of the UDF," but the UMP. 
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner, the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves. 
Further to-ing you to bear in mind that this recklessness about to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us but in politics, as well as in life dignified, to make a name for themselves, rather than to try to come out of anonymity, by, fraudulent appropriates a name that you have no legal rights ". 
Case Liliane beds Court: François Marie Banier will be sentenced for exploitation of weakness 
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François Marie Banier, to determine whether he, as the daughter of the Milliardärin Liliane beds Court, has taken advantage of a weak moment of Achtzigjährigen, in order to acquire a portion of their assets. 
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his Star photographs, on the 15th and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a crime which, with a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros. 
This decision means that there is indeed a process in this case, the saga of one of the richest families in France, which is the mother and daughter's and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire, L'Oréal. 
Equally, however, ordered the 15th criminal division a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane beds Court, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors. 
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre's conditions. 
On Friday appointed doctors are a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly know whether and to what times Liliane beds Court may have found in a state of weakness. 
I think that they will undergo these investigations. 
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs beds Court, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing. 
What the lawyer by Françoise beds court Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very happy with the decision of the court. 
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he said. 
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court a criminal complaint against François Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him, to have exploited the weakness of their mother for years to get grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or. 
For its part, has refuted Liliane beds Court has always been manipulated by the photographers, which she sees as a longtime friend. 
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs beds court Meyers initiated legal action would have to check, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle. 
The lawyer of Liliane beds Court on three of his Klientin their solicitor sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which they wrote that she distrusts the husband of Mrs beds Court Meyers. 
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court the following: "could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, until twice a day to Banier wrote. 
Françoise, I have since their marriage never more ". 
The public prosecutor's office of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, especially because has rejected a guardianship judge in recent days, their application to launch a judicial protection proceedings against her mother. 
Liliane beds Court "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection and has no guardian. 
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "said the representative of the Public Prosecutor, Marie Christine Daubigney. 
The court has now decided to make a judgment, after the process on the admissibility of Mme beds court Meyers has taken place. 
Managers revolution or the end of the Strategic early education? 
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence have been in vain... 
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the company vis à vis consumers from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" determines the best, as it was made at the consumer products from the technicians in the station to impose. 
By customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the ground... Although separated the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again! 
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation. 
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects in particular the employees. 
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F, even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence. 
In fact urges the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; they claimed by the staff employed, which the instructions of the authoritarian management. 
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff at the heart of the concerns of the company equal to the customers. 
The highly conditional benefits of internal polls 
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his wage recipients, this revolution in relation to stimulate the management practice? 
I fear that, unfortunately, not. 
- First, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many detours, finally, to do... What it has always done. 
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathology of the power in proportion to the importance of his own failures. 
And, finally, because most leaders-indeed a vastly simplified notion of human behavior. 
Emerged from the large engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic. 
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. American "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media. 
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, an aktuellein Le figaro. Fr survey of Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world. 
The mobilisation factors to identify and measure 
Instead of It is for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior. 
It is, in any suggestion or practice of steering a fundamental Minutes: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means, to a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects. 
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this concept of the motivation of the staff. 
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set Doxa, which allows them through their widely-perceived picture of the company, to assess what it offers them in achieving their life goals. 
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can mobilise the executives of the companies' social services ", to predict and anticipate and invest its human resource management back to the right place. 
So they create a fertile ground for the harmonious development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence. 
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right a 
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, the concept of "just war" has defended against the enemies of the United States. 
The Conservatives, the allocation of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded this time, the speech by the president, the example of the former Vizepräsidentschafts candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin lead. 
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs. 
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary. 
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says. 
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George w. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision from nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. 
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent have in Oslo "very good work" done. 
I thought that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's. 
In some parts of habeich this speech seen as historic, Ginrich said, in the radio show "the Takeaway" was interviewed. 
The former members, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination on the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the United Left ", which the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they were" not free and could not provide a prize for peace, if the use of force would not exist ". 
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George w. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech ". 
In addition, that he himself as "bucks ", as he always does," he said, "as an American President," as he pointed out that the Europeans, "as in a security bubble, which they have not created themselves and for their protection they do not," Gerson. 
Among the few, not convinced former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos." 
To the left of the President of the democratic representatives of Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces. 
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, to justify the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns. 
The press the moderate left, however, remains a praise on the side of the president. 
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker as him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental ". 
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper. 
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama, "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time. 
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement that the supply of Christmas secures 
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions in the streets, and the TLF - the only employers ’ organisation, who stayed until the end - on Friday night to reach an agreement, the strike order and the threat of severe supply bottleneck at Christmas to an end. 
At the signature sitting on Friday evening "welcomed" the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations. 
After a second night of negotiations parted the conducting early Friday morning, in the hope of quickly to sign the agreement at the end of the morning. 
And despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) leave the meeting. 
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 am until the conclusion of the agreement and at 18:00 p. m., the agreement was signed. 
The conflict, "the companies had very much harm" and "it was feared that he would" affect the holidays at the end of the year, Bussereau. 
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport). 
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros. 
"it is not very much, but we are not small children," is the reason Clos (FO). 
The activists are now dependent, not to block the supply centres. 
"it will probably always be some Widerspenstige, however, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added. 
The chairman of the TLF Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement ", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition ". 
According to him, increasing to 170 euros per month for the low and between 100 and 120 euros for the high wages. 
"this agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (understands), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement ". 
Richard Jaubert (CGT), have "an acceptable compromise." 
The agreement also provides for increasing the travel costs by 3% and the objectives of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, the issue 13. monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements. 
M. Bussereau recalled that "the levies for the sum of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment to the bill of the government the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly. 
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate. 
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement, for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that they then applies in the event of an extension by the Minister for the entire profession. 
This will be the case "in a very short period of time," Bussereau insured. 
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure. 
The Association of FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade ", because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised ". 
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to avoid disgruntling the goose eaters to the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra. 
For the Association of Otre threatens the agreement "digging to small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a lot of digging."

In Boissy Saint Léger issued (Val de Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), he would be extra "a year and a half hours earlier, in order to get to work on time." 
The SNCF, which the Reisenden by officials and security forces had planned, pointed out that it is in the spaceport Saint Lazare bottlenecks has come to nothing. 
The RER A or by the SNCF on the line in the direction of Cergy Le skin operating trains came to or went on to the spaceport Saint Lazare, at the end of the Metros.

"we oppose in principle against the closure of the parties. 
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. 
"this decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island.

New Silicon Valley 
For many years it was considered secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible. 
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union constructing a strictly location for secret military research. 
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, as "Russian Silicon Valley ". 
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here. 
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ). 
There were signed several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation ". 
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Bas Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, Frankfurt, Planungsdezernent Edwin black. 
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd. 
Scientific exchange 
It is a continuous scientific exchanges. 
But it is also about economic relations. 
Firms of the FIZ will be on the growing Russian market. 
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany. 
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies. 
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute for electrons technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika , . 
The community was 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for the armaments research has been set up. 
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city ") received its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the are embedded. 
Stuttgart brake 
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can start not high enough. 
For the proponents of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe ". 
Right. S21 is much more than the low Erlegen a station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of the swim württembergischen capital for a decade in mustered temporary chaos. 
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980 s. 
Head stations with tracks, which end up in the middle of the city, were at that time as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19 st century, which acted as a modern rail transport bottlenecks, since it took a lot of time, umzuspannen locomotives from behind. 
In short, drive - to go further. 
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And in Stuttgart: a spaceport, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe ". 
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 80 s are not years longer compatible with the reality. 
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the remarks made and the Bavarian city almost impossible to implement the low Erlegen. 
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since modern turning trains with driving vehicles and tax cars at both ends. 
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed. 
Regional and local politicians have. 
The train makes with, not least because the risks of the largest infrastructure Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company. 
Städtebaulich can justify the project is still reasonably justified. 
New city area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphs of the planners - with a lot of green. 
For the transport system S21 rail is harmful. 
The transit spaceport and the routes development are intended for the transport of persons, which the same huge growth - typically 80 s. 
At that time was not yet the competition from low-cost carriers. 
Modern transport policy must go there is to strengthen the freight transport, because of the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads. 
But the new route because of intense climbs, not for freight trains. 
This is much worse, that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
Good six billion euros will be in the Schwäbischen are buried. 
This is the official number. 
Experts are ten to 15 billion for realistic. 
What is clear is that in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and Engstellen on the network. 
A total of major projects are on the list of the transport ministry. 
One of the most important is the development of the 180 km route through the Rhine valley. 
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion. 
So desperately needed, right here on the tube. 
But S21 will act as a brake. 
The Rhine valley route becomes a bottle neck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe. 
Government is considering verdict on the Airport 
The country's government has left the country Wiesbadener country day whether it against the judgment of the Rhineland Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) will go to the ban on night flights in revision. 
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages VGH judgment legally to verify, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP). 
The Kassel had established on these days in writing that the country in the case of the planned construction of the North West runway at Frankfurt airport should regulate the night ban. 
The admission of 17 flights between 23 pm and 5 p. m., as the country's government, was not with the legal protections afforded the population against noise at night. 
The coalition until 4 January. Decide whether they are against the judgment in revision. 
The opposition criticized the suspension, and by the representatives of the government to abandon a review in the federal court in Leipzig. 
SPD group chief Torsten Schäfer Gümbel claimed the CDU and FDP, to return to their promises made before the election, on a night ban. other case, be it as a "breach ". 
It is hellishly difficult, if We must keep his word, Greens chief Tareq Al Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold word ". 
Prime Posch rejected the accusation of Gümbel Schäfer, try the country's government, with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to come to their night flights. 
A precise legal test need their time. 
The coalition did not on the basis of a "rapid first impression" operate. 
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
So, as the opposition, been the statements of his group's ban on night flights.

Early election 
It was then everything faster than expected. 
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board the editor-in-chief of Santa Claus Brender from office, the station a successor. 
Yesterday evening, wanted to vote on the body on the persona Lie. 
As the favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studios in Berlin. 
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure. 
However, also have played a role, the ZDF Intendanten Markus Schächter should not to further damage, this proposal to the board of directors do not. 
Frey, Schächters candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 council members. 
The outcome of the vote was in print this edition is not yet. 
Two weeks ago was Schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender to extend for a further five years, on the board failed. 
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. brenders dismissal was a significant defeat for Schächter, an erwartbare, however. 
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, not to want to confirm Brender in office. 
Had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch. 
With the argument that under Brender would have lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, has refused to accept another term of office of the highly-regarded chief journalist. 
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated. 
Least had even 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional agreeable. 
To no avail. 
The person 
Peter Frey are scoring was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen. 
He studied politics, education and Romanistik. 
After that, he worked in the South West Funk and the Frankfurter Rundschau. 
1983 changed Frey are scoring on ZDF, first of the "today journal." 
Subsequent ports: 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; by 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine "; by 2001, head of ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of ZDF capital studios. 
The Greens after the dismissal Brenders, announced on Wednesday by the journal medium magazine was elected to the journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint. 
Koch's adversary in the Governing Council, the rheinland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week, the countries should the ZDF international treaty change so that staff proposals of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority. 
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, however. 
Brenders voraussichtlicher successors-have Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - when he criticised the body immediately after the dismissal of Brender. 
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could elect him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without into the suspicion, a partisan office. 
In the party arithmetic will, the left-wing liberals. 
The study will entrümpelt 
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strikes drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday a: a meeting of Kultusminister- and university chancellors conference, both sides agreed that the studies and improve conditions in Bachelor and master. 
The students should be in the future, to be able to handle their studies. 
In individual they agreed to reduce the examination burdens: in principle should each studies module only with a single scrutiny. 
Also the workload of the students and "a realistic and reasonable ". 
Policy and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities inside and outside Germany. 
The countries committed themselves to common structure targets for Bachelor- and Masters. 
Different countries regulations should there not be beyond. 
Less tests 
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture Ministers and Uni vice-chancellors that word of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth. 
Now it was filled with a specific content for the first time. 
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits, in part: "Each module includes, with only one test, it says in a 30 -page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of degree courses in part. 
With the "significantly reduce the examination burden-if ", said the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, should be offered a" trend, which the Studierbarkeit considerably. " 
In addition to the "Studierbarkeit" in the future, "the decisive criterion" in shaping. 
Content modules are like "rigorously checked to see" whether "unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of the 
Events ". 
The students' right to maintain margins, the own initiative and promote ". 
Apply the rules for the authorisation of new, but also in the review of existing studies. 
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "- which means that it will take until 2015, and were reviewed all studies. 
Responsible's ten accreditation agencies, which are the accreditation, created by the countries of accreditation Council. 
The Culture Minister had called on the countries in October "with vigour ", so on the agencies that the abundance of not too big and not the testing regime is far too rigid. 
In individual Länder agreed universities and colleges with the country's ministries have already agreed on appropriate measures. 
As the one country said Rhineland Palatinate for the development of the Bologna process additional funds. 
The money to the universities, above all Tutorenprogramme set up and strengthen studies advice and audit and Auslandsämter. 
Country and universities want to spend for ten million euros. 
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment of the higher education law to parliament. 
This is supposed to be for the conclusion of a studies model only one test. 
The studies should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master easier. 
By the end of next year should be reviewed all studies of the country on their Studierbarkeit. 
On Thursday, the government and opposition had once again on the studies conditions in the country. 
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions. 
The federal Bureau of the Juso university groups, the design of the education policy should no longer "behind closed doors," the Minister and university chancellors. 
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students "have a say." 
Support the future academics by the president of the university chancellors Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting of ministers on Thursday, with which the HRK on a common reform paper. 
The trade union education and science (GEW) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal right to each graduates with a Bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course. 
On the other hand, must ensure the countries that the current generation of students Bachelor tomorrow sufficiently Masters with the best possible conditions studies available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar. 
The countries have to be much more teachers. 
To a freer access to the master, were the Culture Minister, however. 
More than a footnote to Herta Müller 
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which addressed in these troubling Sprachfetzen experience the arrival of dissidents, who won the freedom, but has lost both his language area. 
The 1951 born in the Romanian Banat born Werner Söllner had worked first as Deutsch- and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he more evident in 1982 Frankfurt am Main. 
Söllner is with various literary prizes, 1993 kept the legendary Frankfurter Poetikvorlesungen the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of Hessen literature forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt. 
For considerable außerliterarisches stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files." 
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as internal for the Romanian Securitate. 
Together with some of those present had Söllner 1989 the Germans Sprachpreis. 
The recruitment attempts had secretly, first started in 1971. 
I am, Söllner, "anyone, which opposes attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough." 
The lyricist, Werner Söllner is internal Walter. 
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and the unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors in a case from Romania, the throes and the evil of a political system makes based on surveillance and spying. 
Werner Söllner is, so far after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also victims. 
In his Securitate file internal Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the internal Walter for him. 
He had it in for him at the time sensitive points "herausgehauen, so Markel." 
It is a moral need to make this comment. 
Söllners statement was in the form and unexpected, before this audience surprise is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however. 
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in July, at the time, having their own acts, 914 pages, read. 
The people and in some case, what other name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter second-term. 
Unlike the here now very verfahrenssicheren sighting the Stasi files is dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague. 
A systematic education is counter and has been hampered in recent years. 
A Birthler authority of National Council for processing the Securitate files (CNSAS) was created in 1999, the launch of the acts since then, however, is more slowly. 
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the acts. 
That is the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the Prize winner. 
They have a psychosis, finally, interrogated them only once. 
The infamy of power, said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression. 
Certainly include the case Söllner, as so often the case in relation to publicize guilt, inevitable questions. 
Why only now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge urge-whether rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame. 
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote. 
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League 
It was as if a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party, which had distributed a sporting goods manufacturers Goodies rose, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of a hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class. 
The man with the striking shaven heads was because of him foreign city chauffieren. 
Otherwise he would be able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and Corruption in happiness was the 55 Jährige any more. 
This morning was a pleasant evening, but the work is continuing. 
Or will not get moving. 
In the words of only three days earlier: "we have achieved the eighth final ", namely in the Champions League all-at 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania," but we must not be blinded by the success: there will be a brutally hard fight against the descent. " 
The "much more important task" on Sunday. 
Then, we must in Mainz to repeat the royal class performance in the League of everyday life. 
And once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11). 
Tellers 
The eighth final of the Champions League Hinspiele (16/17. + 23/24 February / arranging re-matches 9/10. + 16/17 March) on 18 December in Nyon scrutineers. 
The joy of winning the commencement of the Babbel successor was up. 
Not only with the supposed saviours, of the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, had given goodwill and game. 
I am on the players and told them that they should consider its strengths, and have, said to be brave souls plumber Gross in these simple recipe for success, under Therapeut Babbel but had ceased to have any effect. 
He has a certain magic, Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which would not have thought possible." 
And Sami Khedira, in the after weeks of violation break thanks to his dynamism straight to the best players on the desk, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to: "He is a man who and requires discipline. 
That is what we need in the current situation. " 
Under Babbel had it obvious. 
The VfB Stuttgart is not on the mountain, warns sports bureau Horst Heldt 
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, constancy. 
How Gross herding players and managers, the victory against an ersatzgeschwächte and completely swamped and deal with the Romanian guests to exaggerate. 
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 will wake up, Khedira. 
And sport Horst Heldt reminded that, although a season goal has been achieved, but is still a long way off. 
We are not yet on the mountain. 
To celebrate it was that Heldt in his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews before the start of the game immediately by to be gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh. 
There are decisions, not the other and not the Jens, countered Heldt the harsh criticism Lehmanns. 
The had been accused of the board leadership weakness and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans. 
And that his free day after games had been deleted, start mercilessly Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy. 
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man. 
They will probably not friends for life, the two forty. 
But they were always bounced back with all other agreed that would have been without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team teaching and vindictive, strong idea. 
Babbel and his assistants "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag, too. 
In the World Cup Fight heavyweight 
Hitziges duel in Bern: continue challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.

The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, the duel before the end of the Klitschko era, but again and again the blows of the world's mayor, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial to the goal. 
Overall, the passive Johnson too little for a challenger and tried only on the rounds. 
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, its blows met the world champion but only rarely. 
Still, he is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoff man in the year 2000, which is Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.

Case Kunduz 
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin said Defence Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar. 
SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor. 
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on air attack by Kunduz has the opposition Defence Minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception. 
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol burden-if trains in September said "knowingly selling ", said Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD television news programme ". 
This has been described as believed: he has lied. 
The order to kill, was in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). 
This is the substance of the report, the NATO, Mr Guttenberg has read, Trittin said. 
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just a destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders. 
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein requested U.S. air raid had been killed or injured, according to NATO investigation report up to 142 people. 
The SPD, Greens and Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident. 
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens Renate Künast. 
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism. 
The chancellor did not to specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan, he said. 
On Saturday, were doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background to the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneider Han and Secretary of State Peter Wichert. 
According to the SPIEGEL have informed the two Guttenberg correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker trucks attack. 
Officially, it was said that they would have denied the existence of NATO reports, and the Minister sensitive details. 
Of the two top officials has, however, that they had the Verteidigungsministerium even pointed to several reports, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel Klein and a Feldjägerbericht. 
Wichert should have asked in a letter to clarify the facts, the Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper ". 
He has so far not received a response, it says. 
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday. 
Dream worlds 
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices who see or hear others do not. 
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between imagination and reality. 
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is in order. 
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden. 
Anyone who witnessed in wax a traumartige conditions, things, others do not see or hear, see and hear in the modern Western world as crazy or, at least as a special drogensüchtig Ling. 
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge. 
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, cow and reality. 
Traumartig modified guard awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case binges. 
Even if may differ cause and effect, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations similar processes. 
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin theme is disrupted and the interaction of various parts of the brain. 
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis. 
The gravity has no power more about him 
The connection of madness and dream has philosophers and doctors since ancient times. 
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861, a "great similarity of misleading one with dream ", Sigmund Freud the dream was" a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a ". 
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning t. transformed into a character. 
His body is developed and quietschbunt. 
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling. 
He senses a kick. 
Behind him runs devil figures with blutroten, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend. 
They chase him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body. 
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio. 
He can no longer, the voices, the attack and insult him. 
Henning t. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet attached to a noose and consolidating them hooks in the ceiling. 
It is rising on a loudspeaker and sets the noose around the neck. 
The. 
The noose resolves itself. 
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "Walk in the clinic and let you cure!" 
Today is Henning t. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years. 
It was triggered by LSD. 
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is a maniac depressed, he takes medication, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia. 
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. 
In the mentality that I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says. 
The deceit images are cruel reality 
As a percent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals treated it as the second most common illness after the depression. 
In a schizophrenic acute psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state of übererregten, the hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution complex. 
Particularly widespread is the votes voices-is - votes, the command, comment on, or dialogisieren. 
Also optical hallucinations are not rare. 
The able to separate what is trivial, the brain can ausfiltern not disturbing signals more awareness is awash with that mission. 
As the dream also opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes. 
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg. 
The schizophrenics finds itself in the middle of it, everything has an importance to him. 
While he in a passive role, he will, as happens in the dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and it cannot be. 
Schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated. 
A reality, is not possible, the medical images are cruel reality, excluded awakening. 
Once seen in the life of a hallucinations to have 
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically." 
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real framework. 
Why does exactly our brains antics, researchers are still puzzle. 
Exceptional conditions can lead in every person that he loses the short-lived reality, says fox. 
But not everyone will develop a climate of fear. 
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants. 
Researchers assume that involved minimal brain damage. 
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain at an early stage of development will, with a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained fox. 
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, the manifestiere not also first over many years. 
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the overdraft is there. 
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, since they intervene in the transmitter system. 
If our brains hot runs 
This nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs, in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs, in order to get, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich caste. 
Whether related images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position. 
Caste collects for ten years reports of hallucinations related phenomena, last year, he has his results in The book "The unreal world in our head" evaluated. 
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also by surprising many other diseases. 
These include mental disorders, such as Border Line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata. 
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people. 
Hallucinations, caste, from memory content, which would normally be withheld. 
They arise if brain parts, in which sensory processed, initially or too little; if our brains hot or, if stimulation lacks-seems. 
Drugs can trigger this state of affairs as well as brain damage or a psychosis. 
But also appeal of withdrawal, stress, love mental distress or other emergency situations. 
Recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life of a hallucinations. 
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah k. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg Vorpommern and visited the school. 
A normal girl, really. 
If it were not for the images and voices. 
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it addresses. 
When he replies, take a look at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys. 
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah k. not dreaming, it knows it. 
It is, they see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank alongside to see or hear. 
They can feel his presence even, at least for moments. 
A pleasant feeling is that, they like the boys. 
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes. 
But she knows that this boy and the other mirrors images in real terms and disappear again. 
At night, are the phenomena mostly worrying-both 
The deceit images are often also a burden. 
If they sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes, because the teachers in their eyes and ears unveils a new classmates, while he explained for all other hör- and visible on the blackboard mathematical equations. 
Are the phenomena mostly worrying-both at night. 
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake dreaming or whether the pictures, which sees them, the Fratzen or the girl of arms and legs, with the bleeding before their eyes open or closed. 
Let me in peace, they are the characters. 
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy. 
Autumn 2009. Sarah k. is now 20 years old. 
She has in the past year the baccalaureate and lives with her friend. 
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped. 
Since it on the Internet to contact the psychologists castes, she knows that she is not stupid. 
Cow is also a work of art out of desperation 
If someone is isolated socially or suffers from stimulus withdrawal, he has, in all probability, after a time, hallucinations, says castes. 
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his Unterhaltung. 
Sarah k., an Einzelkind, had as a young girl, fear of other children, often played them alone. 
Their hallucinations could-along, when they came up with 13, that the man, this is called Daddy, since they can, not their leiblicher father. 
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality-China. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there. 
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, which is why they are so real. " 
Also night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations. 
The hallucinations of healthy are no different from an acute psychosis. 
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in a position to recognize their mere empty words as unreal. 
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability. 
Border state between dream and hallucinations 
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience often, alas, says Michael Schmidt rapier hard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf. 
A psychosis is a heavy, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - cow is also a work of art out of desperation. 
Schmidt rapier hardware has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness. 
Oneiroide are multi-dimensional, detailed Quasi dreams, which the Erlebende for real and he cannot distinguish downstream from the. 
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma- or adjust extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients who experience in full awareness of a motor paralysis. 
By continuing total impotence, for example, if a person is threatened by loss of self- and world, he replaced the real life-threatening situation, through its own imaginary world, the reality is, says Schmidt rapier hard. 
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations. 
Since the deal with a situation in the reality-China is not feasible, a world currency, the real situation will extremism-sleek imagination. 
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning, in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not submerged in a loss of loss. 
Everything is real, later in the memory 
Also the Züricher art historian Peter Osgood Claussen describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book 'change of heart "as a rescue operation of the soul. 
He is 49 years old, when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant posted on travel, while condemning his body to the intensive care unit for maintaining is doomed. 
Claussen visited another in a selbstgeschaffene world, other times and places: he saw himself as bettlägerigen, old man, boarded a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health. 
He lives in the early Middle Ages of nobles who drugs from blood. 
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso. 
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory. 
These internal travel for Claussen differ radically from any dream. 
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience. 
In contrast, the memories from mental travel even after years and in secondary details abundantly clear. 
Clearer and more even than real memories. 
The intensity of the Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt rapier hard. 
Ultimately, show Oneiroide psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal figures of external reality in the guards. 
Any change of status, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung whose, what we term reality." 
An experience which might also be enriching.

Burda 
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years 
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda companies in the hands of his two children, he said the SPIEGEL. 
The holding is to include in the future to 100 percent of the family. 
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term. 
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter the companies, said the 69 Jährige the SPIEGEL. 
The details, we have regulated as a precautionary measure. 
The question of whether they are also active in the company, afterwards. 
The question of whether they are in a position to do so. 
You can easily ask not 7500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient. 
This brings the children, and the company. 
On Thursday burda had announced that he is withdrawing from January by the Presidency, and Paul Berne hard Kallen to his successor. 
The 52-year-old Kallen is a board member since 1999 in Burda. 
First of all, he was responsible for technology. 
Later came with the Treasury's responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances. 
For the first time, is not a member of the family at the head of the Verlages. 
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, which is now 42 years old, died a few years ago. 
The appointment of Kallen is also, "10, 15 years to bridge," Burda. 
The holding should be, to 100 percent of the family, said Burda. 
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said Burda that family businesses folding certain: "It was always families who have been infected by a capital addiction, which have speculated away completely and thought they could rise as a major player. 
My strategy was never the case. 
He had "never world power dreams ", so Burda. 
I do not see as the country's political Präzeptor, as it was Springer, and I do not want in the world league with 'Time' play, these shops have become too big. 
The promises of FonPeek 
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can read only his E mails, without an opportunity to be able to see certain annexes or to be able to surf the Internet. 
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year. 
It is to see on the streets, it is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest. 
In contrast to the smart Phones Peek just cost very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone. 
After the company's success, it has two new devices on the market: one, that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong Gratisservice for data, in contrast to the Peek, which is six times higher price to pay. 
Fonpeek Le Web was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version. 
It has the same borders, as well as his American counterpart, has, however, a surprise. 
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, approximately 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe. 
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have to dispense with all the data, in order to be able to read his e-mails, once you cross the border or if you are desperately seeking a café with WIFI (or a link possibility with Fon). 
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should in fact be possible for a long time. 
It is true that offer some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, in order to be able to read all the fine print. 
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored. 
Apart from half of one's own country has always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so. 
That a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / WLAN) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly, but surely rethink and start to of options to consider how they can use their data network. 
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet. 
Without Vetrag and without snags. 
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month. 
And that is what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States. 
And not because I would like to buy. 
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you. 
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer. 
It would be interesting, to be able to see a computer with the same system. 
The fetish colour of Michelle 
Yellow is without doubt the favourite colour of the American First Lady. 
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, to accompany second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. 
Michelle Obama has taken on both occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain. 
It even goes so far that it had the first sight appears that wanted to follow the first Lady of the United States the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided, the same dress to wear more than one occasion. 
However, the two clothes but very much in the way, from which they are made. 
In Oslo at the inauguration behavior-so-called dress from head and one from gemusterten Samt , . 
Also the accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben. 
Also's hair was different: the hair were put on this occasion as hair wreath tough, with the previous bore the hair. 
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work 
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children. 
Is this result of CSIC study carried out in collaboration with the Institute for women "fertility and career women in Spain." 
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market on the basis of their maternity. 
The study is that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and, if so, what kind of work. 
Those of you who work outside the home, no other activity, only part-time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children. 
By contrast postpone the women with a strong employment, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children. 
"the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the drawing, a figure that has to 4.1 years for women with solid employment increases, which took longer to achieve this and withdrawal-implied and have the first child until much later. 
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of preparedness, "explains the CSIC, Margarita Starkevičiūtė Delgado. 
The level of education is another factor, at the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account. 
According to the poll is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child, the higher the higher the level of education. 
This difference was in the women of the same age. 
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother. 
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women. 
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss even before its first permanent employment and their first child, making it the women with a medium or high school completion exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and then have their first child, Delgado.

The trip is exciting and Vicent neither horrors still Erleuchtungen. 
Except that this book is a köstlicher readers enjoy reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and again and again. 
Here are a few sequences from the book. 
On Albert Camus: "when reading his sides I found that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt, without found words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and innocence without any God." 
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what he's blood, not in his brain, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife, which had nearly killed him." 
On Graham Greene: "Our man was by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, so in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was to arrive in the sky in the face of corruption." 
On James Joyce: "the Ulysses" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summit of world literature, you have to the northern wall, on the wall, again and again and again, the best climber try. " 
William Faulkner: "This was a comical Kauz. 
He said sometimes about himself that he is the legacy of a landowner county and other times, he said that he would be the son of a black and a Krokodils. 
Both dreams, of a certain Gröe. " 
On Louis Ferdinand Céline: This writers took the hideous cry on by a bridge from the personality from Munich, so that his response until well into the night of the 20 st century hallte on his literary manner. This he made in a journey that he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worms-that posterity. 
On Mrs Dorothy Parker: "One day they kniete standing up and nineteenth-century-style: my dear God, please, to do everything in your power to ensure that I finally retire, as a woman."

On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she had always their depression. 
The husband took it with total normality, when she told him that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.

On Pío Baroja: "What made Martín Santos because otherwise, than to try to Joyce in Baroja? 
What intended because Benet, if he is not in the arms of Faulkner? 
What made Cela because, apart from the glory to destroy a person, so that he can put themselves on this pedestal? " 
Cowardly aggression 
My 70-year-old mother was walking last week by our part of the city in the municipality of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years, in addition to her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, which we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue lost him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard. 
Can take it into words, our outrage because it is incomprehensible, where the fun at a cheap's aggression against a small and defenceless animal, which is, of course, should be on the leash. 
The suffocation attack, a woman who cosy top-ranking, these individuals on the basis of the incident, they wanted to chastise; indeed, they feared for their own lives, because if a Wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is. 
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday. 
The dog has geheult all day long. 
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nahgelegenen police service, however, we have great doubts as to whether it will bring anything and in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards. 
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to denounce this incident. 
We cannot understand what needs to be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, of an animal which we love, society and friendship. 
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people. 
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies known today. 
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death can prevent in the event of a motorcycle accident. 
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the safety, the "far more than just drawing up and production of products, which always safer" and reiterated that they help with other actions educational and informative character to come a step closer to this objective every day. 
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' runs, in a first phase posters of over 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the bestmöglichste spread. 
In conclusion, Michelin, stressed that the road safety "is a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they committed themselves as manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles always see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products. 
The sale of small lorries is rising again something 
After almost two years are beginning to see the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel. 
The 9,425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures. 
These good figures are to enjoy, however, only with great caution, because the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, this was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a decrease of 60% on the previous year. 
However, we should bear in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the Gesamtzulassungen this 11 months is still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year. 
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles sold, but this figure but all vehicles that make up the vans market, contain: descendants of passenger cars, Pick required, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis. 
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing. 
So we need to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation. 
In this situation and, unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000 E little. 
This plan is intended not only for individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to a small trucks up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 Ausstoss, must not exceed the 160 grammes per kilometre, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves. 
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses). 
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010 a year, such as the last, for which it with a loss of sales (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%. 
The support in Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty 
As it was the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now happening with the ESP stability control ESP, must auxiliary systems on the brakes in the increase in the European cars. 
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles has set a waiting period until the end of February 2011. 
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, however, can help these braking systems on the basis of their way to prevent many front-rear collisions. 
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers, which recognises the system on the basis of the drivers Bremsstärke carried out on the brake pedal to exercise. 
However, this system that pressure is not until the end. 
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned inquiry, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the toss, not more to come on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force. 
Up to 1,100 accidents 
The Bremshilfe with maximum force in the braking system and reduced the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang traveled by , . 
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten. 
It would be even less accidents - it is estimated that could be prevented every fourth accident involving personal injury - once the so-called intelligent seat-belt reminders popularity. 
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, and at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes. 
If the driver then, helps him the system to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary. 
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the toss is unavoidable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes from, in order to keep the damage as much as possible. 
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January 
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that will launch the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel. 
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, namely that the affected side their consent to each and every point of the plan in advance. 
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first the workers and then the governments of the countries in which there are stations, will be presented, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010. 
Dementgegen GM said that it will in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab. 
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that this is a decision as soon as possible. 
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact. 
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy up Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which the Russian group Conv this means backing, ever stronger. 
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC. 
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold by then, will be maintained. 
Most of the Mercedes-Benz Boxster Spyder 
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used the engineers Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms. 
Order to create something they refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to the aluminium used in this model, as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that were saved another 7 kilograms; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again in 12 and with the slight 19 customs wheels back five. 
Then had achieved by the audiobroadcasting system CDR- six kilos of less and again in 30 through the exchange of door by how many from fuel the lack of kilograms. 
Although he, too, with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK available, the test with a car with 6 current hand wheels, mainly carried out on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig. 
In his behaviour can give him only the note perfectly. 
The reduction of its weight but has not geführtdass he would no longer so sure on the streets. 
Rather, the opposite is the case: we do not have long since probegefahren more a small and easy model, which is also a sense of great security at the curves, even at high speed. 
He is a small athlete, able to make its muscles in a low gear in the required time warm, until we give him the orders, heels, to slow down, to recover and then back again everything from his engine to... 
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything that we suggest it with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise. 
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon. 
An engine Sound for all tastes 
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded and we can still make him with the 'sport' option, as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already in the Panamera for the first time. 
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration. 
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or inconvenient. 
The asphalt on the roads, on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes. 
The electronic assistants had to do on the entire route almost nothing at all; and, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning. 
In summary, we can say that it is an ultraleichtes car, a car, which has a Fahrspass indescribable, as it is rare, and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster Ss. 
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and 70,831 euro. 
Bag Girl ' 
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl camp, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett in the fashion look of "prostituting ", she presented her face with the same bad stubbornly as their pockets of Chanel-wearing. 
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "it Girl ", it is a" Bag Girl '. 
The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel 
The celebrated Caja Laboral, despite the many oddball players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph in 82 - 91 during his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and therefore the first place in its group after the excellent performances of Mirza Teletovic, with eight three times the assessment was the best of his team (29). 
The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, replace Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end on their victory. 
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 countries three times contributed significantly to their final victory. 
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Red, who absconded from the beginning of the to the top table. 
Since the team's first four baskets from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came, it was already appears to indicate that they are on the pitch with good reheated hand ligaments. 
It was English and Teletovic, which were mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter. 
The second quarter was hardly changed, except that the team from Álava for an innenseitiges game of Barac, and for the game by Eliyahu, on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause was received, the home is to be their advantage any further until the break (34 - 43). 
Teletovic began, emphasis as the best of his team with 13 points, wennn the "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of Brazilian. 
Despite the was the game despite the clear advantage in the recess is not long and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of Elías" they came into the game. 
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the fact that the "Yellow" umdrehten (50 - 49). 
Even more disadvantages 
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to regain the air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three consecutive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas that ads on the table again einberuhigender refrain from (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make. 
The Alavesen exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) has already announced that they would allow them the victory, which they had earned in the first thirty minutes honest, taking away again. 
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, not the best of their team, and tried to their team by three points from the line (70 - 77). 
Despite this, and even though mote fouls being sidelined, the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although aufholten the Israelis nor in the last minute (80 - 85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season. 
Injuries prevented that was the Unicaja 
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had the lead in group B of the Euro League to him, and that in a game which, through the failure on the part of the players of Unicajas (Free country, Lima and Archibald), particularly in the domestic game, was marked, which facilitated the Greeks victory. 
The team from Malaga had neither fear the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money. 
Thanks to their game in the first quarter were allowed to dream start the Andalusians. An aggresive Defence and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, ignored the hosts with 12 - 18 in the 9th minute. 
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even if the local team with a home game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads table in the 13th minute anzeigte 22 - 20 in their favor, the minute, in which it on the basis of an action almost to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why they were disqualified. 
The Greek team went on to be finally warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the Englishman Joel Free country on the basis of a violation and the three self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clear traces the Unicaja left. 
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44 - 32. 
A race to catch up was impossible 
The third quarter of the game was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite its 19 losses showed superior and managed, the difference in Malaga most game with 66 - 48 in the 27th minute offset, which in turn the leadership within the group. 
Unicaja tried to find out about the many defaults and the departure of the injured Scots Robert Archibald during the game. 
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31th minute thanks to the leadership and the three times of Cook and the use of Lewis little hope in 66 - 57. 
Despite this was impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed their superiority with centimetres within the basket, was not to slow down. 
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute, the basket difference to 81 - 62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and the leadership of Olympiacos.

However, he tried to obtain refuge in Brazil this week. 
However, this failed Zelayas' refusal to recognise the status of an asylsuchenden politician, the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti case wanted to impose. 
Thank you! 
After the glowing days since last spring, which was the inflation of assets the prevailing mood of the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is certainly not surprising, since this is their natural state of affairs, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future. 
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was with the direct purchase of assets to pay the debt and indirectly the liquidity free rein in interest rates, the move to the zero, so that the banks' assets to the Abrechnen in this way. 
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction, which takes place next week. 
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums. 
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts, which she achieved at the beginning of the year. 
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt will rise again. 
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany. 
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision in the assessment of Spain. 
A degree of uncertainty on the other hand, is not the defenders of the moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action. 
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren, in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast. 
A government which conceals the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction. 
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the external payments saves and thus gives an euro member country no longer meet its obligations. 
It is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek government has to be transparent and its citizens in need of außergewöhnlicchen measures with, in order to maintain the stability of the state money. 
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses on to high amounts, would now within the Erwarteten. 
In the case of Spain must do not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses. 
Should the European differences, and increase the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk. 
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. Forces during the early indicators of a large part of the market research institutes to bring forward their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which, with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come back all this despite warnings not long life span. 
Once again, it appears that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, "caution ". 
Associated industries 
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.

According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain to EUR 2020 50 billion and invest another $60 billion from that date until 2030, under the entails that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation. 
Should this not be the case, the necessary investments to $60 billion, but up to 95 billion. 
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that you should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings. 
The issue will change from 2020, and we should increase the performance. 
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to sterilize the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy. 
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 MW more, under the will of course by other "Stützenergien." 
Galán, who is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say in no case against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which is the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change. 
In his opinion, "in the long run, evident in this direction, despite some" individual "measures, such as the chairman of Iberdrola. 
It says Galán, that the decisions on the investment, even if they are, in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created, in order to get through it.

The League has, according to the UEFA up to EUR 5.362,5 million of the 105 teams (12 Spanish), which since its founding in the season 1992/1993, distributed. 
Real Madrid and the f. c. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.

The President-in-Office of the Catalan champion and the winner of the former Europacups 1992 ranks the fifth place. 
The list of Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, which also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.

On the other hand, is only the third countries, Spain, by the Champions of money einehmen, although it has more titles than any other (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany). 
Distribution

The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the Second, the 5.2 million. 
So gets a football club at least 7.1 million and 31.2 million in fixed income. 
Barça again earned with his victory in the European Super Cup in August 2.5 million. 
However, the variable payments, are scheduled for the 337.8 million.
