Knows what he will do? Social Democrats in Prague Voldemort or the candy store
New the City Councilman from Social Democrats will have to overcome a language barrier, according to all to in the Council, and in the site understanding of their staronovým colleagues of the ODS.
Journal told members of the new Council of Social Democrats "felt," as they know the notoriously introduced slang, which ruled the city began during the last few years, when Prague the current coalition partners.
Coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political royalty during the previous era Mayor Paul béma, describes the some of the most famous figures, the situation and kauz in the city.
Surprisingly showed that new Councilman known concepts too do not understand.
At least it says.
"Who is he?"
"I don't know."
"I'm in a Prague talking about policy," Councilman responded to the test "kmotrovského" vocabulary for culture, kaucký.
Reacted as well as Councilman And though a political veteran Karel Březina.
To be on the concept of "Golf well."
"It is the only expression of those, what you are giving me who sometimes I use."
"otherwise slang in general I recognise."
From the vocabulary, whose terms told Journal published in June this year before the election Congress ODS, selected office six examples, mainly those which are notoriously linked to Prague Town Hall.
The Socialists should explain the terms "Voldemort," "the greatest golf tee in Prague," "go to the candy store" neck, "bull" the city, "treason" and "oplechovat."
Three of the councillors agreed with kvízem, fourth - antonín weinert, which has run the show pražskému education for the future - first conversation promised, later, but he did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilman Peter dolínek straight test refused.
"These things don't care at all and enjoy it as the Civic Democrats, I'm not evaluated."
"I now covered here, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he responded.
How has already been said, Councillor, kaucký, caption in the supposedly couldn't tell that we are talking about the influential businessmen and friend exprimátora béma Romano janouškovi.
"Voldemort" kauckému him nothing, and only the date that the test correctly guessed, is "the greatest golf tee in Prague."
"It is tunnel Blanca," says kaucký, and now it adds: "But I know more of the paper."
"I will have to pay some language course, he" joke.
Golf swing then as a tunnel Blanca management dešifruje not only matador Karel Březina, but Councillor for the environment, shy.
Both the Social Democrats then know who he really is, and lukáši plachému is familiar and it, to find where this character - suspect the importance of the term "to go into a candy store."
"I think that's what he's doing is to go to some of the Prague undertaking," is a shy close to the explanation that the headquarters of janouškových firms.
Equally with březinou recalls that knowledge of the načerpal from newspapers, rather than to that language used.
In the social democracy according to frekventantů test there is no similar to a familiar vocabulary slang terms.
"I advised with colleagues, but it seems that really have nothing like this."
"We say more names, sometimes use abbreviations and distortions," says the president of Prague Czech Petr hulínský names, which straníci přezdívají hulda.
Birch "on the school have said to me, but I don't know if I even colleagues say so," according to its own alias Charles Březina.
Journal tried told the name and works.
Councilman weinert is for straníky Grandpa or less friendly old man, zastupitel Miroslav few weeks, which in itself pointed out before the election fraud in sponsoring the nickname "igráček," has for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in the vnitrostranické speaking permitted.
Hulínský they can't hear huldu I, however, told Journal, and another nickname of this of Prague.
"Dr. obuškového rights," he points out that Petr hulínský won his title judr. at Bratislava Police Academy.

"The existing rent is still less than the necessary for a simple maintenance of the stock," recalls Paul Klimeš, Director of the rezidenčního portfolio companies RPG flats, that this is a very sour tenants vytýkaná neglect of the housing stock, is to homeowners the main reason for the increase in the hiring.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 could RPG from the hiring of investing in apartments four billion, for four years from it by the year 2014 has be 5.2 billion by 2011.

Fascinated by House of bones and after 100 years. Look at the Interior from gaudího
Roof looks like a back pravěkého lizards, staircase reminiscent of the backbone of dinosaur and balconies are Open of the mouth.
This is the House measures to Casa batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect antoni gaudího.
From local house because of its organic shapes commanded the House of the bones.
Organic shapes, colors, unusual use of rock debris kachlů wild and Mosaic, the facade of scales, and the presence of soft lines, all of this is typical for secessionism antoni gaudího.
The front of the house of one's the quarterback fantasy line, gentle color and texture of nature and animals.
In the detailed observations is seen geometričnost rhythm and precisely measured order.
In the night the entire House facade is even more dramatic, is even umocněn Rightwards, so that was the impression the glamour of colors.
Winding and twisting forms with the equally discovered in the interiors.
Wood in the waves of copying the window frames, rail, decorative elements of the door, watches and bar.
House batlló, which stands in the eixample on the busy shopping street passeig de grácia no. 43, a house from 1877 conversion from architect, Emilio Sala cortese.
Reconstruction was conducted two years and was completed in the year 1906. The House
Investor, a wealthy industrialist, Josep batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of old buildings and creating a completely new, but soon adopted gaudího idea for an unusual and cheaper converting.
Apartment house Casa batlló but antoni gaudí did not suggest himself.
Architect, Josep Maria jujol cooperated with him.
On his projektantském base arose just decoration for representative apartment owner of real estate and use of the facade.
On the facade worked and a number of other creators and artists.
The joint work on the proposals of house Casa batlló started a successful cooperation jujola with gaudím.
Jujol was involved in construction of gaudího House Casa nice and park güell, in which there are other gaudího works.
From the local house soon after the commanded by its organic shapes the nickname "house of bones."
Others him due to the specific mechanism of the opening windows started to "zívajícím house."
Says also that on top of the building is vypodobněn sword St George, the patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include the other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house proposed to its time unique central heating system with odvětrávacími vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový tilt.
When drafting the gaudí totally ignored the tie the building codes and never let them down.
At the beginning of the building had gained from the city of building permits, but it referred to information on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing was the result of'm horrified and asked to repair city council.
Local councillor mind, for example, that the construction of running pillars and to the public the sidewalk.
To remedy the never took place, on the contrary, just 15 days after the call of urban areas, Josep batlló applied, and successfully won permission to lease the two top floors buildings.
Himself owner moved into the lower levels.
In the gallery in the second floor was social salon and in the third floor bedroom and private parts of the apartment.
Ground floor was been let jewelry shop.
The šestipatrový House cuts staircase, which can rise to the roof terrace.
Major elements of the reconstruction was the abolition of all the right angles and direct lines and their replacement of the curving walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of linking space.
Social part can be salonních opens the door completely link and greater company can comfortably communicate together, and he wouldn't at the same time her privacy needed for intimnější talks.
House with gaudího conversion, moreover, in addition to new facades of also unconventional roofs and two floors.
Impressive is also gaudího game with light blue and white glazované tiles, one which is internal auditors, and skylights.
Game two color, adds maximum of light in all the floors of the House.
Enough simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light more than dark, which the sun's rays, on the other hand, drains.
House Casa batlló, which was in the year 2005 included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund, each can visit.
In the first floor of the house is most spacious and nejhonosnější apartment made available to the public.
Owners decided, for this step to in the year 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of one hundred of birth famous artist fiftieth anniversary.
For the controls remained, as they found, that it is a very beneficial business and, moreover, surveys of extended on the common and 6 spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monuments certainly is not insignificant, is 16,50 euros, pensioners and students, groups and tourist průkazek holders have 20% discount.
Sum greatly exceeds the price of vstupného to other gaudího buildings in the city.
If you want a taste of the mood of the house with dračími turrets, you need to quickly make friends with some of the residents of the house and to visit him right at home.
How to choose the mattress requirements and grid: women have other than men
Not so grand bed frame, but the quality lehací area, mattresses and grid, give the basis of really good bed.
But must be harmoniously complement, to suit the specific users.
In selecting decides lots of things, from the weight, height, age, health and gender owner.
Type of Interior is also essential, in which the mattresses and grid are buying.
A typical example?
To be on the weekend cottages, where isn't regularly, are not appropriate latex mattresses, because the more slowly "heated."
Moreover, have significantly higher than standard weight polyurethane mattresses.
Yet is to be regularly call.
Because if they have a lot of the dump pipes in the heart, and is still lies on the Solid board holds moisture: could the rot under them appear.
In selecting Decides also habit.
Who spent long periods of time in the state, where often used a lot of high mattresses změkčující layer, will find it hard to feel good on low and with the hard surface.
"Perhaps all hockey players from, who were returning from the NHL, had me complained that there is any sleep."
"At His battered the shoulders, heels and hips needed změkčující layer lazy foam mattresses."
"Such recommend even for people with diabetes, who have a breakdown of the nervous system, so badly takes over, the information" from the joints and skin, "explains sylva hadamcziková, which is on the upholstered furniture specialized.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers because years ago sent mattresses with lazy foam.
"Now it's okay, appropriate mattress has to be tempur, Italian magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a guy from the NHL to appreciate lazy foam.
The "miracle" works simply.
Optimize your stiffness and according to the absorbovaného heat or to adjust to your warm form.
Nothing pressing you, at night, you won't tip, as after the game.
You just better sleep.
Lazy foam it works as a protection against proleženinami.
In selecting size mattress to their height add length of feet, which is more about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm and in need of bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum for one should be in dvoulůžka 90 cm, together so 180 cm.
In separate beds, such as the singlistů, recommends at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Otherwise, it is a rule to the bed simple: while lying on his back, YOU SHOULD HAVE hands comfortably slightly bent in the elbow," says Ing. Helena prokopová čalouníků Guild, cechmistryně sleeping and dekoratérů, which is the issue of a healthy and ergonomie furniture pays for a number of years and he teaches her on professional schools.
In dvoulůžka needs each own grate and mattress, but watch out here in the purchase of mattress, to reconcile height.
Wrap grids in different heights, otherwise will be nothing other than what you have, however, for each of the frame of the bed may fail.
Foam mattress should have at least 14 cm in height, with spring skeleton at least 15 types, of which at least three centimeters count on forming and raising layer.
"in the hands of contact or dosednutí a mattress spring definitely don't feel," Helena prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Celočalouněná when beds, mattresses and support, as srostlá Siamese twins, do not have what to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses wrong větrají, cannot wash their skin, which already today is normal.
And because a night normally vypotíme 0.2 to grapevines sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years mattress will start to a very big, and jammed a sieve.
And therefore, experts reject advertising slogans on the life of the mattress to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantees.
However, everything has its but.
And that is why the Council of practice from vendors: the mattress with a 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work snímatelný film, but add, a rather mattress buffer, which you cannot give in easily take and wash.
Even if today normally produce mattress covers we get zdrhovadly around the perimeter, so after opening two parts, for money and size of washing machines a lot of important!, yet could handling for the larger types, and when one man in the scan to fight easy with heavy weight in the ring.
You are in bed instead he slid a record?
Never!
Maximum on the bed intended for visit in one night.
Record, however, yet, if it is no longer has of the air vents and use the mattress with spring skeleton and height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags, from něm.taschenfederkern and raising layer.
Polyurethane mattresses on this basis does not belong.
On the nepolohovací laminated grids 14 to 18 lamelami latex will be appropriate or sandwich mattresses, to be a combination of latex and coconut, but you always pays the grids with larger numbers of lamel, 28, and more, where vanes are in the field of European double and it is possible to regulate their stiffness.
On positioning laminated grids are not mattress with spring skeleton, because the positioning unresponsive.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel can afford even the shoulder the cradle.
It is a special fixing the lamel, which allows push, or even dip lamelu, so as to shoulder a the sleeper "stabbed at items of particular interest."
For men, who have "shoulders through the back" certainly an important thing.
Even remember her mattress and producers, who already in "mens" began to use změkčující zone just in the area of arms.
On the women also remember - those they softer surface again in places hip surgery.
For the most demanding customers are intended křidélkové or destičkové grids with the multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure is to more points and reduce tensions.
But watch out, as soon as you use a mattress and the bad pillow, a large and "naducaný," most of the "plus" disappear.
Basic rule is simple: pillow has support head and on its back with arms, so that they can only intervene to release the shoulder muscles.
As an appropriate size recommends 50 x 60 cm, which prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
In lying on the side of balance would have a pillow, together with the cradle of, or změkčenou zone in the mattress height on the shoulder.
Modern mattress have with the original slamníky plněnými grasses there is something to do.
Their producers, are increasingly using natural materials or at least matter.
BIO trend is just and with the mattress.
Raw materials from oil, of which are producing polyurethane foam, are replaced natural oils, for example, from skočce and soya.
Just soybeans used almost all known producers.
"Bio mattress for means that core is made from material purely natural origin," says Peter vašíček from companies Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are used in the manufacture of blankets mattress as well, one of the first was aloe vera.
But take you can even mikrokapsle to you uvolňovala fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also the Division for men and women.
While the men "Cooling" herbal extract from of to skin mattress absorbed heat and cool body, women, on the other hand, covers "drowning."
Extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it is weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Foam mattress made from the cold, has more pores with a cellular structure is so prodyšnější than the normal polyurethane and offers a better elasticitu.
A combination of various tuhostí cold foams and "lazy" foam arise vícezónové mattresses, which they know exactly where it should be head, shoulders and heels.
You'll pay for quality mattress so from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical equipment.
As the first reached in the Czech Republic on this advantage of the gumotex.
Save on a mattress and grid is not easy.
Sometimes can be used to be actions producers or vendors, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
To mark magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with všitou memory foam memory in the skin for 11 990 crowns.
The other can, of course, is a free of charge.
Lazy or viskoelastických foam with the open era cellular structure and the high density of started "The space" at a rate of material tempur.
A originally as material for NASA, because in the startech astronauts were subjected to enormous congestion.
Tempur in warm soften, in the cold, on the contrary, zpevňuje.
Warm the human body is so perfectly, adjust and dismantles optimal its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against a proleženin, but also for the comfort of while sleeping.
Viskoelastické foam used not only the mattress, but also for medical products, should be at the special pillows under his feet, which odlehčují feet and žilnímu system.
Domestic producers used, for example, foam eucatherm C or twinsaver and the like.
Apparatus on monitoring people want more and more parents, that they prepare their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of patrol over GPS.
System originally made for search for the cars they may follow the movement of people, and this assistance should be in such cases, which is the disappearance of 9-year-old aničky janatkové.
Device is about the size of a box from matches so far, but may be just a big watch soon.
A number of people said the case of missing aničky and began to better protect the quest for resources, as their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
"We have to say that it is not about spying, but on the other means to reduce the probability, that it would be a tragedy," says Peter bits of wood from the company, Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in a case can be the abuse of such equipment, like to be in the bag when someone who knows about it, but even with such a case we had."
"Most of it really customers are buying for security reasons," he added bits of wood.
According to him, always child should know for what purpose "box" used and how to use in case of an emergency.
Child Psychologist Dana bočková draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to wear anything like it, just get rid of it.
"And very small children show great creativity in it, as some things on purpose to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations of earlier on parents' cell phones, which are, however, put off as well as the surveillance equipment," says bočková.
According to her, it is also questionable whether would help in case of attack really such a device.
"If it comes to the kidnapping, it shall be the perpetrator virtually always, to child with him had no electronics, which could reveal his position."
"Now it's phone."
"When they grow a tracking device, will look for and it is, because their sales will certainly supported by a massive advertising."
"In this case, will be criminals always one step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
Acknowledges, however, that such a device may help in the case of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert čecha from company RC monitoring, which offers tracking service for cars, as well as for persons, and in the case when it comes after the assault for the immediate destruction of surveillance equipment, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to regular sending position after a certain period of time."
"the damage if there would be, will be available for at least the last position of the person concerned."
"More expensive equipment have incorporated and náklonometry, so even if one only slipped and he remained motionless, will send machine immediately warning of an indication of position," says of Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service may divert the smart mobile phones with the navigation, where just load and special software.
Problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either an apparatus similar přívěskům box from matches or the smaller size of mobile phones.
Always so threatens their loss.
According to the pilina of macro Weil, so therefore now testing equipment looking like normal digital watch.
"It will have the biggest advantage in the fact that any aggressor does not even recognize a tracking device."
"or is known to after some time and it can give police the extra time," he added.
Whether a tracking device put in the bangles or přívěsků still will use the same technology, which is used for patrol cars.
It is a combination of positioning via GPS system, which used the normal autonavigace and the features of a mobile phone, which current position of the reports.
Army has burn it lines that would obmotaly the Czech Republic. But only two years
The Czech army bought 445 miles lines, which are firing explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence gave the, to 224 miles lines.
Army has provisions for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of lines is two, up to four years.
Army fuse just bought from the stock stv GROUP a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff in the justification for the purchase of such a huge quantity of ignition lines MF wrote, that soldiers in training today consume 60 kilometres of detonating cord per year.
Of the calculations of Army mine clearers, which MF today then it would be very intense pyrotechnickým training, she said, however, it had to pass through every year and all the generals, officers command of the army, the secretaries or cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexander vondru and the chief of the army vlastimila picka including.
Only then would be justified annual consumption of the army of 60 kilometres of detonating cord.
This length of responsibility of 25 thousand blasts.
And even if it really was, stocks of the army would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, would be true, that is enough to basic training of each new professional not more than two meters of fuse just, say experts, as well as the army fresh buying ensure - even with increased consumption of ženijních or special forces - stocks on the 225 years.
Soldiers brigade Rapid Reaction, Minister vondrovi recently personally complained that they had almost no bullets to small arms fire, so there are also restricted because of short of money.
About the lack of underwear to say nothing.
"My head, it does not take that you buy from us repeatedly so large amounts of detonating cord."
"But it is their decision and will know to what they will be."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which, as traders trying to comply with," says Sales Manager stv group, Jan děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan pejšek justifies hundreds of miles purchased cord and that the army will have stocks of this "munitions" at least ten years.
Jan děcký squib and life of stv group, however, only talks about the four police or army Bomb Disposal Unit even only about two years.
"In a perfect storage it may be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier because of criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
, each bombs must carefully life after the test, whether it is more reliable and does not harm soldiers to life.
But these tests are not free of charge, and it costs more money.
Another argument is Bulk discount department to 445 miles of ignition lines.
"cost us about 60 percent less than last year's delivery of the two hundred čtyřiačtyřiceti miles," it conveys a buyer pejšek opinion Department of Defense spokesman.
Only for comparison: annual consumption launch lines of police mine clearers who destroy ammunition from the Second World War, or here after the Soviet Army, does not exceed 1 500 meters for several years.
And police orders always just such quantities to this ammunition or even before the expiry of life.
Works it because of the safety of the mine clearers, and may also more flexible to obtain more modern, and, therefore, more reliable types of lines.
The Defense Ministry has already considerable difficulties in cleaning the tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the dvousettisícová Czechoslovakia's army preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
The Czech according to mine clearers which addressed MF today, waiting for a few years, the same problem: will destroy hundreds of miles of detonating cord, which now "cheap" buys.

Winning a place in the competition helped the trafficker of lukáši pytlounovi in sale franchise with his hotel.
Winner last year of competition trafficker year became the osmadvacetiletý businessman Luke Bagman of Liberec.
His success story is like a film.
Luke Bagman I traveled.
And in the foreign country realized, that is lacking in Liberec quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
Brigades of savings from foreign and using bank credit polorozbořený bought the house with five apartments.
On that, that was a student of the third year of high school, it was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and price of accommodation for US gave me, I tried to do something," says Luke Bagman in it.

All invested back into the house, which gradually redesign the profits to pension with 54 beds.
Since then he managed for seven years of business gradually in Liberec open four guest houses, two stylish restaurant and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds all categories of accommodation.
Comfortable of them was recently about Bagman design of the hotel.
This year but at the next to him, as good.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in the island in the tisé, where we sell our franšízingový concept and other bidders for franšízu hotels Bagman reporting," says last year's number one trafficker.
"and was a great role in the sale of the licence to run a hotel just Bagman trafficker victory in the competition of the year," adds approvingly.

"It's not far from only my personal success, it is a result of good work of all of us together."
"Just My name is vystrčeno to the fore," says modestly Luke Bagman today.
I wish my successor calmer year than we have in the farmetu
Euphoria in the victory of quickly gave way to the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the cílevědomosti winners, however, has farmet worse times in a row.
For the price for first place in the past year of competition Vodafone company of last year in the Slavic House had the company owner farmet, Charles žďárský.
The jury then appreciated efforts, through which built from a small nástrojářské workshops in the Czech skalici company stamilionovými turnover.
"I can say that the award was not only me, but all my colleagues and increase the US confidence for the game with the competition," says today, last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when state offered Father Charles žďárského to rent a dílničku as compensation for the communists did not hesitate, refused to zabavený property, long career at the company, where he worked, and then, with a couple of friends around his dad founded the company on a plastic tub.
Soon later started to specialize in presses vegetable oil.
After 18 years of them became the largest producer of automated press in Central Europe.
Greater awareness, and between the neodbornou public company received the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have seen the farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that cooperate with the company, which has achieved major success," says Charles žďárský in his country.
Last year, however, was not in the farmetu only in a sign of the euphoria of vítězsví.
Awards was based on the economic results of the company by 2008, and only in part of the year 2009.
And is the year 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of goods.
During the height of the crisis, which has still never touched so many people, but they companies have stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchases of new machinery and technologies.
"This situation is, of course, no to us."
"sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce the production and there was even in the fire," explains Charles žďárský.
Sometimes viable company must be able to do and such unpopular measures.
Situation but managed and keep the firm in profit, even when less than before the crisis.
But from what in the farmetu neslevili, is investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built Research and Training Center, we have strengthened the presentation in International Fairs, received the award in domestic shows," says žďárský.
All the evidence shows that the crisis is for them.
Sales are rising again and with them, and the number of new employees.
"The new winners have a wonderful sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," said Charles žďárský.
Survey, which removes the nonsensical rules
Survey on the absurdity of the fourth is part of the tournament.
Some nonsensical Legislation has now been abolished.
Neslavným winner of another year of absurdity a year is obliged to wear on the authority of the documents, which are also accessible officials online.
Decided that more than a third of less than four thousand voting.
Such as Social Security Administration required a paper listing of the commercial register, even if it can get the two official kliknutími mice.
Thanks to a survey that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration listing of the Commercial Register in checks for paying premiums already require won't be," said a spokesman čssz John buraňová.
Light up on all the rules and regulations, which must implement companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic, and the ridiculous cancel is the competition absurdity of the year.
This is the fourth time this year part of the tournament with economic newspaper and among the public is increasingly popular.
If the vote last year in about three thousands of voting, was nearly four thousands of them this year.
And it is no surprise, various legal obligations, which serves only to delay the business, is still pretty and enough for us.
"We should be in the number of sheets of paper for tax return to the top in the world," notes to Charles havlíček of Association of Small and medium sized companies and businesses of the Czech Republic.

Competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in the year 2006, and each year in accordance with the same scenario.

Log on to use Web address www.firmaroku.cz then host the competition has seven candidates to "anticenu public" and allow for it in the course of the October vote over the Internet in the pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity, that gets the most votes wins.
To this year's polls has been recorded more than a hundred, at least 105 legislation and regulation lacking sense.
Tips sent entrepreneurs, but also of the professional unions and journalists.
Between "the finalists' competition, and between the nominovanými found itself, for example, a requirement for trucks for the maintenance of Highways and speed roads paid tolls, or to entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets painted every two years.
List of this year's seven proposals will be made public on the pages of the competition.

This year, for example, the culmination of competition, Eva I, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic or Petr cone, President of chamber of the Czech Republic.
"economic prosperity cannot work there, where the state impedes entrepreneurs sticks under the legs, therefore, it is my intention to cancel at least three each year tens of paragraphs, which only needlessly complicate business today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin doll.
Trying to interfere with absurd regulation nevyznívá fell flat.
In the year 2007, most people I do duty entrepreneurs report the three days ahead živnostenskému office in the place where there is a permanent exhibition or establishment, intention to stall the journey.
This duty was deleted Amendment the craft of the law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in the year 2007, which has been reporting office work for its foreign employees a business trip to the extent of up to 30 days, the Green Card was deleted law.
And for the third time all good.
Absurdity of the Year 2009, the regulation fyzioterapeutům have happened in the office large mirror, a refrigerator and two land weight.
It was in the year by decree the Ministry of Health mitigated - to have a refrigerator was cancelled.

Although the subject of their activities from one of the very different, as the common denominator their efforts can be seen support and consideration.
In one case relates to the affected people and elsewhere to be of personal problems, for example, or health own employees.

Another example Pardubice Regional responsible companies from the company is isolit-bravo, which is the main contributor nadačního Fund sponzorujícího handicapped children for 17 years.

On pozemkovém Fund in Plzen police arrest in public competition
In the building of the Liegenschaftsfonds in Plzen police arrest the anti corruption in recent days.
Irons detectives engaged our local entrepreneurs in the media sector and businessman with realities luboši G.
The allegedly tried to manipulate an ongoing public competition to settlement of pending claims for restitution distinguish, so as to give specific lead land offered in the competition.
He had to pay for it luboši G. half a million crowns.
"As far as I can only confirm, one person for an offence that followed the police control in public order and in public competition," said law for the Prosecutor's Office head Antony Green, on the pretext that he cannot provide other details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs police release after 24 hours to freedom.
About that, how could influence public competition, can only be given the low point official information to speculate.
Spokesman pozemkového Fund lubomíra black on the law, said that the police odloučeném the workplace in Plzen really zatýkali, and it during a public competition.
"It was a client, not of our employees," said.
Public competition is in black the name "the challenge to the tender of transfer land according to the Law on the land" and held in the case, when a offered the show interest in more qualified applicants.
"These persons in the framework of the challenges offer higher value of their pending claims for restitution distinguish, which are to be transfer settled, than was announced the value of the land."
"according to the offered claims lays down the order acquirer and transfer Land Fund then the person, which offered the highest claims," the spokesman explained.
Luboš G. was probably Information, who came to the challenges he entered, and because he is also the competent person, because it bought a number of pending claims for restitution distinguish offered candidates on the land, not that the competition.
It seems that for money out severance pay.
This would explain that he was in detention in a large sum of money.
Luboš G. superior contacts on the PF in Plzen should have been in the past.
There were in the case, former head of PF of Vaclav sankota, who was prosecuted for the fact that giving in alternative restitution land, which had already been issued a decision on the location of the buildings.
Just then won Luboš G. from the Fund, for example, the land for the construction of public infrastructure, specifically in the place where the should build arrival thoroughfare in the industrial zone minibar field.
Later, is very favourably směnil the town hall for a house in the historic centre of the city, which was much higher value.
Then on City Hall had to do that, because otherwise it would blocking land construction threatened.
Households on the housing připlatí hundreds per month
Households will have to from January připlatit not only for all types of energy, but also for water and stočné heat supply and somewhere will rise and rents.
Families as they will have to from January out of the pockets to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity rates to go up to about 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, to the tenth of in some cities will have to připlatit for the supply of water and mnohde also podraží supply central heat.
Hike electricity should households in the homes out stokoruny more expensive than a year now.
Electricity prices force, all the major contractors cut, so it is a significant increase in aid to blame production from renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaics.
While gas rates to go up slightly, but at a time when people most drowning and have such high consumption.
So a year should also provide, in addition, hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and gas price rates to go up after all over the country, the change in the central heating, different place from the place.
Price increases are planning mainly more municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kralove pay from January for the extra central heating about 50 crowns a month, about more than 1000 kroner a year will pay the families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague again threatens to them by more than 9 percent rates to go up water rates and stočné, and that in the event that the city will increase the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent will not change, připlatí roasted 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
On the north Bohemia, where prices are among the highest as of now, has a water rates and stočné podražit by 7.4 percent.
Can significantly increase of rent prices in 450 thousand rental apartments, where, for example, from January end of regulation.
, for example, CPI flats, which in Usti nad Labem own about 2,500 apartments, intends to from January rent increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree to a new amount of rent, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated rents, which pay people in about 300 thousand apartments, could rise as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech opíjejí children fernetem and rum. beer is out of fashion, he slowly
Fernet rum, vodka, exceptionally, better label whisky stolen parents.
That are drinks, after which drink it in most often end in the care of doctors drunks, which has not yet been or fifteen years.
Children are not the exception, which are treated from monkeys in hospital repeatedly.
This stems from the experience of doctors, who are with similar cases on revenue of Children's Department of hospitals.
"Some kind of beer or wine, are completely nemódní, because it takes a long time to opijete them."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said law Chief of Children's Hospital hořovice department in central Czech Republic vice pelikán.
"If they can pull daddy of the closet, so it is to be a bottle of whiskey, otherwise, but the fernet and vodka."
"vodka has the advantage of that to pour into the juice and it is not as feel," said the chief of them then.
And for the right gives him a University Hospital Motol Eva jurinová spokesman.
"It is most fernet or rum at all."
"It is a modern alcohol particularly on the basic schools today."
"In some cases, it was a slivovici, which brought from home," said jurinová.
According to the chief surgeon's pelikána are 13 or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in a hospital income relatively normal phenomenon.
Before hořovicemi where there are from this year, worked for ten years just to pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances svážejí podroušené school children from miles around.
"One girl was about four times with us."
"career started in 12 years, when it brought to us with 3.5 per mille alcohol in his blood, in combination with ecstasy," described the doctor, particularly serious case.
"was on the exhibition in holešovicích to a dance party."
"It is interesting that her mother didn't seem special, that did not know about their daughter 48 hours at all," said Chief.
Just disregard parents or even their considerable tolerance to carousing own offspring is considered to be the main cause of the growing of children's pijanství.
About dependence in the true sense of the word, however, according to experts on children can talk.
"under the alcoholic refers to několikaletá chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena, which belong to this, and it is not for children."
"For those that alcohol use, is more significant mythic Greek rodinně-sociální background repeatedly," said Chief pelikán.
According to the spokesman jurinové pediatric clinic in Motol committed in the middle of November this year at about forty intoxicated children.
In the statistics, however, they only get you, with heavy intoxikací, which had to remain in hospital.
Child drunks, which, after the ambulantním treatment to drive parents or is home to the police, was not counted.
Except in cases where children just sit up after school drink and a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations, according to pelikána on which they can do: witch, end of year and the end of the school year.
"This either celebrating sorrow for the poor report card, or vice versa celebrating the start of the holidays."
"But the witch, I experienced on income and seven children's drinkers at the same time," said pelikán.
Drunk who spends the night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, in contrast, is, paradoxically, the advantage, which have the second day at home continued to suffer painful hangovers.
Early morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, drives away the irrigation catheter with glucose. And nutrients, that organisms are missing.
"They are actually better at it, because they have beautiful evening after this experience and good awakening and nothing is hurt."
"Only are confused from, where they are," he admitted pelikán spoil, on the pretext that sometimes patients a mood of at least the costs, which their treatment required.
Transfer ambulance and was hospitalized in acute bed, works and to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I sometimes it was as educational resource, so, then the children when I directly on rounds said, how much their drunkenness stood throughout the summer and that could also choke on Brigade, to earn on the one party," he added pelikán.
Health insurance companies, however, according to him, to regresním, in which management would be after parents vymáhaly the cost of treatment, in the cases of children drinkers are not.
The two l-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
The two l-159 out of a total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense traded transport plane Casa c-295m, on Tuesday it was flung into the Spanish sevilly, where is the aircraft manufacturer EADS - casa.
This is the first time that the machines of this type of appeared in the ownership of someone other than the Czech army.
In the foreign country has only been in exercises or s.r.o. years.
It is a dvoumístné version of l-159t1, which has operated the Czech army and which were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are single l-159.
You so far is zakonzervované in the aeru Vodochody and broker trade - company omnipol - pick up is already last week.
When physically vypraví aeroplanes from vodochod, according to John pejška of the press Department of Defense so far is not known.
"single aircraft l-159 for shift, have been allocated from the long imposed aircraft, and that without the other deposits and investments from the resort of the Ministry."
"dvoumístné l-159t1 were exchanged in the current situation and the form," said pejšek law.
He added that the army without dvoumístných aircraft will be left, because the Ministry in May 2009 has signed with aerem Vodochody Treaty at a value of 200 million crowns on four unnecessary machines l-159 conversion to the two dvoumístné machines.
One new plane took the army in July, the second will take over until the end of this year.
According to the pejška EADS pledged that aircraft enforce armaments to some of the NATO countries.
"The contract is clearly stated that the customer aircraft l-159 is company EADS and will be used to train pilots from the countries of NATO."
"It is therefore things customer, how this thing will be implemented," said pejšek.
Some time ago indicated that, for example, the Spanish army economic newspaper about l-159 not interested.
Exchange of five l-159 for one of the Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns approved last year, the Government mirka topolánka.
Ministry of Defense nevypsalo on the purchase of a tender and addressing directly of EADS.
The leadership of the defense argued that the shift will support future l-159 exports to abroad.
The Czech army got from aera 72 machines and used only 24, would like to sell the rest.
Purchase of aircraft casa is likely to have representatives and the sequel.
The European Commission, the Czech Defense Ministry has sued in the European court, therefore, that should selected on the basis of the European aircraft the tender, and not oslovením one producer.
Army already has taken the three aircraft Casa, the last should at Prague Airport kbely come during the 14 days.
Longer than his finger ring finger means lower cancer risk
Men, who have the index finger longer than your ring finger, are exposed to decreased the risk that become ill prostate cancer.
It is surprising conclusion Cancer Study, which on Wednesday published a British magazine.
It may be related to the surface of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a simple test risk of prostate cancer, particularly for a man to 60 years," she said spoluautorka studies Ros eelesová, Professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Finger so could help determine who men should Take test for prostate cancer, in particular in combination with a genetic risk factors or other threats, such as family health burden, she added eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with colleagues in Britain, more than 1,500 patients over three thousands of healthy men with prostate cancer, and in parallel.
More than half of the participants in the study had his finger on his right hand shorter than the ring finger.
It paid for them the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of those who had his finger longer than your ring finger, but this risk decreased to about 33 percent, for a man to age sixty, decline even 87 percent.
The ratio of these two fingers - shaped by in prenatal - probably reflects the different levels of child sex hormones, which are on display in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer forefinger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone supports the growing prostate cancer.
The Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Wenceslas pačes for čtk said that knows about this study subjects, but he said that should the relationship between the length of fingerprints and cancer was "completely proven."

Ice cream University
On "gelato university" on the boloně preparing zmrzlinoví the shepherd did to better annual period.
The basic course for future zmrzlináře, which lasts three days, there is a great interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Where, in fact, the ice cream takes?
From gelatiere and from gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a little zastarale zmrzlinář, produces cream in accordance with all rules of the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio out stěrkou ice cream from her not to coolant boxing, sister to waffles and sold.
To this, you don't have to go anzola dell 'Emilia found in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about the ice cream, at the "gelato-university" Italian firms carpigiani it.
Set up in 2003, some producer ice cream machines were an ice cream university, that ice cream from his machines with high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for future gelatieri, which lasts three days, it's a huge interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Offers, but also a few days' special courses of chocolate ice cream and practice in their own zmrzlinárně.
To someone in their midlife-crisis for a new career, others weigh on thin ice their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all continents - from Brazil via Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, the art teacher from California, loves the movement of slow-food and I would offer quality European industrial ice-cream product in the country in the future.
Anke from Berlin's business A and consultant want after years spent stressful work would start something of their own.
Two young egypťanky dream of that, in the kairu open zmrzlinárnu.
One man from Malta and one of the Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bar - and Canadian woman Julia arrived in the home, because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain the participants ideal properties perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silk softness and a good consistency.
Luciano forget during his training to jižanskou and patriotic prize on the cake: "the Italian gelato is simply the best - and then this is still notná dose of romance."
The first step of the production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients, whipped cream, milk powder milk, sugar and warm stabilizers into a mixer, which all electronic programme to 85 degrees and subsequently just cool to four degrees.
Then turn on the tap, and comes pasterizovaný white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice creams.
Immediately is Associate Professor covered with issues: it is possible produce only from natural substances without the stabilizer of ice cream?
How can a man himself to experiment?
Luciano warns, be carried away the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who speaks about Ice cream "only of the natural ingredients," apparently as used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, as is guarová flour from guarových grains.
Naturally, it is possible to make ice cream and without stabilizers, but must sell during one day, otherwise the chops and customer her same ice grain.
Some variation of the basic matter is a holiday.
Suspense that will be with aromatic essences.
Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream under additives to buy in the supermarket either in the department with fruit or in the department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"suppliers will try to impose a lot of you aromatized ingredients."
"You should but simply to experiment."
Either with fruit sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Ice cream or from white basic matter that changes the eggs to yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for some chocolate temptation.
Now may the rate of participants in an ice cream machine.
Luciano is always leave produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lískooříškové ice cream - either with or without their eggs in the basic mass, with more or less with aromatem or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit of mashed potatoes - due to taste that is not always better.
Lískooříšková flavor ice cream may not like it more butter pecan, when contains more the peanuts.
Favorite ice cream from the Kiwi produced group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when balanced combination of vyzdvihne taste of gelato, says Luciano correctly.
Ice cream production is purely computational task: if use of peach of mashed potatoes with a lot of sugar, must reduce the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
With lemon ice cream is the need for extra slice of sugar.
Luciano out machine, which specifies the sugar content in Fruit By winegrowers the measure must of grapes.
Table, fortunately, facilitate the numbers.
Production of ice cream already does not require so much physical effort as before.
Does not help the only instrument for the automatic production of basic matter.
There is also the machine, which a ready were an ice cream mixture at the same time umíchá to cream and cool to minus temperature.
Despite all the small accidents automation is inevitable.
Gustavo had brazilan dirty themselves and also their colleagues from top to bottom fruit of mashed potatoes, when he gets out of control a huge mixer.
"At any rate," considers the Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this would happen."
Auditors in two light
The European Food Authority EFSA is linked with the industry, which is experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation testbiotech now a group of experts, which is considered to be an independent institute for the estimate of biotechnology.
"It sounds like spiklenecká theory, but that we are well zdokumentovali," said on Wednesday in Munich head of testbiotechu Christoph then.
EFSA leading group of experts for gentechnicky modified plants, Harry kuiper, and another contract with union lobbies ilsi expert EFSA have for several years.
That is financed by concerns as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper EFSA was involved in a decisive manner to control rules for genetic plants and is, like, in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes then.
EFSA rules they agree on all the paragraphs of the documents ilsi and bear a manuscript industry, which should be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is for the second time, what testbiotech highlights the conflict of interest.
Recently went high manager of EFSA without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrárnímu concern syngenta - and the changed parties.
Also radio for central Germany, mdr revealed recently personnel link eu-úřadu for control of industrial lobby, which raised the interest of the Ministry for the Environment, as well as members of the EU.
EFSA, meanwhile, cannot identify a conflict of interest.
So is working with all serious information, also those of industry, if they are highly trained quality, it is mentioned in a statement.
From the experts who work for the EFSA, are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But must is evidence of them.
Kuiper admits its work for the International Life Sciences Institute, ilsi in the US.
Itself is referred to as a neutral forum of science, industry experts and policy - among other things for Risk Assessment of biotechnology without a contract lobbyists.
Independent Experts criticize as then, that are currently in a holiday gentechnicky modified plants for feeding animals without any attempt, and that the netestuje genetic plants response to environmental factors.
"We want to know what, for example, would do gentechnicky modified maize in the field," says then.
The current practice is only test isolated protein and not the whole of genetic plant, which nedoloží reliable results.
"If they're looking for risk, how then it would be possible to find them?" asked the fingers then.
She hilbeck agree.
Scientific worker examines the gentechniku since 1994, and is currently working on technical high school in Zurich.
In this area is attempting to industry as well as in the US, now also in Europe still more influence or discredit the critical scientists.
Therefore there almost no longer scientists, who wouldn't be linked with concerns.
Most of the nepublikují studies, which are critical for the companies.
"Industry controls the security Research," hilbeck view.
Trail stones
Uli gsell, also some acquired, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, tube on his back.
The demonstrations.
Snow.
Story is known: in September have arrived bagry and began pulling down a large piece of northern wings.
The world in Stuttgart has been the same: Thousands demonstrated against the s21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
When most of the wings a halt to construction, lay in ruins.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Limestone from crailsheimu, soft gross stone, which were used in years of 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years.
Has secured a few of these pieces.
"The stones are relics."
"must not disappear."
Dissolving the: "cheap and poor stone, simple and ambitions."
When one cut, smelled after the cigarette smoke.
Doesn't know what he would do with those pieces, yet.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell also.
Track stones from Stuttgart leads into the woods on the tübingen on the former deponii bombs of the French army, where Manuel rongen built its stone empire.
44-letý man trades with old stones.
Bought all that arose during the cutting in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if rozemlely on gravel or disappeared in the deponii," says in his office, wooden box, which was previously guard house.
Story, that he called names and threatening him when bought in September in all the papers said that the remains of northern wing from the company, which carries out the demolition.
But he spoke with opponents s-21 for days.
And explained that the demolition, of course cannot at all.
And when they are going on, then it is only reasonable, when the stones further use.
Then took about 200 s-21-protivníků approximately 80 kilograms heavy block, the price for every one piece of 6.50 to 14 euro.
As a reminder, some also in the hope that it will return in the construction.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, cargo 25 Large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest have long ago sold.
Keen gardeners, krajinní gardeners, home builders.
Come from all corners and dragged, what came in the trunk and on the trailer.
Stones of the dispute of Stuttgart had a "walls" or as the border, with herbs.
"The stone is actually nothing special," says rongen.
"If it wasn't the political inserts."
Getting in his field cars and going on the ride after his 20 hektarovém Kingdom.
First rights, the study said, later studied biology, then was on the computer, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And lover of stones.
Has saved 40000 tons of stones.
Collecting their treasures from the whole of Germany.
He says, that is the largest trader with old stones in the Republic.
Brakes.
In the snow is artistically worked sandstone.
"Once belonged to" marien-most in Dresden, says.
Sandstone from the river, yellow, warm, is happy.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on on the way up through the forest.
Shows on a pile of: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And more.
"Nice travertine."
Neckarstadionu once belonged to the blocks on Forum in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, cannstatt-travertin from police prezidia in Stuttgart, red granit from the temple St. blasien, tuf from hospital in heilbronnu.
What work, what the effort, what the sweat.
When rongen think of it as the first manually rozbíjely stones and převážely using simple kladkostrojů and bull vehicles, it will be quite funny.
Were crushed by "It would be a scandal, if something like this."
Not as the rich, very rich, not at all.
Businessman with stones today but employs 14 people and, in addition, up in the woods settled down kameníci, a sculptor, one Smith, one sklář and one a gardener.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfying," says makes the one who most of the remains.
In the foreseeable future, must in Cologne.
Also there will save stones.
Fight talent on the high-potenciály
For refreshments is a lot of people.
The 16 students jostle for sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and Sweets.
Technical University in braunschweigu and car maker Volkswagen invited students engineering and design of the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, to speak here about the car of the future - and by the way to meet the Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to in the race on the smartest person heads, as well as company VW, to succeed and betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible recruit in posluchárnách most talented graduates, even before they get to the labour market and others will to take an interest in them.
As the University of print no lists of success of their students, trying to discover exceptional talent in projects oriented companies to practice and get them.
, trying to motor concern to talent on the braunschweig the next day.
One young lady of personnel department's pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with VW logo.
Tells hopeful young talents of programmes in practice, student jobs and suggests they travel in concern.
Nico selle from the braunschweig old a Project together with VW.
See benefits for both parties: "The students are in contact with the industry and retrieve the experience."
"VW May at the same time to meet the students closer to meet interesting candidates and think about you, who could use as a partner."
Such cooperation, according to the selle, are not unusual.
News but is that so openly fighting for the students.
"Otherwise, he was more significant professional project," says selle.
Struggle for fresh graduates WILL BE ABOUT even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their staff of the long the multitude of applicants.
On the contrary, must try and try to lure particularly highly skilled labor force.
Particularly graduates engineering disciplines, have excellent negotiating position.
According to data of the Association of German engineers vdi remained in October compared 40,000 civil engineering positions.
And according to the forecast of vdi the lack of engineers will only increase.
The audit and consulting firm KPMG's Roman dykta on the hunting of talent.
Organizes demanding recruiting-events, such as. kpmg-race kind of modern race for treasure, in which participants must find a way to coordinate thing GPS.
Company plans to send such eight promising students after the US next year.
Participants can also see the branches of KPMG and to get acquainted with the company.
In advance will decide in two selection wheels, who will take part.
Only crème de la crème of many candidates will proceed to the US.
In the competition on the high potentials universities will pay according to the dykty still tougher laws.
"We want to distinguish themselves with our race from the other."
"simple trip on a sailor was too little for us."
It seems that the talent dykta Hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in contact with all the participants in the similar actions in the past year."
"Some will soon end studies and plans are for us apply for a job," he says.
In addition to the direct solicitation on campus, especially small and medium companies present classic on labor markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates to specialized exhibitions."
"such as to the intersolar," says sitha stübe, Head of Human Resources solar technology solarworld. Producer
Company from Bonn, employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issues with the young workers.
In the present time is listed 35 positions on the website of the company.
"In the present time it is difficult to fill the empty seats."
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact over the professors in universities.
Solarworld cooperates with the different high schools, such as university in freibergu.
"professors are reporting that it is possible for us to do my thesis practice or write."
Solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising.
Instead, trying to name to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"The great concerns that often cannot offer," says the personnel department stübe.
Play money the main role in search of work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, custody of children or other crucial factors are good options procedure.
Solarworld it occupied in one study of a great place work 55th place among the 100 Best Employers in Germany.
Institute compiles annual list of the best of German employers.
In addition, queries of others, as they are satisfied with their work, and the work environment and the framework conditions of the employees.
Head of personal stübe hopes that her location will bring points for candidates of work.
"I believe that the candidates to inform potential employers," especially on the external assessments, says.
Wolf reiner kriegler From a German employer branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long term strategy of good reputation as an employer.

And according to the krieglera this means primarily internal measures.
"The best way to make known as attractive employer is through its own employees," says.
Technically it is called the internal employer branding, thus requiring employers to market in the framework of its own employees.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
When the company well cares about its people and they identify with the company, then they will be from themselves do advertising his employer between friends and familiar.
"It is like a game with string," says kriegler.
Obama stopped new oil wells
Over the next few years are created before the coast of us-spolkového Florida State new oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
Government in Washington issued the ban - and the canceled definitively earlier plans.
Also from the Atlantic coast of New drilling banned are so far.
Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
Reason of strict ban, which would have to pay at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling rig," deepwater horizon "in April.
Before this accident, which cost eleven workers life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US President Barack Obama under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf.
Supporters of the US is trying to reduce the dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date is not clearly explained, who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The criticism is a British energy group BP, which is faced miliardovými applications.
The Commission of Inquiry, which instructed the Obama, should present the results during December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar drilling ban, which paid from the explosion.
Subsequently submitted various oil concerns the request to new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disaster stricter controls and striktními security regulations.
In the current time, essentially reforming the Control Office, which attracted attention many korupčními accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that cancels a lucrative options for tax evasion for oil and gas groups.
Industry now openly, warns that tougher regulation fundamentally be reduced the volume of oil produced in the Gulf.
"The Government's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of gas and oil industry," is the result of the survey in the consulting firm bdo - Before drilling ban on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance, have still to complain to uncertainty in this field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation changes."
Investment in new mining projects the put - at the expense of growth until further notice.
The ogoni burned
The water in the rivers is olejově brown, it smells like a gas station: billion gallons of oil destroyed nature in the field of ogoni in Nigeria.
People alive stealing, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine akpobari it means well.
"DO NOT," environmental activist, helps to journalists: "Today, you'll receive a lens still have enough oil mud."
37-letý nigeriánec followed an attempt of the boy, who was up to the chest water, flanked by streaks: the scene are active in the fire with a nearly up nicely colors.
That beneath the surface float Brown of the oil, is not to see.
Previously there was enough garnel in containers, Esther badom on the bank of the river bodo-jetty says.
Meanwhile, has been slowly flowing water completely dead.
Five years ago, spilled into the huge liquid area from the broken leadership of the large quantities of oil.
Fishermen from a nearby town Bodo must paddle at least six hours to get to the waters, where the fish are: ogoni area, which is located in the heart of the Niger Delta belongs to one of the most contaminated areas in the world.
WAY DOWN THE River mangrovníkovými the swamp with a side tributaries is only noticeable the entirety of the trigger.
Engine for the boat's cooking water instead of light brown porridge and who plunge out his hand in the water, oil fingers.
Roots mangrovníků bars from countries such as black rods liquorice, rarely occurring palm leave their leaves sadly hanging.
Vainly seeking of birds, which is normally in the humid areas are: die as soon as the engine on the boat, rozhostí earlier in paradise, where it smells like a gas station, scary silence.
"This, what is going on here, is an environmental management of the war," says sadly celestine akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
Compared with the war is legitimate.
The settlement ogoni is a battlefield, where it is already several decades of fighting: more than 60 years ago I filed the first invaders from Europe, here in the 1980's shape the first resistance of the later popraveným writer Ken saro-wiwa concern shell had to stop here in 1993, its production, because it was too dangerous for employees.
Today, in the area of ogoni may company back: while The Daily, benefit from across the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of leadership of the black gold are more than two million barrels of oil fields in the field of ogoni fallow for concern is the situation very unstable.
Every few hundred metres the bars of the water of the steel structure as bizarre statue: "Christmas Trees," so are too gently referred to head of the drilling holes.
Are 50 years old, most up to his rusty.
Breaks every once in a while, Such a title vrtného opening, tells akpobari, and then comes the constant stream of oil into the water.
According to the estimates of experts cost in the ecosystem in the Delta more than two billion litres for 50 years: each year, the amount of oil, which cost to the sea for aljašky supertankeru "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the crash - one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is responsible for the remains of environmental disaster.
While the group shell indicates the sabotage and organized the theft of crude oil at more than 90 percent of pollution, trekking environmental talks about crackling titles wells and netěsných lines as the main reason.
Shell in Nigeria requires much smaller than it is customary in the world, has accused security regulations concern in the year 2008 us-americký scientist Richard Steiner: only the quantity of disorders on lines is said "several times higher than elsewhere."
On the ground, which looks like a deserted from a distance, the oil zašpiněná workshop in the open air, emerging from mangrovníků figures: are completely naked and up to its neck from oil.
Under one of the many drums, which are partly the United leadership, partly possibly spread all over the country, burning fire: illegal small refiners.
Oil in a barrel over the fire is a few hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First comes from the leadership in záchytného pot of gas, later dripping at the end of the leadership of kerosene and diesel in the end.
In this way, produces Michael and his four associates of up to four barrels a day after 300 litres: "We make it so 34.000 naira" - about $22.
People use chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil delta state of black Africa.
Nigeria holds only one refinery.
Ridiculously low price of 40 cents euro per litre of diesel illegal producers can even Trump: because they have the raw materials for free.
Comes from everywhere," bunkerů," who link to the leadership in the area of ogoni: according to experts, and in the entire area of the Niger Delta is the country at least 16 million litres of crude oil a day.
But only negligible a small part of the temporarily stored fill the raw materials are illegally zušlechtí: the biggest share of organised criminal networks, to which they belong to, and politicians and senior officials of the army, tankers and sell it on the world market.
Debate, whether caused disaster residents and their interference or lax way of production, considers the activist, akpobari for purely academic.
"If nepovažovaly oil companies for the intruder, and if so perfectly did not destroy the essence of fishermen, then would not be or sabotage, or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime it is above all, but the relationship ogoni to shell dilapidated, that looks into account only the departure of concern: "Maybe they show up other nations as the Chinese as better."
Michael zneklidní.
"high time to have disappeared," says muscular producer.
"Soldiers can come at any moment."
If it is found the special military unit, and while there is no prison, but painful bribe them.
Also soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country, like all nigeriánci - want to benefit from the raw materials.
"That got cursed thing our country in all respects to the bottom," says akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in engines a380
A380 obviously has a major security concern.
Investigators found in search of machines that make an emergency landing, the possible construction engine mistake, which could lead to a "catastrophic failure."
Airline Qantas wants to sue engine maker.
Passengers of Airbus company Qantas in emergency landing at the beginning of November probably should have more luck than it was not yet known: Australian Office for air security has encountered a major security concern in the their investigations on the engines of some machines a380 - and now is warning of a possible construction error.
Maybe failure would have heavy consequences: on the one olejovém connection could arise leaks because of damage, said this Thursday in published a statement atsb office.

Almost two weeks ago in Pike misses River near the city greymouth to a strong explosion occurred.
Down 29 miners in age from 17 to 62 years was in zavaleno.

It comes with horror to artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas winding refn is trying to overcome the old borders with its combat an epic of "walhalla rising again."
On what probably thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding audience refn when run "walhalla rising"?
Captured vikingský fighter with one eye, mads mikkelsen, free from their torturers and at a large kills almost with supernatural force their opponents - it is ideal for Young Men's viewers who are seeking bloody action, because our hero helps the cruel killing methods and their enemies tearing even the insides of the stomach alive, as it has in a bad mood.
On the other hand, jednooký, as it is in fact called, during the entire film he won't say a word and even the other characters pronesou one or at most two sentences or will be swayed by the strastiplným's dying.
Otherwise, silent and carousing in an beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers background to the world Vikings about a thousand years ago.
Film is ideal for adult enthusiast rather movies with an interest in existencializmus and very calm images of cameras.
Is good, when the film's more target groups, it's just a shame, when the mutually exclusive.
Director winding refn, after he made a wild and stylizovanou on drug dealerech Trilogy "pusher," is considered a Danish version of the Director Quentin tarantina stoically but has resisted, to their works closer to either more humor on a mainstream or less brutality artistic audience.
Most of the art movies is likely to leave to discourage everywhere stříkajícím brain and parts.
Supporters action films, unudí no later than in the moment, when jednooký issues of free vysvětlitelných reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem, and will remain hanging an eternity in calm and fog, than probably there will carry team to America and continues to keep silent.
In Germany, is not what wonder, then, that the "walhalla rising" Got in cinemas and now was only released on DVD.
It's a pity, mainly because of a záběrům, but also because the for individual facade, points to got a blood, hides exciting cinema, which brought a little attention.
In this film is not about dialogue or a crook, everything is atmosphere, some dream, which became the film.
And from the viewer is not to run.
Refn nedopřeje or a moment to release him and slowly strangling their chill images of him and the Grim hypnotickým surge through a video, first of all, but I hate, which from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy, which helps jednookému, will keep something like innocence, all the others are driven fury.
Most of all jednooký hero, whose motives are never explained, that is going to happen in time for the enemy and transitional ally warrior from Hell, maybe Envoy of the devil.
Exemplifies destruction, perhaps, but also only for those depraved.
"walhalla rising" is a movie that is possible hate and admire for angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious natural work
Office for IAEA nuclear energy has a new warning on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
Countries but has resisted express - and even will not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 they attack the at least four Israeli combat aircraft f-15 and mysterious square building in Syria.
Stands on the euphratu; the more city is remote 30 kilometres and appoint Dair as-saur.
In the documents of the International Office for IAEA Nuclear Energy Agency - is its name when it comes to the reactor, which allegedly put Syria with the help of North Korea in this square schovaném in the valley, which turn from mainstream.
The CIA on the basis of communication us-americké foreign secret services from the end of April 2008 would be the reactor, also known by the name of the village el-kibar work well, on the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s, not for anything else.
The CIA presented the video with nezaostřenými satellite imagery.
Using computer animation made it clear where that reactor before the destruction of components could be is the act of diminishing in his copy of the North Korean nuclear center yongbyon model.
Moreover, were still the photos that showed the building close or even from within.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before running, but even without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, is not much more than that, even Riddles were increased at a time.
Earlier us-prezident George W. Bush recently in his memoirs published, that the CIA was before the attack a lot of certain, that Syria is building in el-kibar reactor, but in fact had no evidence that the country is "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some reporters of the secret services in Europe are still cautious and speak only about "Alleged reactor," even if the presentation of the CIA are considered to be "hodnověrnou."
They lack a clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
On the issue of how is sure, that has a reactor, said in the summer of high diplomat, UN, the IAEA said "has enough material to put questions."
While rubble allegedly "unused military buildings" was syřany quickly odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Yet managed to find in June 2008, The IAEA team under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people.
In addition, received IAEA via satellite photographs of commercial vendors Member State of the time just after the attack, which should be better than the ones that presented the CIA.
Unfortunately, are not on the market, the film because it is exclusively bought unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
IAEA so it cannot confirm their identity.
Syria has always claimed that she was never a secret nuclear program, and not even put the reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, said the Damascus.
But it showed the IAEA after analysis of particulate matter.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss things - as well as satellite shot.
In addition, banned revizorům second inspection in el-kibar and access to the wreckage rozbombardované buildings.
But also Israel stubbornly silent.
"We never comment on," said recently that the official position in the time the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Investigation of this case, it runs from June 2008 and unsuccessfully "is growing into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the Authority," as a Western diplomat admitted at IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty for the Prohibition of nuclear weapons, on which the IAEA oversees.
IAEA considered key to moving on the other three facilities, which are to be "in a functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and still exist on the difference from him.
Auditors while missing so far, or to the device is, or what function or why they are suspected.
According to the information newspaper süddeutsche zeitung is IAEA internally indicates as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah derived again according to nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, isis identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite films, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
Apparently is inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, rejects Syria IAEA access to these three points.
In Vienna said, that the IAEA's haul of a fishing expedition - that would be sent to the US in advance, to spot the military base.
Nuclear detectives were notified to the US Secret Service.
IAEA has material and also the satellite imagery that among the three places and the square for euphratu beamed material here and there.
In Vienna, a Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with the production of fuel."
But "there is no evidence of senzibilních activities," that is the enrichment of uranium and the new processing; processes, which are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
While type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
Where but the uranium came from and where he later should secede plutonium for a bomb, on the central issues, there are only likely to estimates.
Also it is not known whether the debris, which could contain important clues are stashed in the three places.
Like disappeared from the surface of the Earth's cost hundreds of trucks, no one does not seem to have information, where the debris got.
Only a few miles from the el-kibar remote and on the other hand, euphratu salt mine al-tibni, who left Syria to check in 1998 as a warehouse for radioactive waste, IAEA considers it unlikely.
An earlier IAEA inspector Robert kelley gave him in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for a renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images of the universe but show that, after the IAEA has requested access by Syria on all suspected places natural work and the large containers.
Could be a coincidence, but that didn't work to clear up suspicions.
In addition, speaks diplomatic circles about the fact that the IAEA spent many months building for revizory plan that would have allowed Syria hold a possible military secrets - only that effort shows how big is the interest revizorů.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected the proposal.
If even told a year ago to calm down the Western diplomats in Vienna, that is after the reactor destroyed, and therefore the thing burns speaks for several months, US Ambassador glyn Davies of the special inspections, which is one of the harsher funds, which has a Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls.
Chief of the IAEA yukiya amano, which would have to inspection while propose, already talked about "options, to which the kloním" so far but is hesitant in the future.
This choice offers a great risk: on one side is the need for a majority in the Board of the IAEA and many of the present 35 countries has definitely interested in an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What is going to happen when finally find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
Since then, what Angelina had Jolie began in the summer to work at still anonymous overhead prvotině, there was a problem.
Wrote the scenario, it is a love Story Women itself from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Doesn't know about many more are not yet - but it causes unrest.
Steadily, the talk of that, which is a Muslim, falls in love with the woman during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian Women's groups immediately protestovaly, so the hastily shifted planned shooting of Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile the film in Hungary dotočil and is in postproduction Center, in bosensku but still objects.
Bakira hasecic from the women's war victims over un-organizace wrote to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with actress, now the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also informed the Ambassador un-organizace to help refugees.
Is not just diplomatic - offered women already weeks ago meeting in Hungary, which but rejected.
Meeting must be held in Bosnia, said hasecic.
In kempech, where the znásilňovalo, love stories took place and the position of Jolie to victims reveals enough on the script.
So her organization recommended un-organizaci to help refugees, to release Jolie as Ambassador, inform the guardian.
What exactly scenes wrote Jolie?
Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read her script, relaxed after the smaller tahanicích - Shooting in Sarajevo is not entirely clear why then Jolie still did not arrive.
Young Author stresses that no political intentions, in his film followed that with a great deal of effort into conflict in Yugoslavia, he wants to show that the terrible consequences of war and all concerned parties to space.
Due to the content remains vague.
There are even one version of the film on the Internet, which is really quite different: lovers were already before the start of the war, and they meet again, when she is as Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená to Serbian camp, where he serves as The Guardian.
Which really is a lot different than "victim of rape, falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that film Jolie really starts before the war - it's true.
Jolie, argues that there is pressure on it, which "is not fair and is based on false information."
Now she can go free is already hekeři of Hollywood: by publishing illegally on the Internet its scenario, how many times have already done it.
Nothing but away
This evening, it is good for the Irish once again.
No sign of grief.
Domestic team dominated power significantly over their guests from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans screaming joy for the sound of a loud music, the feet.
Bailey-pub in jihoirském Cork has been heating up, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three - and trefují meters into beer cups.
"The beer pong" is called the bizarre theater, and it is possible to win 500 euro as a premium and the tickets to Las Vegas for the World Cup in beer pongu in January.
Cian tanner is quiet type; this ukřičená beer game and restrained informatik, it too neladí together.
Yet to talk to 26-letý man, away from the vexing question, what the future will bring.
His plan is not playing the Passion in Las Vegas, rides in January, in an interview in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling from this," he says.
"It is so far, and I don't have a job there yet."
Yet his friend already waiting for him in the aucklandu: - "immediately received his dream job as eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home tried on his luck abroad for two of the three siblings tannerů.
His sister Yvonne, social worker, is in Sydney, his brother, Colin is now a place as it-poradce in London.
Boys go: as well as for tannerů it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish leaves in the foreseeable future, the country, experts predict the Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs esri in Dublin.
Charge even by the year 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million people that is a major loss.
If the predictions confirms, there will be a similar expatriate wave, what protrpělo Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of the rise, which brought about the Irish people great wealth, now extends neutěšenost again.
Economic crisis znejišťuje mainly young, educated the Irish, who have experienced only rise.
Loss of employment and social descent seemed to be in these years of boom absurd.
Need for everyone was, money was tight.
Meanwhile, but are three of the ten women and men in 30 years without a job.
There are many letters in the Irish Times readers who complain: "in Ireland is everything from the hill."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - who can, but that it is gone, and our country by losing a generation."
"The last please let off."
Student rights leanne caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future of black, because the government said only can deceive and young people offers no prospects for the future.
"compose the minimum wage, but have a strategy, how to create new jobs," says 20-letá.
Watching, as her classmates motají from one his practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that it will have to move itself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen mclarnon trying to see this issue positively.
Mclarnon organizes "workingabroadexpo" exhibition, which offers the service on the subject of work abroad.
"For starters on the labour market is work abroad, an excellent chance, how to take the first steps on the career," says the manager.
There are photos on his Internet site surfers in Australia and skiers to snowboard in Canada.
Message is clear: to work abroad are not visa versa, but the freedom and joy.
Knows about what it is to build something somewhere else, for half a year seán on 'donovan.
Because 29-letý engineer in Ireland had no work, is now busy together with 15 Irish colleagues at the building in Germany.
Just building in gelsenkirchen fashion house.
In January continues to Hannover or to Berlin on another project.
About 'donovan meanwhile, gets rarely home, because she works in extra innings, in order to be able to pay their home loan at the house.
"The situation is really a little crazy," says sometimes, when for the first time in a long time crossing the threshold of their own house.
"I make money in Germany at the house in Ireland, in which in fact, I'm not at all."
Laughs embarrassed and gives vychladlými rooms.
A small house is in good, with a column garden, in vjezdech they park big expensive cars.
On the 'donovan bought a house together with sister four years ago for 380.000 euro - 100-procentně financed by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, easy money were without many of the issues," he says.
Is fear that it might not have been well loan?
He thinks of 'donovan moment, doleje hot tea and says: "I don't have children, I had to feed and I'm young; and that if everything wrong, I can start again."
Construction engineer doesn't like the complaining, which now so often hears.
"No one need not starve - our situation is not even a little bit so dramatic as before on this island," says.
"A little work to do IN ABROAD, it is not the worst of it, what can happen - maybe then we will just feel like the Irish people."
Laughing, and then tells of her father, who left for the last economic crisis to England.
"After seven years was back again and life passed in Ireland on, quite simply."
Cian tanner is like this idea.
Keep open the future and simply wait, how will develop life elsewhere.
In a row has also several years of work in London, and why it should not be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend also good?
But there is one more thing that him enough concerned about these days: the party his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
Fear, that could go wrong on farewell party.
"mainly no emotion," says and drink a beer.
"Goodbye, it is alarmingly."
"Call it the party left, quite simply, with few friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as the promotion of private business.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
Many regions as more influential than the United States and Brazil.
These are some of the results of the survey latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and went exclusively in the magazine The Economist.
Since the survey held regularly since 1995, so can track changes in their attitudes across the whole area.
In this year's survey, which was held in September and at the beginning of October, is dominated by two related things.
The first of them is that Latin America is quite a happy mood.
The second is to enhance stability attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in several countries on the fringe of the Pacific has risen significantly in South America, see Table 1.
In Peru, where, for example, is from a 2002 economic growth in average of 6 percent per year, increased support for Democracy of minimum 40% in the year 2005 to 61% in the current year.
Rose also in Mexico, where the economics convalescent after deep decline in production in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas are believed Democrats, which brings the regional average, see chart 2.
About 44% of the respondents across the areas cited satisfaction with how democracy works in their country in practice, this is about the same number as in the last year, but in comparison with the year of 2001, when it was about 25%, this is a big increase in the chart 3."
Some 34% said that they trust the Assembly, in their own country and 45% of the trusted by the government, once again, this is about the same number as in the past year, but this is a big difference in comparison with the year 2003, 17% and 24%.
Ten years ago undermined democracy in Latin America, the economic crisis.
Support was established during the world financial crisis, probably for that reason, that many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed strong recovery.
In addition, stronger network of social security help to protect the poor people.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, announced this week that the ratio of Hispanic living in poverty has increased in the year 2009 only slightly, and again in this year fell to 32%.
But mood change in a wide range of from country to country, see chart 4.
Brazil's strong economic performance and its popularity of outgoing President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widely acclaimed sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was serious and aggravated the situation of violent crime.
For only the second time since they came to carry out surveys, sees more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem crime rather than unemployment, see chart 5,.
Roughly 31% says that either they or their close relatives have become the victims of crime in the last year, but this is a decrease in comparison with by 38% of last year, and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private business and market economy: around 71% of the respondents across the area says that private business, it is necessary for development, this percentage has increased from 56% of the year 2007, see chart 6.
About 58% agree with that, that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage has increased from 47% of the last year.
Interesting is that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion, and 80% supports private business there, although their leftist president Hugo Chavez vyvlastňuje, many private companies.
Brazil is the country which has a leading position in the field, as have mentioned the 19% of the respondents, compared to 18 percent in last year, followed by the United States, 9%, unchanged from last year, and Venezuela, 9% compared to 11% in the last year.
However, the United States are considered to be the most influential country respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela has enjoyed success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one expected that general elections will be in Haiti on 28 November perfect.
But it was much worse than the outsiders, who are trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections gave the vote, the ballot papers rozmetané after performing the ballot box and repeated channels, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many haiťanů, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, potulovalo around and try to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them, it gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several of předběžců shouted, that this is a fraud and called for the removal of elections.
Protests, some of them violent nature, spread all over the country.
Yet Edmond mulet, a senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, said that "in many ways, it was a very good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, said that "they do not believe that these discrepancies, however they were serious, not necessarily lift the process."
In other words, the show continues.
Electoral authority, whose opposition voices are bound to Rene prévalovi, nepopulárnímu odstupujícímu president and his candidate Jude célestinovi, has to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel martelly rapper and mirlande manigat, the former First Lady, backed away from their original challenges the vote, to be declared invalid.
But the problem can occur if Mr. célestin, which has little or negligible support among voters, will be marked the Electoral Commission for it, that reached a decisive contest.
A cholera epidemic because of řádící and more than 1 million people who still live in tents after the earthquake, there was concern that voter turnout will be low.
In the end, many haiťanů to vote, but because of the dezorganizace was prevented them from doing so.
Around 250 thousand of the identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained shortly before the elections retained.
A lot is at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians determined themselves.
Come on to the center
In weeks, when she is suddenly widowed, benefits cristina from in Argentina's president, from public sympathy, when its popularity has grown to more than 50% from 20, the highest level since was chosen in 2007.
Yet reversing this success in a successful campaign for a second term in elections next year, may depend on whether being renounces the grieving the fernándezová rigorous her late husband, a predecessor and political partner néstora kirchnera.
And on these characters, everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, which continued in economic policy and, after his wife successfully became a president, was in the habit of budgeting, which downgrading of the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple to spend additional revenue as it pleases.
Government Madam fernándezové lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and has been further destabilised in death of Mr kirchnera for heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling political movement peronist added to the lady from in.
But after the chaotic meetings, to which some of the hitting and accusing the government of corruption, Congress failed to pass a budget for the year 2011.
"I am not going to argue," said the president.
The budget for the year 2010 will now pay also in the next year, the President will have more space to spend as you want.
An overheating economy: this year is likely growth to 9%.
Official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists to talk about the number, which is close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by a economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
Has burdened has refused to deal with the IMF, for the private sector and cleanse the indec statistical agency, which came on the monitoring official inflation statistics.
President fernándezová moderate this policy can now?
Has called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit the wage growth in the next year to 18%.
Economy was supported by the growth of world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation has growth based on the devaluation in the year 2002.
This may be the reason why the President gives fernándezová know that wants to restore the Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with the holders of bonds, who previously rejected the restructuring of the debt, which paid Argentina in 2001.
Now faces the President fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes roughly $6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted on that, that this fact not in sight of the IMF, as it is normal.
But last month amado hut, Minister of Economy announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to a new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which was designed to show an introduction to cleaning indec.
It is still unclear whether the president fernándezová he wants to stay in politics after the end of the term, when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to gain support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time the return of argentinců of summer holidays, which are in March, will be a wave of sympathy to decline.
If it wants to win the next election, will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to forgo quietly, many of the views that her husband in politics held.
Half encouragement for China
Taiwanští voters are closer to a closer links with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks of his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the legitimate, have voted on November 27, mayor and City Council in five urban constituencies, which can be considered a broader evaluation President Ma ying-jeou.
Mr. President Ma itself is a representative of the prevailing on the mainland and have strong putting in business relations, including a part of the Free Trade Agreement, in the biggest adjustment in relations with China since 1949.
The President Ma through the test, but only just.
Although his party kuomintang, KMT ended win three of the five offices mayor, failed to win a majority of the vote.
In addition to the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party, the DPP, which is disposed to greater independence of Taiwan, gained nearly 50% of the vote, against 45% of the KMT.
If this were a presidential elections, should President Ma trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of votes of his party decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP together with the KMT party was in city councils.
Elections took place as the majority of Taiwan election, which include the noisy electoral freight cars and mass assembly with flags with the poorly oděnými girls.
Part of even compulsory mysterious was an assassination attempt.
Sean lien, son of lien Chan, KMT honorary chairman of the KMT, was canvassing for candidates on the eve of the elections.
Man in the crowd shot young the viewer lien purely on the face, wounded and killed him.
Bizarrely, whether he had ozbrojenec was specified in the intention to hurt the liena or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, tsai ing-wen, head of the DPP, says that shooting the elections, voters direction suspicion falls on the DPP and leads to the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner in the campaign, China was.
It was remarkable how remained in the background of the issue of the land.
Instead, the candidates were tilting on the plans for state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan he usually uses its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
KMT has therefore tend to avoid the ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP was also dropped from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
And awareness, this is in response to the fact that China's trade is of fundamental importance to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. President Ma for his party, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing are to be expected, that will continue in the commercial bribes, together with its strategy to Taiwan lured back into the herd.
China lose time to send negotiators to taipeje, to set a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Certainly would also like to see the political integration, but in turn.
On it will be better to wait until after the presidential elections in the year 2012.
DPP party in any case appeared itself.
Two years ago, was on the wrong level: its former leader, Chen shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President in 2000-08 was a troublemaker and a proponent of clear independence.
But under the leadership of the tsai developed a new generation of DPP, which is moderate and is working hard on this, to attract the experts and young people.
The DPP tsai was provolávána as List to the President, such as Su tseng-changem, who held office under the chenem.
Their party now is doing everything possible to show that also can work together with Beijing.
The tsai publish plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without previous conditions.
The taiwanské tsai tells the public, that her party represents "a credible alternative" to a hurried Mr Ma access to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be a better place if insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
Even ordered the Su, pragmatikovi not to stand for president.
But even without the intervention of the DPP chena will fight for a choice between a potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search their own people.
Evaluation of Mr Ma was bad, and despite the rapid pace of economic growth; candidates KMT wouldn't go to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and widening the gap between the rich and poor.
KMT spokesman says that přeorganizuje his Cabinet, as well as local branches.
Heavily promoted by the proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly ties are limited.
At the same time as the majority of Taiwan people's economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio chianga, the top publicisty," point, from which there is no return, has passed."

Microbes with resistance to arsenic increases the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere
Discovery of strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the area to search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers discovered unusual bacteria here in the country and say that it is a sign that life has opportunities, which stands outside the main elements that were still considered to be the basic.
"This organization has double capacity."
"may either because of phosphorus or arsenic." Growth
"This is a very special, but it is not proof that it is a form of really 'an alien' life," on this fact Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, spoluautor report, which appeared in a Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
Long was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake in California, are able to continue in growth after the arsenic will replace phosphorus.
"Will you wonder what everything is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, spoluautor report.
This finding is important for searching for life outside the country, as researchers must be able to identify life and to know how life may look, Anbar said.
Study focuses on the microbes found in the country.
However, the report about this news published, to discussion, betrayed that details about her award, caused widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
Discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that set of elements, which we consider 'standard', may not be so absolutely necessary for life," said Charles cockell, Professor at the planetary and space science research institute, Milton Keynes, Open University, in Great Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element of the other element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," he added cockell.
This was not a random prize.
Felisa wolfe-simon of astrobiologického Institute in NASA, which the study led, has focused on the Mono Lake, since it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar to the elements, she thought so that the microbe is exposed to the elements, may be able to replace the one for the other.
"poisonous arsenic is mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar phosphorus."
"The result is that the organisms can very hard to these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different, that as well as phosphorus is not working. If they get to the organism, to begin work Anbar biochemical processes," he explained.
Scientists gather the bacteria known as gfaj-1 and display is increasing the concentration of arsenic bacteria, which are able to adapt and growth.
Microbes are better at of phosphorus, but also due to the fact that they can survive with a arzenem, increases the possibility that the form of life, which uses arsenic, it can occur naturally, and either elsewhere in the country or to another planet or a month, where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but never found an example, on which would prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in the old days in the country, she said, and so the scientists have speculated that it could use the previous forms of life.
"It suggests that there may be other ways to create life, not only in the way the created in the early period of the country," said Foster, who was not part of the research team wolfe-simona.
Research has been supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health

The introduction of subtle police control in China
As the urban military instructor, Tang shenbin went after square, strictly checking their orders and issuing orders, with military authority.
I, to the female member of - Chinese sturdy vymahatelky urban order, of a feared and opovrhované for their crackdowns and a fondness for the violence - provided some the impression on the small crowd been led.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering softly," as they look pretty girls! "
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as the ruler.
Four headgear perfectly sitting on her hair, which are completely linked blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think that they are, on average," said breezily Mr. Tang.
"models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the urban peacekeeper in China.
One city ordered to new you yard birds had higher education.
Guangdong's exports changed up šedo-zelené uniforms for allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China has replaced staring eyes for the strong Equipment: in the year 2009, was in one report stated that 50 officers obklíčilo firmly cart picnics and he was looking at the vendor, when the then after a half hour packed up and left.
Xindu, urban district, with 680 000 inhabitants in the main picture in chengdu choose operation.
Since the year 2003 District said his city police on 13 of women, which have been selected according to their appearance, specifically symmetry and young age.
The objective is to show in addition to the gross page Police also softer, a woman's hand.
Unfortunately the very scarlett Johansson should trouble, to get into the secret of the Chinese urban groups.
Argued Would critics for good reason.
In contrast to the police, is only allowed to promote urban Code, these police impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media normally recorded a different reality.
In January 2008 police inspectors from the province of Hubei utloukli outsider spectator to death after he used his cell phone to work, as they used in the crackdown on the protest against the site.
Last year saw police training in Beijing, the manual to this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual was description of how effectively beat perpetrators without evidence of blood, among others.
This year, then got a melons in Shanghai into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left side of the brain injury.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, displays Chinese policemen, as attacks on the street sellers.
"chengguan said the government," China Daily, the national issue, says in the last year after further discussion about the tactics.
THE PAPER SAID "very thoroughly cleaning up."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After that, take up what the county advertise in October an interest of eight new female officers, an editorial the Beijing Evening News to deal with the question of whether women have a real obligations or are only distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
District demanding women candidates in age from 18 to 22 years with a good character and "Five features of the faces in the right proportions."
Adeptky should have height is higher than the average - higher than 1.6 meters.
Výslužba at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials argue that the work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is one important thing," said an unnamed police officer on rednet.com, though a government Web site.
"candidate must first show external quality, which then determine further height, weight, features the face, etc, are among them."
Then comes to a number of nature and "internal quality."
Women are like flower vase, he said, he added," In addition to this, that will be vázami, will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, Deputy Director of the district of the city, power does not agree with this description.
But suggests that the requirements on height are common in China and also for other jobs for both sexes.
As well as a requirement on geometric name features of the face.
Which means that the issue of good appearance is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilation, certainly not apply.
"cannot accept to serve in the US lame Mr zheng or a man," he said.
"His image, would not be good."
Liu Yi, which holds a patrol on the square baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces like apples and gently shaped his mouth.
Does not believe that the emphasis on her appearance could have sexist character, she said.
"Do you think that in this uniform look sexy?" she asked with an ironic view.
Her collaborator with dimples, 21 Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
No opposition against his limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are greater than only against traders in the streets, where they can carry out their work.
Every morning is group against the more than ten trhovcům, who are running on foot or on wheels and trying to sell knedlíčků and dishes tofu as much as possible before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have said it many times you!" said Miss Xu, when he started trhovec run, and at the time left his round with a with noodles.
Police describe their obligations as more humdrum than hard.
"Every day it is in the nature of the same," she said huang Jing, 20, who is studying in its own time marketing.
"The routine."
One of the reasons is that the female a state trooper have powers as their male counterparts, so that they can to confiscate goods retailers.
Can only threatened to report their male leading the fact.
Then tendency is to protect them from flash public acts of hostility against official apparatus, which are common in the framework of the whole of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunmingu, capital of the province yunnan rebelled, after the spread false rumors about the fact that policemen killed a.
More than ten police officers or the police officers were injured in the hours of darkness; 14 government vehicles was reversed or zapáleno.

Prosecutors will not blame the senator ensigna
Senator John ensigna Justice Department prosecutors cleared of criminal charges, which covered his affair with the former adviser for the campaign and his efforts to ensure the lobby, announced on Wednesday the senator lawyers.
Decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. ensign, faced with nevadský Republican, and that was, until the scandal, considered as a possible Republican candidate for president, for the year 2012. his affair was in the national headlines and damaged his career.
Authority of the ensigna said that was the decision, which followed almost after annual investigation," certainly pleased."

The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there are serious evidence about the fact that Mr. ensign preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
Talks, email and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that the ensign helped douglasu hamptonovi, one of his assistants, ensure lucrative Lobby, which should lead to silence the hamptona and his wife, cynthie of senátorově relationship with her.
The ensigna hamptonová once worked as a cashier in the campaign.
Mr. ensign contacted a number of political supporters, to find work for the hamptona and supported their views, after the hamptona recruited to loboval for them, so the documents and interviews.
Since he was hampton recently, the assistant of Mr ensigna was been excluded from law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for the year.
Experts say on ethics, that unusual settlement of the ensigna and the hamptona, who were a aférou friends, appeared in the violation of the ban of lobbying.
The evidence, which were published," it became clear that it is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who is specialized in defence of clients, who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator ensigna, Mr. brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics, said that the Ministry is cautious with regard to the political actions, after the big number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend legal proceedings against former senator tedu stevensovi amid accusations of failure by the state prosecutor's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly it's just hid weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, advocacy group, which filed in the case several complaints against the ensignovi.
"In fact on it, shows that the high ranking government officials the laws don't apply," she added.
Paul coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr ensigna, said in an interview that he had on Monday called the State representative of the Ministry of Justice and, consequently, then the next day, and told him that the neshledalo no charges against his client.
Obhajovací Mr ensigna team is cooperating with prosecutors in an effort to convince them that Senator, as his office repeated in the Wednesday statement," acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. coggins refused to specify the legal arguments, which passed the state's representatives.
"It is not me to know details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice in addition to that, we think, that made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint, in which ethical Group gives charges that payment of parents ensigna hamptonům in $96,000 violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to show that the money meant nothing other than a gift.
One Company, for which the ensign helped the hamptonovi find lobbistickou work, company NV, the energy, the main nevadská company that was long Senator supported.
One email from the December 2008 proved that then, what Mr. hampton in society to act as a lobbyist, head of the workers began the ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr hamptonem and told him that "thumping" subject to the Ministry of Interior on disputed.
Mr. ensign also took part in the lunch with Mr hamptonem and other nevadským client, allegiant air and called on the Minister of Transport, to arranged a meeting on behalf of airlines, after hire the hamptona to lobbistickou work.
Last year, when for the first time a report on the affair, the ensign apologized to voters and resigned from his office, as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After mnohaměsíční stagnation of Mr. ensign two weeks ago, told reporters that plans to take part in the third term in the Senate.
In the report, that the ensign already is not the aim of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said that Senator hopes that the ethics committee will follow the Ministry of Justice and end the whole investigation quickly.
"Senator ensign is looking forward to continuing in their hard work in the name of nevadského the people," said further.
Call municipalities Cheshire is turning to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom half a dozen wrote.
Minute by minute issue report on a horrible testimony over Twitter.
At the end of the day, the defense says that in the more than 140,000 of reports on Twitter rape and přivazováním children to their beds in the house, which was a.
On Thursday, held trial Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned for killing three citizens Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and should place the official end to the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But lawyers Mr Hayes has already made an appeal with the requests and arguments to the court, which the Court would probably, the years.
One of the nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process - including the reporters - created a "widespread use of Twitter a circus Atmosphere" and that the enlarged, immediate penetration information with pobuřujícími details then introducing a jury in the decision in terms of influence public opinion.
This claim could force a judge to address the issue, whether with the new technologies, not requiring also new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom's right of a fair trial for the individual," said Thomas J. ullmann, the main defender of Mr Hayes.
Judge of the process by Jon C. blue state Supreme Court ruling briefly refused claims concerning the return of the last week, and with that, that the media were "carefully controlled," and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury has acted under the influence of the public.
But it is probably the last word in this case.
For decades the courts they admitted that the notoriously known cases may cause the questions about the justice process.
In the regulation of the year, the Supreme Court of the United States abolished the condemnation of clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision, said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of the reason of the media were a "karnevalovou atmosphere."
Some are convinced that this crime was an inspiration and the film "The Fugitive" television show.
Some lawyers have said that hayesův judgment about half a century later, by appeals courts, which could be surprised argument, that might be necessary the new rules, which will determine the way of communication from the Court Hall, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a reason for concern about the impact of the new media in highly controlled cases," said John J. donohue III, legal Stanford Law School professor who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report, which said that it was made by arbitrarily.
Professor donohue said, that some of the judges can be pleased with the idea that restrictions on the immediate communication from the courtrooms, it may make the process fairer.
Is only one of the many lawyers outlined the case Twitter Hayes, who would be able to argue years, to desist from row.
Advocates also, for example, says that in the case of Mr Hayes can be a bias, when Judge blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of the potential jurors by them in jury selection resumes criminal photos's horror.
Some of the judges said that they were appalled pictures of the victims, which has become Jennifer hawke-petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse ústavnost the death penalty, and argue that judge wrongly dismissed juror, who has been critical of the state's representatives, and that their decision not put more pressure on the verdict and routed jury, thought to on the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the process can attract most interested in.
Said in the statement of objections against the verdict vzneseném reports in Connecticut and dominated the last month, that case was being discussed during the election campaign of candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
Argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly flames of emotion in the affairs of this case.
"Day of media cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something in New Haven, has not yet been to see and this is perhaps also a national raritu."
Their focus on the twitter is controversial.
Some journalists in the talks said that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the report referred to later and from their point of view should follow the scope of the judicial police other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeals courts with often used the arguments that the social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Lawyers of Mr Hayes seeking to this right.
In its archives referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of the 1966 IN THE MATTER of the Dr. Sheppard, because of the scale of the process and they wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," wrote, "is a case Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
May courtesy to overcome the gap?
Following the campaign, which was its urážlivostí remarkable and negativismem, this week in Washington was small amounts of courtesy.
This is a good sign of true cooperation the two political parties or only iluzivní moment before quick return to a party of the fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of the President's and parliamentary leaders have produced no major discoveries on the crucial issues, which needs to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a polite discussion regarding the differences views of the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibility, rather than another empty episode party contest.
Wednesday public meeting the president's deficit of the Commission was also civilized, and despite political differences that remain between Members.
It seems that it is clear that close cooperation after a period of several months established a mutual respect, which exceeds the ideological divide, which Members still divides.
And it is quite difficult to claim, that started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test period - sondují each other signs of the company and a compromise, while trying to evaluate the borders of public opinion and electoral patience to renewed the party's war.
Therefore was also Tuesday negotiations and his subsequent evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama, and Republicans are too large and too deep to it, to the proposed rapid change situation which is there for the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two parties are in a mile away.
However, the November elections Washington at least prepared quickly.
"The question is not whether the changed regulatory matters," said Pete wehner, Bush's administrator, now in the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You are unavoidable after the elections.
Elections raised emotions straníků and then you utichli.
Is good."
In several issues, especially those that have to discuss at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year and no one that does not see a favourable expired.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of it, and permanent or temporary.
Just as likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans can look at it, as support reducing taxes for the wealthy while the unemployed refuse to support in unemployment.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House is already see greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of a new opening of the Treaty.
But William galston of brookings institution points out that the successful cooperation on the fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of the two political parties, when Congress convenes in January. The 112
Rather it is likely the disagreements, or even the inevitable, he said.
"Then, what do the things that must be done with the psychology in the short term returns to one of the confrontations," said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is to a large extent an extended - courtesy, that will lead to this is real cooperation.
"I'm looking at all what happens between now and the year 2012 as the shadow box, where the main events occur in the year of 2012," he said.
Reasons to a large extent to the Republican majority in the White House and compiling a new voters tea parties, who helped create it.
Republican leaders now faces a danger exaggeration, they know that the government must act according to their promises and to reduce its spending and to cancel a new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in the initial reactions to the recommendation on the deficit, which include the reform of the tax code and some tax increases, raise the retirement age and cut costs.
Common Presidents Alan Simpson and erskine Bowles took the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to his opinion, to put pressure questions to the public deficit programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
Need but 14 votes in 18 členné Commission, so that they can see his plan as the official recommendations and, therefore, that fought the number as close as possible.
The resistance is between the elected officials of the jury, who proposed that in the case of the issues we have, at least now, small foundation or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary Republicans.
The first will start next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans urge Obama to the solution of the budget, taxes and health care, when the more will follow the party's cooperation.
What will drive a shift?
Public opinion.
There are a lot of evidence that despite partisanship in the last elections, most Americans want to continue to see the two parties that are working together.
If could go to the stalemate, as was the case in the year 1995, after both parties will be very closely monitor the public reaction.
Anyone would risk reduction of votes, will probably course and will be looking for a compromise.
That may be an optimistic view on the matter.
Stranickost and guidelines are more today than it was in the 1990s and the indications are that there was greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see the year 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in the year 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, which have occurred this week, would want many Americans.
But many efforts on both sides, this state will be to find common ground on the issues, which is still divided.
Vyzrazený American document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Management of the city is in the hands of "kleptocracy checked" and it continues parts of the bribes and bribes for protection, which are on the way to the kremlinu, gave US Embassy in Russia in the records of February.
Police and federal security service in the rate of holds a protective wing, which help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
Collects money not only from legal business but also from the organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "The Office" - will take their, when the money going to move up the ladder.
Record, which was sent to Washington under the name of ambasadora John beyrleho, was on Wednesday made public by The Wikileaks on their Web site.
Record is based on sources, whose names were redigována.
Record was written at a time when he was mayor of still Yuri luzhkov, accusing it of a large part of the corruption.
Was revoked in October, President of the dmitry medvedevem, but since then we can monitor only minimal changes in cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife yelena baturina, which owns a prominent design company, after many years consistently denied the allegations of corruption, and won several actions for perjury charges for such accusations.
In September, said on Russian television station, when he was asked about the proven testimony about the corruption: "It's crazy, it is dirty, it's crap."
Russians with absolute conviction believes that if their company is corrupt, will show it to the vote.
But it is unusual to meet with such details vyřčenými in such a way, and in ambasádní report, and it is also an unprecedented, that would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
"Moscow City Government and its link with the criminal element, some have led to her called 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government is more like a kleptocracy checked, than as a government," says the report.
"criminal elements are from the world. 'krysha', a term from jail and the mafia, which literally means' roof 'or protection, which gives them the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service, the FSB, the Interior Ministry and the Office of the Attorney General, as well as everywhere in the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in the criminal world Moscow."
"luzhkov is at the top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and militias are on the second level."
"and finally to the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is ineffective system, in which the criminal group fills empty space in some areas, as the city is some provides services."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the biggest firms and the police focuses on the smaller businesses.
One source," said owners of shops in Moscow are aware that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior, rather than from the organized criminal groups, because they do not have only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, there is no protection from criminal gangs and in course."
Record says that while the selection of money is comprehensive, protection of itself, it might have trouble; and, what is true, you can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't fast enough, with their business under different pretenses closing.
Medvedev spoke several times on the fight against corruption, but admitted that he made only a little progress.
Ambasádní report talks about men taking suitcases, probably bulging cash, in the kremlinu.
"in its fight against corruption must rely on medvedev bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview georgy satarov, director of the Moscow indem research team.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"is not part of the political class, because in Russia already political class there are."
Without Opposition politicians, without, without the distribution of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationally is corruption Russia more than $300 billion a year.
Country is on 154. instead of Transparency International in a recent survey on the global Corruption Perception NGO, countries are řazeny from at least after the most corrupt.
The report of the American Embassy, which was in Moscow to certainly arouse the Russian Government enthusiasm in the late evening hours, though only to the extent that can be accused of luzhkov for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be for kremlin way to argue on the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry kingem told Putin that the documents, which published the WikiLeaks could be fake and reacted angrily to a statement that American diplomats call him batman and medvedeva Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we nedomnívali, that it will be carried out with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so neeticky."
Veterans of the Red khmérů are forced to deal with the past
In a dimly lighted a concrete room with zašpiněnými and oloupanými walls reminded school director anlong veng High School of the man who built it, the Khmer Rouge leader the drink.
"All love the moka here."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," he said sreng kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, during the government of Khmer Rouge atrocities, the Khmer Rouge commander in this remote estate in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure still lives and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge gave up the government, she's busted prolonged loyalty also in anlong vengu.
In April was the victims in the forum of Truth and Reconciliation to publicly confront with the people, who were part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time children explain the history of Khmer Rouge leaders and their former soldiers.
And in July to the UN and Cambodia's court together the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge leaders, a conviction of former leader, notoriously known of a violent associations tuol sleng, kaing khek iev, známějšího as spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, rising unrest among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in the anlong veng, which complicates efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to participate in the Cambodian society again.
"between the former Khmer khmery is resentment and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," he said chhang youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life was between the red khmery beautiful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or to reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his soldiers fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There launched the insurgency, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon chea and Ieng Sary followed guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, while the drink, kultivoval supporters in anlong vengu.
But in the 1990s, following the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was conducted for the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of fighters of Khmer Rouge leaders began to move to the Government, which culminated in the surrender Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon chea and Khieu samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes, continues in 1998 and the drink, which was captured by government forces in the nedalých mountains dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom penhském prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their patrons have already nepečovali, most of them former combatants Khmer Rouge sank in the plain of Cambodia's rural life, and many of them nostalgically recalls for movement.
Although a number of elite Khmer Rouge to retain its position as local government in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people should benefit from the surrender only the minimum," said rival leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads public forum across Cambodia, including anlong vengu.
"They are surrounded by utopickou agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were bedside manner without any ideas on the implementation of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who came to the khmerům as a teenager in 1974, and fought in the jungle around anlong vengu before he as a poor farmer in the year 1998.
"life under the Khmer khmery was good," he said.
"The drink, all sustenance."
"But now is a hard life, because we all must ensure themselves."
Ongoing court of Khmer Rouge leaders also provoked concerns.
At the beginning of next year to court to investigate Nuon chea, Khieu samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of Khmer Rouge atrocities.
The Court has a mandate to prosecute the přestavitele and people responsible for the crimes, but has not said whether it will continue also in the four of the cases.
It was only a little, to have been reassured concerns in anlong vengu.
Recent media speculation focused on the IM chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in the province banteay meanchey during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In the year 2007, said the researchers from the Documentation Center of Cambodia, that supervised the construction of dams trapeang thma project, which probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Recent smoking evening IM chaem back from work in the field to its wooden cottage on dirty way out of anlong veng.
As the sun began to walk and explore the shadows over dry grass, im chaem refused to talk about their past the Red khmery.
If it wants to see her Court rejected would go.
"In Cambodia, of peace and it is stable," she said.
"If will be another criminal prosecution, there's going to be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, which he defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that it comes to instability if the court searches for other suspects, although experts and historians do not agree with it.
"Cambodia must dig deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, he said chhang youk from the Documentation Center.
"reconciliation in khmerským circumstances of the means slepení shattered pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to give the broken pieces together, we can understand."
Center, first approved by the Government on the red khmerech, has 75 of the parties and the name of the book "The history of democratic Cambodia."
Was distributed in anlong vengu in June as a supplement to the history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties of the Red khmerech.
As well as many people in Cambodia, also of young people in anlong vengu knew only few details about the khmerech, despite the city with the regime.
Touch valeak, 19, a student at the high school in anlong veng said that the new book helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically, when he took home the book to study.
"My family refuses to many parts of the book and the courts," he said.
"There are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people will be court to prosecute."
A resistance is reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, said rival leang.
But public forum, textbooks and the Court is beginning to have an impact, said further.
The Khmer Rouge here are still strong spell.
Up in the mountains dangrek mountains is the overgrown weeds and vysypaná odhozenými plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered rusty tin roof.
The body, Pol pota here was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31, cell phones on the edge of a road, said she doesn't know a lot about the man, who was at the place cremated.
"But it has a strong spirit, many local people come through here and praying for him," she said.
Nuom sothea should birthday and in the plan later to visit the place where rest Pol pota, will bring a ripe bananas, in the hope that it will bring luck.
Belarus agrees that it seems their stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium
In DID with its surprise victory in the campaign of President Obama on ensuring the nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian Government announced on Wednesday that give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement, issued after the security summit Secretary Hillary rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister by Sergei Martynov.
US government have for years sought to persuade Belarus to relinquishing the highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that the stumbling block discovered last spring.
But US officials have told the Washington Post, that in the past two months with Belarus was carried out a couple of clandestine operations to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research facilities.
That set the stage for Wednesday an agreement for the removal of the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke on condition anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
Agreement has turned out to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th national summit on nuclear security in April, on which the Belarus was taken off the list.
And was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the subsequent summit in the year 2012.
"I was really fascinated with the fact that they want to place on the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012."
"It shows that the process works," said Ken luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group supporting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement as "very important, an important step" from Belarus.
Obama said in Prague in April 2009, that will ensure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world to four years.
Since then, the US government helped six countries to get rid of all of its stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear security, a Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that his nation will never surrender its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is in the essence of the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," he said after Lukashenko.
"It is our commodity... we are not going to produce a dirty bombs and also we are not going to sell it."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, several months ago acceded to the United States and it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to eliminate the Belarusian uranium in October, he was particularly difficult, because the material was slightly ozářen, officials announced.
Was loaded on a special train, which traveled more than 1, 300 miles in the Russian equipment for the storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government for the programme spent 13 million dollars, most of it for the supply of the research institute less enriched uranium, which is for the production of nuclear weapons a statesman.
"Everything was zkoordinováno very carefully and conducted on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew bieniawski, an official of the Ministry of Energy workers for the Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the Study of the non nuclear weapons, this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable for production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, to remove its stocks by the year 2012.
Tense relations between Belarus and the United States have been over the years, and it mainly because of lukašenkově a brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday statement suggests the possibility of gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress in the global security issues, the United States and Belarus to acknowledge that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis of improve mutual relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do with CIA flights secrets
The Spanish Government was not making secrets about CIA flights carrying trapped talibance and members of the al-qaida to Guantanamo over the Spanish territory, as expressed in his telegram Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
So it stems from the documents provided by WikiLeaks newspaper, El País, where he also writes that the First Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa fernándezová de la vegová requested that the Spanish Executive has been informed and could "and to show that it has the proper supervision over foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, after the communication from the Council of Europe, in which it blamed on a dozen states, including Spain of complicity in the violation of human rights, a meeting was held between the US ambassador eduardem Aguirre would never and fernándezovou de la vegovou.
The Deputy Prime Minister, said that the Council of Europe "exempt zapaterovu Government of the game" and insisted on the fact that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la vegová stressed that Spain has no problem with the years ago of the secret services across its territory.
"simply want to be only informed" that they are not "caught off guard," she tells Aguirre would never in one of the documents.
Also the then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel moratinos the American ambassador, he indicated that the Spanish government "wanted to make this matter as perhaps the outlines, but the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judiciary, the government were limited options influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente gonzález told the embassy, that if his concerns, has no intention of blocking the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents, cni of National Center of the secret services and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These information contains no folder or any sensitive information" passage in question, said the embassy after the interview with the Attorney General.

Receive 4 seats in the House and the PSC would gain, the Socialist Party of Catalonia - yes. It lost 9 seats
With the results of the November 28 party pp could have the decisive word on radnicích in léridě, tarragoně and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of senior members during the recent autonomous election katalánská PP, People's Party of Catalonia - yes. Already has the idea of general elections, whether or not, there will be an increase in its prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes in the national election is usually one such compared to elections Catalan.
In the year 2008, have katalánští receive in the general elections 610.473 votes, while this number in the elections of the autonomous from the year 2006 was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, won ppc, People's Party of Catalonia 384.091 voice.
Udrží-li this tendency, which was supported by the transfer of the votes from the PSC increases and loyalty of PA, analysts this party have calculated that if the general elections, ppc could win 12 members from the current 8 in the House, the party ciu, convergencia and unió, Czech agreement and the Union - yes. Would have also 4 mandates, there were now 10 and PSC would lose at least 9 seats, now has 25.
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for the PP and the PSOE, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, of fundamental importance.
According to this analysis lidovců would be a party ERC, left the Republican Party of Catalonia - yes. She lost one members of Green - now has a 3 - while icv, initiative for Catalonia - Yes. should remain one mandate, or would have another one.
However, according to the electoral schedule will take place next appointment in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where they would receive also could have a decisive impact to end domination of the socialists in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Council Barcelona, diputación de Barcelona, which is one of the administrations of the expected budget - 661 million euros for the year 2011.
Both the nationalists and receive agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the City Hall in Barcelona, tarragoně, léridě and geroně, where the Socialists received majority and nor should they could turn to its traditional ally, the ERC and icv.
Given the debacle of Republicans would have been impossible, if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona site - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
Party pp increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive effect in Barcelona, léridě and tarragoně.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a leading role in turnover in the tarragoně where ruled together with the party pp before the current mayor, josepem félixem ballesterosem.
In léridě received pp only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with marianem rajoyem - during the last campaign together on several occasions.
Receive have also on other major radnicích as is badalona, castelldeels or reus.
At present, pp representation at 34 radnicích in Catalonia, and I would create a nominee in what may be the most municipalities.

The broken cell was not the only active, which had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore also other European police forces take part in such an investigation in addition to Thai services, and so could not be ruled out that in the coming days there will be similar intervention in other European countries, like the one in Barcelona last Tuesday in the night.
In the context of this operation, when they were detained for junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and nigerijec babatunde agunbiade was in Thailand developed further, in which they were captured for Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan Ehsan butt and thajec sirikanlaya kijbumrung.

This means that the documents had to be men aged 25 to 45 years, had to have a force of several years and be without highlighted a visa.
In the investigative documents is stressed that so far there are no facts, which would connect the detainees of known of Catalonia with the assassination in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks," lashkar-e-taiba," was supposed to be one of the groups, which received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that several days before that the assassination was sent from of Catalonia conversion by about one thousand dollars, which have been "embedded" to purchase cards to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando," which killed 106 people.

The center olot exclusive, that their clients' minder killed more than 11
Leadership of the geriatrického downtown La caritat de olot, gerona gave a press conference yesterday, to vylíčilo what damage caused institution criminal behavior joana villa dilmé, workers, which - while there was busy - killed at least 11 of the elderly, which had in care.
The Director of this home for the elderly, Joan Sala was accompanied by a lawyer equipment, a lawyer joana Canada, and announced that "the wishes of home La caritat up would be able to press charges against the guilty" responsible for killing, but "the legality and the responsibility to oblige us to let this process to the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name of the institution, which may suffer because of the fact that in time revealed criminal activities of workers, a great threat to the home of the LA caritat are now requirements in the material compensation, which already are calculated the representatives of families of survivors.
Joan villa dilmé admitted that his first crime was already in August 2009 and that from this time stopped killing
Judge has ordered the exhumation of eight bodies home for the elderly clients with a suspicion that personally, but that in many cases neprohlížel dead no doctor - Patient due to age and poor health condition - all vyřizovalo over the phone.
La caritat yesterday, through its director firmly rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not be in any case, the cause of which is."
The legal representative of La caritat added that "in case there are no indications that would be in addition to the defendant's own any third person committed errors."
Man nicknamed now "Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 of the killing and said that the first crime committed 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed another nanny.

The European Central Bank threatens
Investors responded sharply to yesterday's threat from the President of the European Central Bank yesterday Trichet, who pointed out that "the markets should not be underestimated our ability to respond."
Marginal diferenciály closed power and European banks stocks fell by more than 5%.
However, also we should not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to err - Euro had affected just above the critical value.
It to what has happened yesterday, is typical of illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but the short and very speculative positions.
Investor will take some time to lose concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited today to take us back peace liquidity, and tomorrow will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy back the debt for inefficiency and eliminate all emergency liquidity rates in time and keep the unrestricted access only after a period of one week.
After the crisis, we expect that the level of liquidity "at least until March forecast" and followed months licitaci with unlimited access to the end of this session, in order to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
Also purchase bonds and we hope that they will continue to work in his program that even to notify his intensification.
Nenaplní-li created expectations, creates a response markets from yesterday, and if it again and will continue to be blindly continue to download the rate of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the Congress in May, where argued that no thought of purchase of the bonds, and resulted in the collapse of the markets - tomorrow could be history repeat.
The European Central Bank must be credible and steadfast.
Announced in May it locked the fist on Monday, and on Wednesday said that it has already bought many, thereby raised further market collapse.
Yesterday's bidding bills for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro gave only 500 million with 5.28% in comparison with 750 million with the 4.81% from the previous.
Thus so rates in Portugal fell 30 points below odrážejíce and change the mood in the market, to which took place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, was published figures represent a loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated to amount to around 10,000 million short securities and other potential 15.000 in February have the chance to be private capital, or it will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility, then what problems did not reveal stresovými tests in July, amounts are in the framework of the assistance plan acceptable and will help reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain approval of the new budget of the Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so in Ireland remain a uncertainty.
Angela Merkel eased the tone of his speech, to release tensions in the face for the next meeting, the EU held on December 14, the political compromise, which would show, which is to be made that we Union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven: Ode to Joy.
In Spain had the Prime Minister yesterday to present the plan of action, which will be approved in the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous areas and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to boost employment - in the ears of investors that sounds like a four year period from Vivaldi.
A double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish Stock Exchange rose by 4.5%, i.e. double than other European stock exchanges.
To the difference from February was government's response and the Spanish national banks quick and convincing - beneficiaries were from the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key licitaci bond in three years, which Will Be Advantage effect, Trichet, because of which we hope will be a great demand for it, which will help to disperse the doubts about our ability of refinancing.
Demand a rescue plan would be for Spain sacrifice.
They will give us the cash, which we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to the US markets closed sine die.
However, it is important to continue to use cesarovy women - "not only be the strategy, but also with the zdáti."
We can do it.

Sabadell betting on it, that "steals" during the three years of its competitors million clients
More optimistic than other bosses, delegovaný board member banks Banco Sabadell, Jaime guardiola, believes that the year 2011 for the bank will be difficult, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of passive war.
Yet is a reduction of interest rates, which are but will try to compensate for the slevněním bank charges and prices of the loans.
Sabadell, it is expected that he will obtain a million private clients over three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and can survive in the tough economic conditions.
Bank starts a new strategic plan with effect for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to the survival without having to resort to a public assistance in frob, gain market share podchycením million new private clients - 700.000 respectively, odečtou-li, those who leave or bank - as until now ai Institute coddled small and medium entrepreneurs and large companies rather than small clients.
This year has already had Bank 250,000 private clients and 50,000 enterprises.
Its share of the market is, if it is a private clients 3.5%, while the corporate customer is more than 10%.
Another of the fundamental ideas plan 2011-2013 is commitment to the productivity, or can you say also realistic, with a view to reducing costs, whose challenges to the bank, and will present the results for the period.
In this time, few of banking institutions capable of set the goal and publish is, since the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell shut its program declined this year, laid down four years ago, although he had been to three years, but the situation in the markets require extension for a further period.
Clients, who go from savings, will be their main target group.

And although believes that passive war - which reduces the receding margins -, price increases for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions, to obtain liquidity, is already on the prices of credit, which compensates reducing the margin.
"the subject of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor on credit."
"We have entered the trigger, but diferenciály are very high," acknowledged the guardiola.

After assurances that Sabadell may continue to survive the temporary closure of markets, it represents a serious problem, what some bankers predict as new liquidity crisis.
Notes that cannot be issued, but on the contrary, what was in June, it is possible to receive the short funding through the repurchase rate, which reduces the crisis.

Tension in the markets of a double the government response.
On one side of the proposed José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from a reduction in taxes for small and medium sized enterprises, over the regulation of private agencies or lifting 426 euro for the unemployed without benefits, to privatize 49% of the aena, Spanish airports and air traffic management - Yes., manager of airports barajas and El prat and 30% of the national lottery.
Of the Elena salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe gonzáleze, on the other hand, join the reviews to address Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret this emotion?
It has to be said in advance that the opinion of Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process redefinice of the euro.
And here, Germany has radically new vision of what is supposed to be its future, which faces the idea of compliance with the old traditions, which holds a big part of the other members.
In the face of the European opposition in Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of them is a strong eurozone, of which would be just part of Germany, but also for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the South States monetary zone would quit.
The other is a return to the mark - although it may seem as scifi now, this version has broad support from the public, close to 50% of the population.
A third option is under German proposals recasting of the euro, with more macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary severity, fines for guilty States, potentially delaying payments for some of them, and with the expansion of the possible costs for a regulation on the private sector.
German position is clear and already defines some time, so there is no room for evasion by now.
First, when in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission to promote deficits, pulled out of a German Government of constitutional reform, to prevent them from the year 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what it considered Germany right, fiscal stringency plans and stability of the public finances, and this what were his European partners, including France.
The other showed the Central European country, when Merkel sorely protahovala decision on the rescue of Greece.
At that time was the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus and public opinion, which was also published in Germany, have been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, days, Merkel once again appeared in the last October with a clear point of view, when called for reform of the Convention of the European Union, so that the purposes of salvation of a Member State, and at the same time, to private creditors have a duty to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as opposite of Europe, as accelerate the crisis and all the others.
But the proposal, although in a zmírněné form, was approved, and during the next few months, we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany took a red line, which will not exceed.
And all that tells us, although it is now to be done measures, which seems to be too disagree, starting from this date will be the end to an old functioning of the euro.
Year 2013, will be the birth of a new currency zone, in which states that violates rules will be hard penalised and may be forced to announce postponement payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests that we need to give us a strict way to increasing the rate of savings and investment, the moderate consumption growth, improve the productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
No choice based on the claims, and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, what was in the years of boom growth of Spain, simply not tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we made a mistake, we have not understood this.
It is not only about the renewal of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
It, what they want us to do, is much harder.
And the worst thing is that, under these conditions would happen to us, that the zmýlíme themselves.
I hope that these more calm will replace the current turbulence.
And that we will take the opportunity that they give us into the spring 2013.
It seems that this Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and his double statement after meeting with big enterprises from the reforms promised last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures, it suggests that over criticism of Merkel opened the way to the idea that there is a need to put things in order.
But the Red line, which Germany itself, there is, and it does not appear that would like to move with her.
AND OF THE options, over which can be considered, leaving the euro area full of less serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to say that The US warned. US
Sport and circumvent rules
Tricks that gave Alonso and Ramos in the match with ajaxem show savvy, not the intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly zosnovaná exclusion of two players Real Madrid, xabiho alonsa and collections Ramos of the Champions League in the match against ajaxu from 23 November caused ink, that was dumped into the sea, about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether at UEFA should not punish both football players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match, which had their team clearly vyhraný appointed players one after the other deliberately losing time at the moment when the was playing a foul, so as to provoke sudího, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, the two players will fulfil the prescribed punishment in the following match against auxerre - with Real Madrid will end in their group at the forefront of - and, deprived of the cards, will be able to continue on to the next phase.
At the end of the day, the trenéru a UEFA disciplinary commission José mourinhovi punishment in two games and errant players got a cash fine.
Provoking the yellow cards in similar circumstances, there is no new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
Is so widespread that is part of the ethos of football, so the rules, which are an unwritten, but are watching.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was team Real Madrid, which is in its hymně boasted about its šlechetností and honour, and which has already for similar actions of his players pokutoval, and as it seems, also thanks to the drama of the mourinhem, which added to its long history of model and a provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of negotiations, which is expressly prohibited rules, so is in violation of the principles of sport, whether in these deeds are respecting sporting rules to circumvent the law; it is indeed a Action, whose sense, however, as it seems, trying to get by.
Solve is, what kind of damage such negotiations are sports spirit.
One of the requirements sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not violated, or to avoid violent game in these cases.
Another one of these requirements charakterizujících clean game is to prevent players due to its offence had an advantage over team opponent - to which also took place here.
So the players in action, Real Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, what normally charakterizujeme as a trick or circumvent the law, there is a secret breach of rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this behavior should be what is most evident in order to receive the punishment.
Got wait and like a punishment.
Another question, however, is what benefit the guilty of its deliberate violation will have.
It should be noted here that opponent is in a disadvantaged position, and that in the current game can't get no benefit, as an obvious effect is that the team itself will have less players.
And it is not useful strategy in the next game, as the club will not be able with these players count.
Advantage clearly lies in the fact that players will start another phase of the Champions League without cards, which could affect their participation in the future the match.
But it is The advantage in the long term and with a degree of uncertainty, therefore, at first glance, this may be team eliminated, and outside this process will have players punishment and move into the second round of cards, in which about one card is enough to exclusion less than in the first round.
So how will the round continue, will not be fully clear, whether it is the advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against sporting spirit, part of which is to make the strategic decision, to get the maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the case, which we are dealing here with should not players for target to avoid the penalty, which would be a clear case circumvent the rules, but rather had chosen, when to obey him.
Have made a strategic decision, without stay out of punishment or before him out.
Although borders between wit and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that, in this case, it was clearly a savvy.
It seems to me that a polemic is fueled by two reasons: because this was a two samovyloučení and because of the way it has instructions to transfer their provocation from the leadership.
Damage sports principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.

Pakistan's nuclear program produced great unrest in the US
, Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "at a higher rate than any other country."
Documents WikiLeaks confirm links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US department published the portal WikiLeaks confirms the unrest, which inspires the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the objasňujících and important details, which offer on the content of communications and ideas of representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, reveal these documents, that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety, instead, to increase," is on the wane "and that this unstable South Asian country produces nuclear weapons" more than any other state."
Trait of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but the store after works, to be znesnadněna Their Destruction in case of an attack - vigilance is one of the main reasons for Washington.
This calculated Ambassador in Pakistan, says Anne W. Patterson in one report executive in advance of the visit of the then National Security Adviser for James Jones: "proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged diversion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials."
An increased number of persons linked to the nuclear arsenály and with the US missile programme is not already observed only, but also Russia as a pervasive and a reason to be on the lookout.
"Pakistan had to the protection of nuclear equipment to hire staff with the strict religious beliefs; due to the decline of their level of education and culture have extremist organizations, more opportunities recruit people, who will work in the nuclear or missile programmes," said Yuri korolev expert from the Russian foreign ministry at a meeting with his counterparts from the US.
The biggest new dossier published by Julian assangeho is becoming less and less of cooperation between the US and Pakistan in issues of nuclear weapons and increased the pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Trap Embassy issued in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "There is no transparency often; offers of assistance remain without a response or are rejected."

Ambassador pettersonová also asks Washington to during the visit of Chief of Staff General ashfaqa kayaniho "Very well make clear" that "the Pakistani army must end with a quiet support to terrorist groups."
Hunt to Chief of WikiLeaks
Obama called senior official responsible for the fight against terrorism, to avoid new leakage of information.
Interpol issued "red Challenge" with a view to track down and determine where the assange could be.
Everything on the WikiLeaks and its founder Julian assangeho are complicated the labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday "The emergency call," the red notice, to "lokalizování and monitoring the movement of" assangeho.
But it is not a classic command to detention.
Besides, the challenge is not new, but dating back to the 20th November.
And has nothing to do with the last of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, facing australan in Sweden.
Next to that assures the legal representative of the WikiLeaks mark stephens, that "the police know where and how the contact with the assangem."
This was the 20th November, when the international police based in the French Lyon gave this order at the request of Sweden, nezveřejnil, however, until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
For this situation has 188 countries Interpol guidelines to identify or location of the assangeho "with a view to impose temporary custody and give it to him."
Although Interpol cannot to order the detention of persons, which concerns the red challenge, but many of the Member States, explained how the organization, as the red notice for police to arrest to make - it must be ensured national component - especially in the case when countries are mutual agreement on the issue of the detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where they apparently had assange be.
Its sales fell assengeho lawyers, who published yesterday by writing this step, where claim that devětatřicetiletý founder WikiLeaks has shown willingness to answer questions Swedish authorities using video conferences.
Remind also asked that assenge and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prokurátorky its case, compare that with the legendary lavrentijem pavlovičem berijou, head of Stalin's security.
"This is the hunt and not legal pursuit," the letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and from Australia, his mother the innocence of his son - assange is away to an unknown place, but nemlčí.
On Monday gave an interview via Skype from an unknown place šéfredaktorovi Time magazine - in this interview Hillary Clinton called for the resignation of Secretary of State of the United States.
"If that was responsible for order US diplomats to carry out spying in the United Nations and broke and International Convention, which signed the United States, should step down," he said.
His view was refused yesterday the White House spokesman Robert gibbsem who qualify to request demise as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure, why should we depend on the opinion of individuals, which operates a Web page in a CNN," he said.
Obama himself instructed the senior official responsible for the fight against terrorism, rusella traverse, to avoid further evasion of documents.
Barack Obama stop add assangemu intention speaker, President on the importance of contrasts with the views, which claim conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress, which will be chaired by the Committee for National Security in the lower house since January, asked the Foreign Ministry to look into the possibility of including WikiLeaks between terrorist organisations," in order to intervene and prosecute anyone who would provide them financially contribute or otherwise aid."
Further went the flanagan, Advisor to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen harpera, who said that assange should "be killed," which subsequently had to appeal.
"Obama was launching a reward would be on him or use unmanned plane or something like that."
Who was the apologies, Mike huckabee, a Baptist minister, former guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for president.
"Anyone will be in the government, the one who is responsible for the leakage of information, has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too modest," he said at the station Fox
Puigcercós searches the ERC quiet "Twinkle" on followers of caroda
Republican leader will allow the secret vote on its remaining.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end of schůzovního system.
Joan puigcercós apparently found a recipe, how to fight with already advised many internal upheavals in the ERC, left the Republican Party of Catalonia - Yes., bezvýslednou because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
Leader of the party is aware that his gesture on to seems to supporters of the former leader Josep lluíse caroda-roviry insufficient, and also knows that the influence of this sector is now already weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely does not do so worried, which he had with other zaniklými currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will seek to gain a new criticism by pomrkávání, which will help create him in the municipal elections.
First puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to secretly to speak on his remaining in office.
Using the ballots, rather than by a show of hands.
If they want the caroda to the chairman of a voice, will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact boss, wants to avoid division and surrender their people.
In several interviews, argued that would, in addition, did not consider it endorsed with half of the votes and one, but he added, without percent, said that he would also be a good outcome "for Bulgaria."
Supporters of the caroda demand after the president more than to give its function, available - which are considered to be a gesture, which has no weight, as puigcercós controls on sjezdech the largest authority.
But due to the fact that they do not have a sufficient majority to be able to enforce demise, will try to remind Executive plan from now on until May.
Expect, because of the fact that will take part in drawing up the document of the strategic reorientation, of which might leadership vote the National Council of the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to promote puigcercóse in exchange for it, that this promises the Congress already in the autumn of 2011.
A leader of the ERC said that "mnohohlasnost" is detrimental to the stability, and that his objective is to once and for all the organization was able to fight their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, seems to be that article, which the current advisor, Josep huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account the puigcercósův ideolog this advisor for innovation has taken a fait accompli, that leader will be confirmed "in exchange for a few goals."
And those named five, two of which excel.
The first is "překomponování executive," so that was at least 90% of the members, which means also to include new faces, who are from the friendly carodovi.
The second objective may be big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC Completely End schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for the reform of the statutes, to be held congresses through delegates selected the vote.
Doing away with the model schůzovního system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is intended to puigcercósova team, which fought already in the last two sjezdech in this respect.
However, a meeting of the year 2008, decided that the schůzovnictví must be assessed at a special congress on reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still nevyřízená, as the situation within the party dissuaded from dealing with this issue.
Now, lurking without critical sectors, could be the appropriate time again to address this issue and try to close it once and for all.

From infektologa is convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my morning."
Finally, after the frustration with traumatologem, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but he explained that the wound is not scientific term, it's a shrink, which reveals the secret: "Is it really is open and the symbolic scar morning."
Protagonistka odlehčeně sighed and came to the conclusion that "the blow it managed to know only so much that it is really open, and that there is no," but had the belief that the pleasure and dangers in the language must go hand in hand with each other.
Writer valenzuelová played with both.
Nikaragujec Sergio ramírez also spoke with cute story, which called the praise of invention, in which there is no finger in the wound appointed, but at one point to show up.

Said that in the world, who lives in a hurry, also in intellectual, customs and the control of consciousness, which is dogmatismy, forgets to it," that behind every přitakáním is small and not for each denies is also small, yes."
"To be masters of our ideas and reality we must přibarvovat: and přibarvovat means many times put finger into the wounds and harass those individuals who are much more comfortable as they did in karikaturách, black and white, in zafixovaných ideas and without trouble hue, and also the authority of this black and white, which prefer the world," he said, to support the sense of writing.

450 nasmlouvaných million without public tenders
Hydro-québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies of providing engineering at hydroelektrický project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
In the heart of this avalanche more than 100 contracts it is generated from companies bpr, dessau, Groupe standard and axor consortium, which received the most important contract, a contract for the management of the whole project at a total cost of 295 million dollars without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the energy gérance was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the selection of the company hydro-québec were committing to the private sector to their responsibility for this important hydroelektrického management project in the value of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of the year 2005 "energy consortium gérance" received lucrative contract without any announcement of public competition.
For quebeckou side a complaint to a consortium of businesses from the US puts the serious problem of ethical nature, which risks exclusion of competition and will cause price increases.
"It is a new way to realize the koluzi and destroy the competition."
"This means that people, now the agreement they secretly, now it is done openly," said yesterday, a member of the PQ sylvain simard at a news conference.
A little earlier in the morning, M. simard put this issue of national assembly, as he says, is that upset, how can be sold public interest as follows.
Minister for Natural Resources, nathalie normandeau, afternoon, vigorously popírajíc, said that it was for this contract koluzi.
"I have my own way," she bellowed, and claimed that she PQ was "dishonest" and "lack of accuracy."
Said, that "it would be the least" that would be the PQ apologized.
Recipe to create a Consortium is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a Alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or several companies to regroup their mutual expertisy, so that they can respond to the call for tenders for a comprehensive project.
Eastmain project is a very complex with regard to obsáhlost work.
Construction is already running and must be scheduled by the year 2012.
However, the contract was awarded, without the Competition Act; it was business.
We also have to admit that formulka consortia is no longer in Quebec exception, and that even a relatively simple projects.
Le devoir as revealed last week, formulka consortia in the field of advice in engineeringu is the subject of an investigation in the government.
Přelétneme-li speed in the trade register quebeckých firms, this will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be created as a career.
The company dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; think of cima + génivar, snc-lavalin and roche and tecsult.
Any combination of, and there are dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is dessau.
If this is a consortium of energy gérance, Minister of normandeauová underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of the LA baie James is typical special dynamism of the labour force and that hydro-québec is already responding to her from the years."
The main patron of the project eastmain, réal laporte from energy companies baie James, sebj, handed the explanation, which US forces svraštit face the fact that the Treaty on management of the project was completed by mutual agreement.
"If you're going to public competition and if there are few participants competition lodging offer, your offer may be higher prices."
"You have a choice of two possibilities: i.e. that grab people, who plays a role in the contract as participants competition, and that say:" Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price. "
"But the main idea is not that important price, but the competence of the people," said Mr. laporte.
The Treaty granted a consortium energy gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50 000$, which received the Party of Quebec.
Contracts have been concluded with companies hydro-québec or sebj on the eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert project.
After verification of Le devoir counted 109 contracts on the advice of the industry engineeringu, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their branches, especially with the Laboratories carrying out analysis of samples of soil.
Snc-lavalin collected 22 contracts, from the génivar 14 of them won 16, tecsult and dessau 10, without should share in the "energy gérance."
All contracts have been concluded.
Together the amount to $449 783 344, including a contract with energy gérance to $295 131 564.
Sylvain simard suggested that the four companies, which are part of a consortium, bpr, dessau, Groupe standard and axor are "very good friends of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister normandeauová also released a report that PQ is associated with the companies, which it "finance" before stressed that this is more about its management staff.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
A Quebec trusted consumer very few actors of sustainable development, but also "impartial" marks and environmental certificate, to it, that it was in the selection of products.
The worst of it is that even if the koupeme space in the media, which urges and calls on us to socially responsible consumption, lamenting the media space over the lack of credible information, even as a brake failure to fulfil obligations, which qualifies for its commitment, says baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article was published yesterday.
Even if in the year 2010, for example consumption increased socially responsible products, the people of Quebec, who is trying to sell, is still too doesn't believe them
Two thirds of us in fact say companies that don't trust promises, relating to the environment, simply because that green advertising companies, establishes the measurement instrument, which has drawn up the observatory Responsible university in sherbrooke consumption.
Other findings: half of consumers has doubts about the credibility of official certificate, přikládaných to for example fair products, but also on the credibility of the products and brands that are referred to as the environmentally responsible, says barometre.
In the same way and debate politicians on this topic is seen as a serious only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information about the responsible consumption, however, seems to be key for this page stimulate consumption activity in the current time, almost one third of the quebeckých consumers.
Really, vacuum and questionable nature of the information would alleviate the enthusiasm 46% of consumers.
It is the second brake, which identified the baromètre after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population of quebekuse builds suspiciously against frequent data on the products that we're looking for, or "green" services, to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in the year 2010, almost half of consumers was willing to change their habits and especially to change one or several products, which would respond to mark their beliefs.
As much as 61% of them upřednostňovalo purchases at traders from their neighborhood and gave priority to purchase food grown in their region, says baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - Responsible Consumption reached 64 of maximum 100 index for this year -, homo consumus québeku I presented as the King of recycling, who works for the lowest possible impact on the environment by that cares for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remain somewhere outside their car, says baromètre: in the year 2010, when 28% of the population of Quebec said that use public transport or that recommended the use of the car to run at least two persons, in order to protect nature.
Walking and round also supported the on 39,1% of the participants of a comprehensive survey of behaviour, who used this rhetoric.
State loan to buy back the cinemas excentris
The Government of Quebec, which we have asked for financial participation to buy back the cinemas excentris by Angus et le parallèle, agrees the deductibles, but only to a height of loans.
Developperská "Angus et le parallèle" Company, which focus on the gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy back's cinematographic complex on the boulevard saint-laurenta and that has proved its mission as a lover of film art, it did not, what has requested.
The government accepts the fact that will be included in the dossier, but on their own terms.
Rather than expected gift suggests the government of Quebec, the amount of which would also was lower, a loan was the original expectations, which could build a resource for a viable solution for favourable conditions and arising from the state.
The first action plan and the request to 12.8 million has already been rejected quebekem last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and Plan of Action sent st-pierre President of the Society for the development of business in the culture minister, sodec, François macerola view, who manages the cinematographic project excentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But counter proposal government came to the company sodec on Tuesday.
The parallèle and Angus have time to 31 December to it, to respond.
However, it seems that hypothesis gift from the State must be really rejected.
Let us, that the grouping of cinemas and cinematographic Center in Quebec was built against the direct investment of the State, that it was possible to buy back excentrisu, usuzujíc, that the Minister of Culture does not have to fund the project on real estate, if it did for other kinosály.
But a number of participants in the discussions, on the contrary, dožadovalo major economic aid.
Daniel langlois, owner, got to the place of their film art cinemas in ten years after he financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the revision of the Council from the financial state.
Halls for independent films is a shortage in the montréalu, and excentris could get a steady clientele.
Company Angus et le parallèle, with Christian yaccarini in his head, director of the Campaign for the release of funds to the private sector, in the belief that allow the 700 000$ for protlačení acquisitions.
Since the spring 2009, one of the three film companies, le parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for excentris.
The future acquirer is open to all three rooms on 27 February next year and showing the most beautiful film xaviera Beauvois men and gods.
But Christian yaccarini not made any reference Le devoir and so ignored, so he and his group think on proposals for reducing, which are made him.
Drawn up curtain to Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic US sources mentioned in the known through a WikiLeaks reveal that what the United States consider inferiority complex Canadians against the Americans, but the same strike reveal their sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that on every Canadian voters lies at the heart of kanadsko-americké relations, when they are to vote, and believes that the visit of President Obama helped the Conservative government to its budget was adopted in the year 2009.
Four new messages between which were American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, landed yesterday to show to the public, moreover, provide sensitive details, with each other to go "under the skin."
Communication with the date, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the 22 September 2008, at which point the United States are not part of the betting, on which discussed the political leaders.
To the surprise, US ambassador in Ottawa, David wilkinse.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanation to this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý, makes possible political leaders to it, to talk about the internal betting, a place to realise that these elections include the United States, as the free trade in the campaign in 1988," writes.
"The United States is a" closed, "the elephant in these elections: the ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening, than to talk about them."
Ambassador means that "An instant later silence" on less, that the two countries keep the intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability to candidate, parties or even better, head of the control these important relations should be a key factor that voters have in mind, when they go to elections."
Another expression of the sense of the importance of can we read the report, sent by Terry breese on 22 January 2009, Chargé d 'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa Barack Obama on his first visit to ottawy, preparing for the President.
"Your trip will help ensure the preservation of the government at the time of the vote of confidence at the beginning of February, on the federal budget deficit, which Canada publicly admit its first for more than ten years, because of the recovery plan at a rate of 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes M. breese.
There's no mention of the fact that the Government had to shelve Christmas session of the Parliament, that cannot be slaughtered coalition, and that the opposition parties will determine their survival quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by the Ambassador wilkinsem, warned Washington in increasingly negativnější picture, which shed dramatic series of broadcast on cbc on the United States.
Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which can be seen not too ingenious references to the maher arar," no-fly-list "Or on kidnappings for purposes of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Another report presenting a that, in their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton said its French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to accept some of the prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of "case by case."
At the end of meeting, it says," to a piece of paper, on Omar khadr 15-letého a Muslim Canadian origin, State Secretary."
"Secretary adopted with the fact that the review."
Poznamenejme finally, that the persons concerned by the WikiLeaks, sweat.
The flanagan, a former adviser to the very, very close stephenu harperovi, said in the waves cbc, that the person responsible for this massive flight should be "destroyed."
Rozhlásilo it and heard about it, and Mike huckabee in the United States.
World plan to restore lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun plan for the reconstruction of domestic lighting, lighting, business and industrial area in 100 countries with a view to reducing greenhouse effect, ges, which equates to almost one third of further restrictions on the climate, which is to be achieved for the stabilisation of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is in a stage of large concrete projects, which the UN wants to push through in Cancun, to kompenzovala the absence of difficult to viable commitments to reduce on the industrialised countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if red light bulbs, which still monopolizují 50 to 70% of the market, will replace bulbs fluokompaktními or, better yet, bulbs with elektroluminiscentními diodes, del or "ice" in English, the big quantity of 1.8 billion tonnes, gt, ges on the planet incurred due to the lighting would odbouralo emissions.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
Is it the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, the big countries with significant on issues such as the United States, Canada, China, Europe and others, between them involved in the voluntary plans to reduce the, which should allow the reduction of global ges of 53 gt on 49 GT.
But will be deducted from the record of five more GT, to be achieved by the year 2020 stabilizing climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius to be excluded, that doesn't get out of control.
In luminous sheets bulbs 95% of the energy to disperse in the form of heat and the rest, including. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluokompaktními bulbs energy consumption reduces about 75%, and with new bulbs with del zredukujeme this consumption twice more.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs can stand on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New light bulbs with del, such, which said this week in the production Philips - this company was allegedly involved in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes about 80% less energy than hot lamp, which gives us an idea about the possible savings with the compensation plan, which would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs can also work with reostaty and emit less heat.
And contain no mercury.
A number of experts expressed reservations about the fluokompaktním light bulbs, because they contain mercury and is to be separate as dangerous waste, which still is not possible in the developing countries, unless producers would set up sběrny.
But, as the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions is not fluokompaktní light bulb, but rather on the planet Mercury thermal coal power plants that emit many needed for the production of electricity promrhané in luminous sheets bulbs.
Only in the United States these center put into circulation of 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
Report also detail says profits, which would be from this international programme of each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations, whose construction would have cost 2.5 billion
Ivory Coast awaits the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary General, Ban ki-moon, he demanded immediate public disclosure of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast after the expiry of the time limits.
"Secretary General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission has completed its work and immediately announced preliminary results, stressed the spokesman of the President of the United Nations."
"calls on all parties in Ivory Coast and institutions, to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative to notification makeshift results."
Despite the pressures being developed some foreign governments left the Election Commission after its date - Wednesday midnight - without published the results, three days after the skrutiniu on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President cei in TV, confirmed that the Commission "continues to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday, in the whole world challenges have proliferated to cei finally declared the winner of the second round, between outgoing laurentem gbagbo and a member of the opposition alassanem ouattara.
But the camp gbagbo relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" vote in the north, which the new army, fn, manage former rebels from the failed the coup in September 2002.
Pascal affi n 'guessan, Director of the presidential election campaign, in Ivory Coast confirmed that the manoeuvres intimidation of voters, which interned FN, the new army, to the north of the country, deter followers of President Ivory Coast from it to go to vote.
Elections could be rescinded if the Constitutional Council would account for complaints, which handed the gbagbo.
However, the President gbagbo opponents have considered that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral, because it is controlled by Paul yao n 'dré, very close political ally of President gbagbo.
Alassane ouattara, one of the north, which dementuje any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in reporting the results as "unacceptable" and asked the gbagba, that is respected, but didn't go so far, that would be said victory.
His allies confirm that gbagbo blocking publication of the results, because he knows that suffered a loss of, and that to lodge a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after he refused to broadcast Election Commission results, it would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, ongoing in Sunday, was considered the coronation the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which for years has been split in two half.
The United Nations highlighted in the center of the political faction Ivory Coast, that could be made responsible for any violence.
Laurent gbagbo ended in the first round, 31 October as the winner with 38% of the votes, compared to 32 percent for alassana ouattaru, who received the public support for the former president henriho konan bédié by 25% in the first round.

Case clotilde exaggerated reiss: elysejský palace mediation to Syria
During the more than ten months, from July 2009 in May 2010, deal klotildy reissové, young research worker arrested in Iran for "espionage, United views in France," said diplomacy to alert status and highlighted the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored diplomats from the United States.
US documents, received by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of the crisis.
Describes how elysejský palace explained its strategy, with the Americans, that gave them the Council, went so far as to handle such cases hostages in Iran by a small group výletníků.
Show, as French leaders try to convince Washington that the release of young French compensation was not against the release of majida kakavanda, the Iranians are vězněného in France and searched the American injustice for illicit trading with material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, concerning a sharp light the way the French Presidency to manipulate the media, to akreditovali idea, that the Syrian president, bachar al-assad played a central role in the klotildy reissové.
In fact, for it didn't do nothing.
Diplomatic telegram as detailed on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a headline: "Iran: the French comments to the solution in the case of the hostages."
Advisor of the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François richier, accompanied by Director of the quai d 'orsay for North afrikua Middle East, Patrice paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomacy allegrone.
He explain French method.
Recommend to do this as much for the Americans to be shipped back to the country of their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Do the," they say, "constantly strongly vyslovujte" in the media, the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It is necessary to bring to the difficulties the Iranian regime, sensitive to their image.
"Do it the more, the more you will be asked to stop" with it.
Because attempts were made on negotiations through discrete channels," Silence will not solve the problem," the Iranians are "masters on Evasive maneuvers."
Mr. richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners is "the Iranian family tactic: hostage taking for the" political blackmail."
Announces that the klotildy reissové, which will come on August 16, the French Embassy in the day, when she will provide refuge." will require payment high amounts of money the Iranians "by the 230 000 euros.
And to report that elysejský palace anticipates this cases of hostages phenomenon, which "will be vyostřovat."

28 August 2009.
Klotilda reissová left the prison for 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: íránec majid kakavand, on which the United States claim that he was deported for illegal trade in Electronic Materials In Paris the sensitive in relation to Iran, is released on the basis of the decision of the judge.
American Embassy as well as many observers queries on this worrying match.
For Washington, which follows illegal Iranian network to obtain material destined for the nuclear program is the opening majida khakavanda bad news.
France accepted to bargain?
The Iranians for the liberation of young French?
In another interview with Kathleen allegrone, September 4, François richier assured that this is not the case.
Elysejský palace, as it says, was not only "shocked by this decision," but he was looking for a chance to judge how to stand up against it.
"There have been talks between the Presidency and the Minister of Justice," at the time, the michèle alliot-marie, but "the French government could not change the decision of the court," notes.
Mr. richier wants also to demonstrate that majid kakavand is "limited" under the supervision of the French intelligence services.

Americans are watching this activity not without irony and find that the bears its fruits, because several articles in the press reflects the French official version.
Telegram on 25 August 2009 evokes a media "blest" the French officials."
What is based on this level of "gratitude," expressed to M. assadovi, asked the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of chvalořečí French Official officials in the privacy of recognise that they have only vague idea about what haul in fact did."
Document then deals with the reasons that forced the elysejský palace to pay in the fiction.
Intensive communication "is heading to validate President Sarkozy's opening up to Syria" policy, analyses.
Policy applied in the year 2008," was observed many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved."
The way," exaggerating the Syrian role," the Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria, What can I vysloužit, chvalořeči when plays a constructive role in the area."
It also aims to "to plant grain this excitement between Syria and Iran."
American Embassy it knows of very good resources.

End of online games after midnight for young they
South Korea's government will adopt a law, called "peciválský," which prohibit adolescentům play online games, after midnight, that block access to them, responsible government officials said.
The draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he can ask companies operating online games for blocking access to these Games after midnight to anyone under 16 years old, said leaders of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
"Many of the children with learning plays these Games all night and then have problems in school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We do not believe that this law is necessary for it, so that it could be ensured their health and their right to sleep," he said to AFP Yeah Rin, senior official at the Ministry, which is in charge of the bill.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 hours in the morning.
Companies will have one year to it, to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also assumes that asking the company to reduce daily time access to these games for the young, whose parents on this request, said owner.
It can also free programs available to people who request it, to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by the "and" the daily press brings regularly different facts associated with intensive use of the Internet.
Country is at the same time undisputed master of the world competitions in the online games.
In November of South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, and that in the face of 58 other nations.
World Cup in years 2018-2022: FIFA establishes the host country.
Full of unrest on suspicion of corruption provides for the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in years of 2018 and 2022, the most politically motivated, where the battle for influence and lobbying run the risk that will prevail over the technical criteria.
Thing is sure of the Royal competition FIFA in the year 2018se will take place in Europe, the traditional strongholds of this discipline, 4 candidates: England, Russia, španělsko-portugalsko nizozemí-belgie.
Championship in the year 2022 will be much more exotic, while International Federation hopes that it will be able to conquer new territory, Qatar, Australia, after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010, or continue to work in the introduction to the United States or to the east, Japan, South Korea.
List of figures that will participate in the delegation, David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, beckham, cruyff gives the possibility of creating an idea of the scale of the economic and political bets all over the world.
Negotiations in the wings faces the risk that will last until the last minute.
For the rest of it is difficult to establish the hierarchy according to candidates.
According to the assessment report, FIFA documentation, the English španělsko-portugalská, 2018, and American, 2022, contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons would not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of for the vote.
Sunday Times to the early detection, leading to a suspension of two members of the CE/the European Commission?/for corruption, reynald temarii et Amos Adam. Maybe that destroyed the chance to their country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Championships just once, in the year.
In Monday's Crown when the BBC this broadcast a documentary, which "pierced the European Commission? pin" Three influential members of the CE, Ricardo teixeira, Nicolas leoz and issa hayatou.
To make the FIFA nespokojenou and bring to the trouble English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
Prime Minister hopes that he can repeat move, which worked his predecessors as Tony Blair, which in 2005 was able to get to London the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
This intensive activity will suffice to England added a new color his name at the CES, the European Commission??
Nothing is less certain, because the two španělsko-portugalsko Miss trumps already prepared stadiums, his advice, world championships in 1982 in Spain, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, euro-2004 in Portugal, and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial perspective of both countries could give these ambitions of the cold shower.
Possible reprisals against angličanům and doubts about the competence of Spain and Portugal only enhance the position of Russia, which was outsider in spite of the gaps in his dossier, stadiums, hotels, transport.
But Prime Minister Vladimir poutin decided, that the nepřemístí into, Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in preparing the vote," in the words of innuendo just barely gnarled to English press charges against members of the CE mark by the European Commission.
"We will be after them, we'll try to throw the mud is a means to compromise herself," the poutin said.
For the year 2022 appear to be a logical favored to win the United States with their extensive experience of the year 1994.
The performance of the economy in the world, home of the main sponsors of the FIFA, it seems that this country has a large ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, produce the beautiful project.
But these candidacy to be premature for the two countries, which together in the year 2002 has had "test."
Another threat: the 2026: China, which he very much wants FIFA World Cup, has made the Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With katarem, which pulled out of a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion in new lands, but the two countries are more risk than securities.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for a weak charges TV, because of a move by the European countries, comprising a driving force for FIFA.
The second mandate: zřejmost, security,
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand gave the appearance that hesitate.
Valery Giscard d 'Estaing and Jacques Chirac nezaváhali not in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The mandate of elysejskému palace calling someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in the year 2012.
But zřejmost is good in conformity with the share secret associated with hold functions.
So we need to do, as would doubt continuation of constantly.
In one and in the second sense.
In the year 2006, without the wanted to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac to make claims to a third mandate has been excluded.
15 November with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that "decides sometimes in the autumn" by 2011.
As recalls before Members of the Parliament the UMP on Wednesday evening in the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" planted little frenzied state.
It was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not far from it.
President only reminded that the modification of the constitution in 2008 would limit the number of five years of functional period to two.
It was on his side just a statement, no announcement.
This is not the first time that recalls in such meetings humorným tone of presidential elections.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have before you even seven and a half year with me," he said in July 2009.
The rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think that that neuvažuji on the next stage."
His předvčerejší statements it will make the candidate more than the previous day; do not make him a candidate or less.
If make comments, it is because of the double the truth.
Accelerating roads to the candidacy to the PA, on the one hand.
But this is not the entrance into the arena ségolèna Royal, what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is therefore, that his candidacy in the year of 2012, it is clear that many in the PA to structure to battle reports early rather than intended.
A survey on the other.
For the first time, voters right would prefer candidacy Francois Fillon, before the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy, 46% against 44%, according to the bva-l 'Express.
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously people from the surroundings of the Prime Minister.
"If they believe the possible defeat, would stand," tells Mr raffarin.
"will still believe that can win the," fixes Alain juppé, balanced zřejmostí.
Euro: the European Central Bank to continue in their purchases of government titles.
The last session of the Council of Governors of central in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for bringing out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of stopping a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
Crisis obliges sovereign European claims Institute for issuing securities undoubtedly will not be able to afford to be so strong under the threat of worsening of the situation now so tense in the European securities markets.
Political price would be in this case was about that higher.
Yesterday on the occasion of the press conference to pay tribute to the French Finance Minister Christine lagarde active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of a solution to the crisis of the European states.
Wouldn't say whether they thought that the Bank could do more, for example, that would increase their programme by the purchase of sovereign bonds.
"reserve to its account for my European partners,...."
Night before that, in Brussels, European Parliament during his interrogation by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs, President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, appeared as výřečnější, if it's about his intentions, and was content with the fact that the said that the purchase of the state titles on the secondary market "continues" and that "We will see how we will decide" during the meeting, which will be held this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will watch their basic constant interest rate on May 1%, its historically low level from 2009.
In fact, the bond purchases of Treasury, carried out by the Central European Bank in the last week doubled to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to the nerozumnosti dohodců on the market has made yesterday new bond purchases of Irish and Portuguese.
Overall, central banks of the Eurosystem, bought the 67 billion euros from May 2010.
Between dealers on the market, no doubt, anticipating the impacts on the continuation of the purchases do not see party 29.
Even economists do not expect no significant change of course.
If operation loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, is this the latter bank to the unlimited provision of liquid funds according to the generous conditions and the duration of one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that would change the important way its program."
"If not, it would be to accept the risk of triggering the short term new tensions," says Michael schubert, economist Commerzbank gained.
"progressive way out announced during the first quarter of 2011, it seems more likely" anticipates the Norbert bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan their intervention in the market with the public debt," the European Central Bank would have to keep the purchase of its bonds, to revive the faint market," attached Norbert bräms.
With regard to the exposure of banks to European markets, the sovereign debt in the euro area has further to the selection of nothing other than to maintain their presence on the market.
"needs at all costs to replace lack of investors in the market and to act in a way to prevent outbreaks of paid - I. from States, belonging among the most fragile," witnessed yesterday a significant bond manager.
Because if interest rates rose and, it will be the States of more trouble to reduced its debt stabilized, instead of him.
It is saving the euro for the prize.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's hrbí back
After the start of the week for Italy worrying the situation more relaxed, yesterday with the flow of obligačních interest in 10 years.
A return to the temporary peace.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for the economy of regions, said that they heard Giulia Tremonti to qualify the situation as "nerozřešitelnou" and that it expects "unpredictable" weekend, which then zúčastněny dementoval.
In any case, in Tuesday deviation from the long German interest reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of contracts on the cover to 263 points against the risk of bankruptcy swaps soared, which caused some excitement in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi observed that in Spain with the German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni letta, by itself, said that it is "too busy" "stormy development markets" and possible contagion originating from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that is as Portugal," explains Irwin stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is a lack of growth and weak fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state risk that it will not be able to meet the needs of financing.
Last Brussels were forecast for the government cold shower.
Italy's growth is expected at 1.1% in the year 2011, and from now on to 1.4% in the year of 2012, while the Senate budget, which is available to his analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission kalkuluje, public finance deficit will be even 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year, against 3.9% of the expected government, and 3.5% in the year of 2012, instead of 2.7%.
From here, the story of the new summary supplements to the draft State budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, at a rate of 7 billion euros.
"If it is necessary, will be the new strict measures have to be taken," the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is the support of international institutions.
"The foundation stones of its economy is in order and assures its calculations are correct, we reiterate that for a long time," arrigo sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Board of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short term or long term, because, despite a significant debt, 119,2% of the gross domestic product in the year 2011, ndlr, the efforts to stabilize the required in Italy is less than the efforts required from other countries" Pier Carlo padoan, chief economist of the ocde notes.
There is a question of political instability.
14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion to censure the Chamber of Deputies and then after that may start to organise the elections, with which is planned at the end of March.
Launched would be so the little suitable for the decision in the case of a severe crisis.
Europeans thought about the strengthening of the protikrizových mechanisms.
Christine lagarde it again stressed in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated on Sunday in the course of the day and night, they are obviously very sympathetic determined, committed to defend its currency and its currency zone."
Although it is all relative, yesterday, regarding the interest on the European state bonds recorded the expansion, brought water to a mill governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't even talk about the beginning of normalization.
Office for Standard & Poor's announced that could notation swarming over record of debt of Portugal, the objectives, which is the most focus various speculation.
"Because in May is the real insufficiently transparent and clear policy, specifically on the banking systems," says economists exane BNP Paribas.
More about it, that "Political Time running more slowly than the time market."
Aware of this they suspended the context and the danger, which lies, intensify it European countries discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing mechanisms of crisis.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most concerned the problem, and in a larger scale with their counterparts of the G20, is developing very well.

The first issue of the securities fesf is foreseen in the next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative told the Reuters Agency, that the United States will support any increase in funds additional direct through engagement in fmi mobilised.
Countries, of which it is in the front row, Portugal and Spain, are being prepared for the structural reforms, particularly when it comes to the labour market.
Reforms, which are attached to the strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid another way, than use Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid at all costs, that would apply for the international aid even earlier than, than apply its own budget korektivy and decide on the structural reforms necessary to once again have the permanent confidence.
Equity participants in European funds DOES NOT EXCEED talks finally on the options available to accelerate the process of normalization with sovereign bonds markets.

Metro grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Ever since, discussion of the modernisation of transport on the Ile-de-France in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly on the metro grand Paris, which has 23 billion to build the company Societe du Grand Paris.
To this development could be running, announced the subsidies in the state of 4 billion euros.
Purely in theory is that amount, which would then allow companies SGP used to contracts part of the funding of its dual resources.
Today, finally brings us to the first dodatkům.
Rectifying plant law on the finances of the year 2010, which examines the Financial Committee of National Assembly today morning, contains the mechanisms laid down to ensure these funds.
Are two: the creation of a special tax of the equipment and increase taxes from offices on Ile-de-France.
The first, tells us is in the text of the draft Law Article 15, is "in favor of public institutions Societe du Grand Paris."
It is calculated: "income from this interest is 117 million euros per year."
The second is reconstructing the rates for the office, which already exists," to be upgraded to increase returns from her and that this would affect companies by Societe du Grand Paris."
How much it would gain?
A mirage.
It is not absolute figures in the text still.
We are a long way to 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are attached to 4 billion euros of capital, which will be mobilized state subsidies, and inserted into the company Societe du Grand Paris according to the project," can we read in the explanation of the reasons.
Us in society SGP seems shocking this system.
"From the moment we create revenue, both taxes, ndlr, we can cover the study for a period of three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, he says, there."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as appropriate."
Company SGP has considered that will be assigned to up to 4 billion in the year 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, in which 4 promised billion are still an abstracted abonentům risks, that will cause a work of parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and přičinliví spy
The case Wikileaks has two meanings.
On the one hand, it is discovered an apparent scandal scandal, which seems to be the only in the face of hypocrisy, which the relations between states, the people and the press.
On the other hand, speaks about the deep changes on the international level, and anticipates the future ruled by the regression.
But let us move in order.
The first aspect WikiLeaks, it is the fact that each document established secret service, for any nation, consists exclusively of press cuts.
"The extraordinary reported the" Americans on the sexual life of Berlusconi is it, what could read for months each in any of the newspapers, all in addition to these two Berlusconi own, and the karikaturní profile kadáfího was for a long time for entertainer artist topic for the sketches.
Rule, according to which the secret documents may consist only of the reports already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a shop, which is dedicated to the ezoterické literature, you'll see that each work repeated, on the graalu, the mystery rennes-le-château, templářích or zednářích exactly what it was written in the previous works.
And not just because the author occult texts to looking for new information, doesn't even know where to find reports about nonexistent, but because those who produce the occult believes only what they already know and what confirms what had previously learned.
It is the success of the Dan Brown mechanism.
The same is true for secret documents.
Informant is lazy, and lazy, or limited spirit, chief of the secret services, and if not, it could be, as I know, an editor at the paper Libération, who asks for true only what he admits.
Information with high confidentiality of Berlusconi, which the American Embassy sent a resort, have been the same, which newsweek published a week before.
So, why is it so much fuss around revelations of these documents?
On the one hand, they say that, while what every cultured man already knows, and that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since May heads of states making phone calls or leave the plane to dinner together, lost their diplomatic representation office and, with the exception of a few small exercise in the transformovaly in intelligence.
Any observer of movies about the investigation knows very well that only from licoměrnosti it seemingly Ignoring.
However, the fact that it is repeating itself publicly, dishonours duty of hypocrisy and a bad light on the American diplomacy.
For the other classified information, the idea that Any hacker can get the most powerful country in the world is a severe blow to, not an, for the prestige of the State resort.
Scandal the victims, as well as his "executors."
But let's get from here to deep the truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell's, it was possible to hold all the power, as a Big Brother, who controlled every movement of their people.
Orvellovo prophecy Since then, what it was found by the ability to control each movement through the phone, each this transaction, navštívený hotel, used the highway and so on, became a citizen of the total victims FUNERAL WREATHS of power.
But when demonstrujeme, as it is now, that even "the tomb," with nejtajnějšími information powerful inspection report cannot resist the intervention of some a hacker, ceases to be one way and becoming the circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen - may know all the secrets of power.
How can maintain power, which already has the opportunity to hold their own secrets?
It is true that already Georg simmel said that the real secret is bezobsažné secret, and bezobsažné secrets will not be never revealed; it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi, or indeed, Merkel is mysterious, bezobsažným secret, because they were pulled from public life; but to discover, just as it did WikiLeaks that secret Hillary Clinton has been bezobsažnými secrets, means withdraw, as appropriate, him all the power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistake for Sarkozy or Merkel, but he's done by something great Obama and Clinton.
What will be the consequences of this wounds bestowed upon the powers so significant?
Online, it is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information - that would amount to its publication on a poster vylepeném on the street corner.
But also is unnecessary hope, it is quite clear that the current technologies that can be kept in secret report on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out whether and when the head of state travelled by air and joined with some of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the private and sensitive reports in the future?
Well, I know that for the moment has forecast belongs to a science fiction and so it is fantastic, but I must think of government officials, who are carrying discreetly meeting the formalities for uncontrolled routes and wear only those reports, which they know with him by heart or rather shelter scarce information in her heel shoes.
Information will be preserved in the unique copies in drawers concluded the key: All in all, an attempt to spying in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to explain that the technology is now moving sideways ahead, it means backwards.
A century after the Wireless Telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitoval Telegraph based the telephone wires.
Video, analogue to love movies scan film step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of Assembly, while now allow CD - Digital - only jump after chapters, that is, after makroporcích.
Through rychlovlaků we get from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the air travel and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
Therefore it is not extraordinary, that policy and communications technology will return to cars towed horses.
Last note.
Sometimes, press, to understand what the embassy had in secret.
Now the Embassy, which demand a confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hackla its promises of financing
One year after the Copenhagen agreement it is time to try the compliance with promises to quickly odblokovaná financing, point funding with Quick Start, fast start or premature, realized, developed countries.
And the French hacky were discovered
In Copenhagen agreement with the developed countries committed to provide 30 billion dollars in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros, it is 420 million per year.
At the start of EU cop16 pulled out big ace, to convince its partners about the viability of its commitment concerning the financing of the fast start: report specifying the action of its Member States, press conference, Grand side event, the distribution of leaflets...
Transparent operations invaluable and recognized for its real value: the advanced countries and civil society would have to do is all developed countries and civil society as well and with the same level of accuracy.
EU announces that in the year 2010 free up 2.2 billion euros, which brings it to the right way to adhere to its promise of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are much more complicated.
These funds are in Copenhagen agreement "of the new and additional," to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without it would be to the detriment of public assistance for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in what means "new and additional."
While the European Commission proposed the harmonisation block, some Member States, among others, and France, process.
Today, everyone selects the reference, which fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, to see the year 2009: international funding for the reference to preserve and she still adding 150 million to him for three years, financing of fast start.
Other countries choose similar references with annual payment terms or with the timing of the level of public assistance for development.
By contrast, France has considered that "all new projects financing" are "new and additional" by 2010.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period, or to a global level of public assistance for development d 'aide health in the development.
France in particular, the total amount of aid to the developing countries can remain constant, or even to reduce, has to keep its commitment for "new and additional financing..."
Another key element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There still there is no rule and each of you choose its own way of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that EUR 1 EUR rental equal to 1, a gift.
Obviously it is difficult to sound: trying to is not přirovnatelná.
If the use of loans can be substantiated for Some investments, which are profitable, often for the projects in more efficient technologies, is linked to the reduction of, of a foolish present one euro, which we'll get as the equivalent of one euro, which we give... should not be understood by virtue of its commitments, but as the price of the loans for věřitelskou country, i.e. the equivalent of interest rates.
But France can give only such reasons: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which makes 91,5% of the loan, 389,8 million euros and 8.5% of gifts - helped millions of euros of EU - see document to think it could verify themselves.
Is the only countries of the Union, which in the scale of using a loan.
Germany from here, killing 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, comply with their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union will give EUR 1 for in the framework of the satisfaction to its promise, France can only 10 centimes and considers the effort for a comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský piece!
For summary in its financing "fast start" France is with the dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand with the development of shares in time and on the other hand, with the real financial burden.
Although spends only helped million euros, can convince them that directs 420 million euros "new and additional" in the context of its promises.
Manipulation of Minister of Finance, because it seems that, even though it is bercy double, who was such a decision could have a negative impact, at the same time inside the EU, why would the Member States have continued in the donation, when we need only to lend? - and in negotiations, as developing countries are not quite naive...
