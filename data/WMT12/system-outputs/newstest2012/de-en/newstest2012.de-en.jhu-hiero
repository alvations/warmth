No liberating revision for turned dissident by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request, in an amendment to the Penal Code sections to those who had been sentenced on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko.
The new rules, which could pave the way for the release of the detainees had expremierministerin, refused the Members in the second reading of the application to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was in October because of the closure of a supposedly harmful treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
The sentence has not yet, is to be negotiated the appeal of convicted in court in December.
Timoshenko even described the ruling as a political revenge of the regime, and also in the West, the process raises the suspicion of bias of the Court.
The request, paragraph 365, was convicted on the basis of the expremierministerin, removed from the Penal Code, was backed by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyscher victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle, or Libyan rebellion knows about their losers.
Muammar el-qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now, there are just to define the winner.
As usual, this region victories in the elections, the only question is what Islamists - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional council known to common law of the scharīʿa, which it is now in God has some idea.
Libya would become a country without crime, one for theft hackt In short, the hands.
Women should also be thought of emancipation, quickly forget any glaubensabtrünnige executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Society from each other befehdenden United tribes in future the Koran.
In short, there will be an Order in Libya here, barely conceivable and, above all, hardly would be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively will probably not be the best fit and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.
In that sense, it is rather strange that the moslem-kämpfer of the infidels dogs could help at all.
To serve its excuse may well, only the fact that the bombing of NATO general in America, but not by any of Allah even were headed, whose ownership after each successful hits was praised.
The victor in Libya? the West is not one of them.
We took only a part of a shooting, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians entledigten in the person of the dictator would have brought a political ally, without this advantage.
After the fresh, and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the local Los - a concern the expulsion of the crusaders.
The mineralölunternehmen but without occupation of the black gold to get spottpreis?
Hardly, and so the West can finally boast to right his altruism in the protection of human rights.
If you do not spoil the scharīʿa-vertreter.

The menu of fettsüchtigen child: it does not frühstückt and eat for dinner sausage
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 per cent of all pupils and 5% of children are overweight.
Current polls proved - Obese children often come from families with a ungesundem lifestyle.
It is once again, how important it is for the healthy development of a people is the environment in which he reared and examples that surrounded him.
On the tables adipöser children are cooked meats up to half more on the table than children live in families in which normalgewichtige.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the previous day aufklärungsaktion under the motto "obesity is no coincidence" chips for dinner.
In families with dickerchen also sport is not exactly one of the lieblingsbeschäftigungen, however, with the majority of today's pupils - only 15 per cent said that their parents are less time for active movement once in the week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place towards the end of the schuljahrs last year, were interviewed nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action, "Obesity is not a coincidence," Unilever supports the general insurance company and the society.
Took part in the project so far more than 12 thousand pupils from 4 and 8 classes part.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family, which are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible.
"Only half of the respondents children led to five times a day, for example, of the modus frühstück-zweites main frühstück-mittagessen-vesper-abendbrot eat - one of the conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the polls.
No breakfast and sausages to for dinner
Experts point out that relative things, such as the regular frühstückszeit of family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic frühstücken but only 23% of the families of the students.
And, in most families frühstückt each on its own.
The worst was the fact that in every tenth family is not gefrühstückt.
The breakfast is a cornerstone of the healthy daily diet.
The umfragetest, among other things, on the day that the families of overweight children consumed far more unhealthy chips.
And nearly all - without regard to weight drink every day - 70% - sweet soft drinks
Although only drive more than 40 per cent of the respondents children sport, but less than half of their parents do so - only 15%.
Stell you run your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed it to selected children of 204 172 girls and boys from 13 schools, from opportunities offered to appetite and view their own menu together.
"What prefer Czech children between 12 and 15, in terms of food, is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many mehlspeisen, fleischgerichte cards and, of course, süßspeisen.
'alarming' is the great popularity of sweet water soft drinks, the final report on the survey said.
At lunch, the main course, pasta just before poultry.
Legumes disliked the children almost nothing and the popularity of fish and gemüsegerichten as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr on health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if they get proper information.
"at the controls of the umfragebeteiligten, the ladies and gentlemen present the questionnaire after the informative address" Obesity is not a coincidence, "ausfüllten, in many cases was a significant shift in the preferences to principles of healthy diet led to record" is in the results of the project.
Was evident in the case of the sweet water limos, where many children began to give priority to the ordinary water.
The children kreuzten in questionnaire far more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less knödel or sweet foods.
Experts say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the initial article about how stylisten learning, I had a bit of a gemeckert, that was a bit too much material for the start.
As ahnte I do not in the least, and more.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the "runs on the square."
It is even worse.
The closer the review is to stand as more information and practical challenges before us.
But even if the course every samstags and Sunday takes place, it is fully documented.
This time, we debated with Director Alena as part of the course is not a single man, as it attracts a woman, who has not ideal proportionierte figure.
And there are still the most of us.
Those who have a short neck, the other a to jungenhafte figure without proper graphs and others are mollig.
It is the stylisten to conceal broad shoulders look to extend the neck or the necessary graphs hervorzuzaubern.
We also got tips on how to frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great busen, a hip and narrow their function and attracts figurbetont, without being too provocative acts.
If, for example, the difference between their and hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers really not fit, should be at least a little after level schneidern.
You will not regret it, because good sedentary clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailored skirt you feel much better, than in a book, The endlessly highs and verrutscht, in their absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can in turn allow clothing with wrinkles up applications, stickereien or raffung.
In this lot of information and I am glad that I have a whole week figurtypen time to go through the head, I have everything thoroughly.
And yet, I fear that in the face of the piece of aufgetragenen homework is almost impossible to achieve.
Each of the kursteilnehmerinnen, namely a promi allocated for you to devise suitable outfits - tagesbekleidung and abendrobe.
We should the current appearance, the modestil of its stars and take its figurtyp.
I should attract Miranda Kerr ,"" which you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, because it is much better for me personally, I juble than, for example Britney Spears or attract Christina Aguilera, has increased in the last time in the hundred kilograms of - well, that is a bit excessive, or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes should we look for magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, ausdrucken and then grafisch work.
In "moodboard," then how all this result is called, is our personal style and expressing our relationship to the grafischen design.
It is also very important to reflect on the graphic side of the stylings.
The models of the stylist is not simply physically, but also known as the produktseite in the journals - made for specific target, for example, trend-handtaschen, coats, etc.
It told the stylist and designer Mario kameník.
But the only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall picture.
The information on figurentypen angefüllte seasoned samstagsvortrag was right from three visitors from the industry:
The stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designers Jakub polanka and the modefotograf Ben renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And eingeschickter stylist can work with a single bekleidungsstück in very different ways.
The game is variabilität.
For example, can be a trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, such as a t-shirt or cloak, but it can also be on the naked body, absatzschuhe attract, and bear it as a dress.
It goes up or the Kragen hochzukrempeln and immediately, the whole look is very different.
"Is this," he said.
But I came the following Council wants most: "First of all, you know the rules perfect."
"Only then must you violate," Jakub said.
Finally clear to me why we all these lehrsätze pauken, which can be combined with What and Why, even if you get in modejournalen often quite another to see.
Not to mention modeschauen.
Thanks to the photographer Ben now, I know that needs to have a much more bekleidungsvarianten prepared stylist when he eventually photographed.
So you have for a fashion story of ten pages - i.e. ten outfits - be prepared to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothes in the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all of this we must count on the shape of the outfits.
That image and styl sometimes represent half of the success, It also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You only need to be a time to Madonna, a not particularly brilliant sängerin to from the image and marketing have made a weltstar.
In the Czech Republic are more reserved for the services of a stylisten.
Also known personalities often keep this for rausgeworfenes money - the main thing is that I am something, as I say is secondary.
And if some of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she us great chance of forcing a quite different in smaller size than he or she really needs.
Then you need googlen then only to establish with certainty that the popular press writes that the promi back to or have decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario laid on Sunday to leave us, not to believe that a stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the outfit "zusammenzubauen needs."
In his work he must, above all, which he stylt and communicate with the people he must be a clever psychologist.
People, without anzubiedern and to assess its opinion.
"If any of us a director appointed to look to their kleiderschrank and to complement fine pieces, then we can not eliminate the entire storage cupboard and said, my God, this is terrible."
"We need to find at least a couple of good things to which it recommends, what you can carry," says Mario.
It also showed us specifically, which must include a "platztasche."
So a bag to be their zuknöpft and we all need to proprietäten carries.
No clear things such as gap, abroller to haareentfernen or sicherheitsnadeln contains, they also utensilien, such as a nylonfaden - it helps the stylist, when photography products such as handbags or from Guard, Special clips, with those behind the clothes gerafft, if it is too big - stecknadeln or other klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken and, of course, nähzeug.
If, however, we must not only listen, but can also try something practically, we learned how to unterklebt shoes right.
And the Atelier photography, where the floor is, you can damage the schuhsohle, let alone the outside.
O klebten US and klebten we...
Shoes with the gap, we can not even touch so that they are not damaged.
So you have really good approach.
Mario was praised me to my "Creation" without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not just my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we got in the second wochenend-fortsetzungskurs to hear.
One thing is now clear to me - dedicating themselves to styling at professional level, is not easy.
V need for steroids: "The run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The original reckless journey through a series of completely preventable, dilettantischer failures to routinefahrt frühschicht.
Managed to fulfil the ambitions, in large part, but what use is that, if was obviously no one wants to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the ladentische, inspired the new part, with the subtitle "The run 'high expectations.
He promised, however, the bejahrte spieleserie "need for steroids" Back to postpone a step into a new dimension and the spielbaren really demonstrationsbeispielen, he seemed to be not only one of many action-rennspielen.
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the hauptprotagonist be rising out of the car and on foot to continue.
But in the end as it is already used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
Sure - potentially quite decent arkade-rennen but overall will detract from some unnecessary errors in the game of this series are present more or less for a couple of years.
So it is not really a mistake but more signs of incomprehensible laziness of the spieleentwickler in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
Once the story will be introduced, whose hauptfigur Jack has some problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, it is the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
The idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and in more than 50 individual race.
This means that every race will be fought on other route and the various stages in different is sufficiently different and interesting environment to take place.
At no time was the impression that game would always offer the same again.
Some areas are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of grafik not beyond the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing weltbewegendes.
But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Sometimes atypical elements of a little change in the individual race.
IN THE DESERT, for example, we will be surprised by a desert storm, which seriously limits point of view.
In the mountains, in turn, has to be extremely careful that it is not of a landslide buried.
Incidentally, are fairly well built on the individual race.
While only a few, but they are.
A while so people are trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents, in principle, a classic race, you have time to catch up - classic race against the stoppuhr, then expected a a personal match with a single opponent.
And this is also the police, which have the whole thing to blow.
A novelty passages, which Jack out of the car.
It is more about certain interactive animationen, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players away to the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as we would expect, specifically only three.
Ultimately, this is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above one of the elements that make the game abwechslungsreicher.
The fahrmodell is in the previous fußtapfen parts.
This means that from today's point, it is not seen Trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it would be bad.
Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But a aktionsgeladenen rennfahren the European fahrmodell will also continue to do quite well, even though the competition could find better.
Until then, has everything so well.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
In contrast to the fahrmodell is kollisionsmodell does not quite OK
A game of this nature is hardly calculated to expect it complicated deformationen and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea, how the car is, it is clearly not everything is in order.
Typical example: the close or vorbeifahren to overtake oncoming cars "touches" only slightly, try the other in places in other, almost identical situation but it comes into slings and is wild pirouetten.
Or the karre is equal to scrap.
Thanks to the restart-systems makes it no more, annoying is it anyway.
The restarts are resolved, when you have destroyed or remote ends up the route, it raises the game back to the last indication of the route.
It has only five restarts only in each race.
If they have exhausted, Everything is from the lot.
The restarts are something like rather a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but it is hard to leave it.
Sometimes does not help time restart, it is nothing less than the critical section to learn from the head.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some trends must be crossed in a very specific way, for example, otherwise you simply does not.
Elsewhere, met in the appropriate place "civilian" cars is in the same configuration, irrespective of whether the first or fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is annoying, especially in situations when you see that the kontrahent a easily two oncoming cars until you even get away, but there is, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or brakes.
And it does n't matter when it comes, everything is designed so that such a situation is always close to their nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where we are being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again, regardless of the time.
The verrücktesten is the conclusion of the game in the long bridge, the head happens.
The kontrahent must overtake here, obviously, on devil come out.
And if it is already time A, then of course it makes a point of view, so they drive their own car a couple of times in Klump initially.
Clear - they want the game simply exciting and are more exciting but the intention is clear, they quickly the joy of the game vermiest.
Be sold and that is a shame because, despite a simpler fahrmodell entertaining and some aktionsgeladen, overall the game is right that there is almost no longer know, where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what "blame" - the concept of 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that can not raise boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is the wagenwechsel during the race.
We should not overlook the stations on the road, because you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that they are.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousinen to draft the motorways and exotic super-sportwagen for the technical operations, for example, on the serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the modus spielgeschichte is also the aufgaben-modus challenges - so the race in each of the lokalitäten, which we know from history.
There is not only to win medals, but also erfahrungspunkte for its profile, which together for the tasks of challenges and history.
To get to higher fahrerniveau, have various items: the car started to be open to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time as the online-funktion autolog to which, among other things, its own results achieved compared with those of other players and also provides for more collective functions.
One of more incomprehensible schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here we come: with the car in a u-bahn-tunnel - nay, where one in the dark on the long RAST seemed as well.
Look at the tacho paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h - nay, but that is at once to scrap from behind a subway and drives a uncompromising.
In our editors we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of the spielgestalter or whether the authors for blöd.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall in the majority of cases are agreeable and even brilliant here and there.
Even more galling is that some of bildwiederholfrequenz slows exciting times, and sometimes quite dramatic.
The concerns, however, especially the greater number of accidents involved, where a steady FPS nothing good.
The tonwiedergabe is as far as OK and the soundtrack geschmackssache.
In an effort to raise a rather young audience as broad as possible scale, created a soundtrack a lá "of any" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall need for steroids: the run? the feelings are more mixed.
If the game would not detract from the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors, we have with the brustton convinced able to claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But in fact, the game somehow unfertig.
To a class of pleasure, but you should be prepared that these errors with the power of flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye.

Eu-botschafterin vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt pulling out of the '.
I did not expect to have such a hard war entbrennt. "
"It will take five to six years, until the dust settling and all will be accustomed to her new role," began Milena vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, strongly their presentation to the law faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "understandable and openly about Europe," Ladies and gentlemen, was already in the first part of their address, in which it gained the institutions of the EU and its relationship to such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some Lektor the Law Faculty of the karlsuniversität should therefore have beneiden.
Mrs vicenová, also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism that he is too smoothly - a grey official, was no match for such a role, but I have to say that it has all the breath up how well he has adopted the cause.
"He is a man, it is ready to listen patiently to 27 Member States to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then said in response to the question: who is the actual - the European Union should? what number I call? ', that is to say, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the policy on States, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our ölmützer quargel
Mrs vicenová devoted the agenda, according to which the European Union intends to lives lived, and lives in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the presidency, describing it as a major negativum, which have severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech currently has its hands full representation in the EU.
In the words of the Ambassador said, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome, quite lively.
And there is still the EU's sieben-jahres-budget are approved, what makes it precisely because of the present economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a schlankes and thrifty budget which industries will be given, which countries more and less support - all of that is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
"If I do not like something, it is gräuliche acronym, fremdwörter and jargon that no one understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really krumme or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels invented just now or whether anyone actually want to ban the quargel us.
They used the soil of the EU also would like to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of the prospect of two or different speeds
According to the eu-botschafterin the Czechs in the Eurosceptics, the more the negative reputation, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter.
Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivierungsbriefe and, last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, the Force's and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, of V4 shows.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian to me and is a slowake in the vicinity, then does the Frenchman beside me:" Hey, what is your view the heads together - this is your V4 again? 'and it makes a pretty acid look.
According to Mrs vicenové expect the EU particularly tough rules for the budget-politik of Member States in the future.
A lot of real as a "European Federation" is the concept of a Europe of the two, or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We already have the Schengen area and we have to institute a bestärkten cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, want it, and those who do not want to calm Stand aside."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately amounts to a" strong "Europe of the various speeds," Mrs vicenová expected.
In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed by all Member States, and not just by the countries of the euro zone.
Fire story:
IBM's innovator is the second century of his existence
They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM characterized most closely, then this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public is IBM, a synonym for technological revolution, we know it as a modern businesses, though a century has passed since its inception.
The basis of this longevity, already submitted its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he was of the slogan that countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" has been a hallmark, playing for the life of the future giants should - and at the same Time magazine to the title of the firmeninternen, IBM already began in years 1935 issue.
This was also the basis of the watsen thoroughly prepared culture.
"For us from IBM means this long term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM, survived and was also a whole century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not be zurückschreckte, anything to change it.
That allowed us during our first century, the technology to transform the business and of the society.
We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today.
Well thought out system
Watson operation in the 1930s, social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the ibm-leute had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance by entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms as arbeitsbekleidung and a well thought out entlohnungssystem for best innovators and traders.
As more sophisticated, IBM's long term relationship with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the start in the talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM, choose any subject - and was accordingly.
In line with this antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year by a woman abgewechselt - Virginia rometty.
The IBM is 30 years in it, so far, the position of the vetriebs-, marketing and strategiechefin.
IBM power in the last few years' online-brainstormings, come from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas, there is enough in the company is employing almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in business the company guaranteed a strong image and both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution that, rather than a mere technologie-unternehmens," said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, rosabeth moss kanter.
"IBM is not a technologie-unternehmen, but a firm that helps solve the geschäftsprobleme by technology," added George colony of consulting-firma Forrester research added.
As the company itself points out, it does make a difference, only to be present on the market or forms by This presence directly to him.
IBM - in the states of their logo because family called "Big Blue," is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown.
It is one of the vielseitigsten IBM hardware and software, developed infrastructure, technologie-unternehmen any hosting and konsultationsleistungen in an incredible produktbreite - of servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technologie-unternehmen, IBM has the most patents and five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
To its most famous inventions include, for example, bankautomaten, credit cards, finanzswap bar code or the diskette.
With about $220 billion stock exchange value - market capitalization - IBM this year was the second largest technologie-unternehmen - immediately after Apple, Microsoft outdated and it for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate example of the attempt with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online-service prodigy or computer IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on advances achieved, that is to say, we should not emotionell tie to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem, his ground to build - and if they do not work on various platforms, leaving it.
In contrast to counterpart to Microsoft, which in principle with its operating system, Windows and falls.
Promising technologies
Participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest level of services, software and hardware participate on each one fifth.
It was 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most represented.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets to the value of $15 billion, at the same time it invested $58 billion purchase of promising technologies.
In this investionen continued IBM after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world.
Here, too, IBM was loyal to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression increased its investitionsumfang.
So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of the ibm-aktien rose raketenartig by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's profit grows kontinuell.
The unternehmensslogan of IBM is: Not everything can change - just the values.
Also can be expected to meistert this flexible giant the next crisis.
Ibm-geschichte, from käseschneider to weltallflügen
The Society IBM established 100 years ago in New York - International Business Machines initially had a rather complicated names - computing tabulating recording Corporation.
The name IBM took until 1924 - originally was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundations for subsequent society, IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history of the 19th century until the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous stechkartenuhren on the registration of arbeitsbeginns and -endes.
The architects of this new company, Charles ranlett Flint, who had until 1930 also holds the presidency of the board.
And it was Flint, the head of the konkurrenzfirma Thomas J. Watson hit, so that helped him the leadership of the company.
This leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas until now the company's unbesiegbare culture and identity.
Watson led the Company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name reveals, with the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - wurst-und käseschneidern, to spending.
In the first four decades in which Watson the firm, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company expandierte after all continents.
Watson was indispensable to the company so that it all sat in the chefsessel for 40 years, only then, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson younger.
IBM under whose leadership began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped IBM technicians and computers from NASA to Direct flights into space - the Merkur and Saturn devouring and back in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM, back in 1964, the first rechnerfamilie with equal rechnerarchitektur - the number of IBM System / 360.
A classic PC, the computer-standard the time certain, came on the market in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150.
Twenty years later veräußerte IBM his rechnerproduktion on Lenovo Chinese society, on the other hand, they bought the company's konsultantenteil PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose now fully consultingleistungen and services with high added value in the business.
The strategy, which IBM paying off in the last three years is the concept of "smarter planet."
It is the intention of technologies used in a wise way has not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in the transport and städteverwaltung.
IBM recently led the 'smarter commerce platform in trade, "to help the dealers, to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
IBM already 1932 founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - than anything erstem country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM is ČR, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in brünn.
The key for Central and Eastern Europe siedelt in Prague, and here is a world class top-forscherteam with that deals with stimmerkennung technology.
Darina rychtářová on their untreuen gatten:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep you, I do not want more.
Darina rychtářová - 53 - says - enough is enough!
After her husband Joseph rychtář - 53 - the protectors of Iveta Bartošová - 45 - had become the globetrotting, remained Darina still hope that Joseph from his rosaroten dream, and home.
But it is now final with the patience over, and for the other life, it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner, said that rychtářová.
As Darina rychtářová of the sängerin I. Bartošová had offered refuge in their own house, she would not even, in the dream, like her husband's proceeds.
As Iveta push for their education and back again after 30 days after říčany withdrew, Joseph was with them.
Indeed it known publicly that they love it.
Resigned Darina over time, so it seemed, as if they were back to reconcile with her untreuen man - now but it gave him final can not.
It is rychytář regardless, with whom his wife sleep
If rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave but in future, then he will certainly not open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to adopt his days in our common home, then I will not hinausjagen him."
"Not as a beloved, however, verirrter old donkey, but as a person, to which I have some ties have betrayed," Mrs rychtářová; they also said, however, they have already emotionell separated themselves from him and was alone on a reciprocal respectability.
The fact that he has Darina the back door verriegelt, Joseph has so far with dignity.
"My wife, I respect the decision."
"I am together with Iveta changed nothing."
"My wife wants a papier-ehe and I respect that."
"The company is ongoing, I assure you for the repairs, the garden, the piece, I do the shopping."
"With Darina maintains I am quite normal, we share not only the bed," said J. rychtář as the story blesk.
If Darina to seek a new love, then he would not stop.
"We do not sleep together, so I regardless of whether she has a friend or who it is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I have in Iveta falls in love and so I accept any responsibility.
The worst female untugenden: What's with you?
If you ask the men to mention some of typical female untugenden, then shake them all some breaking up.
Love women, see you in the following lines once again that we are a couple of unsitten reflect, the men's blood in the adern let Wallen?
Einkaufssucht
Raises their gatte, einkaufssüchtig?
They must buy at least one Hader weekly?
Do you like to buy and must be in action just a bit more?
Then it would really be a weakness in their case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their einkaufslust reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, that Mrs believes it has been, sitting on the search for a good oberbekleidung only through a kleidergeschäft bummeln and did not include all - in all kinds of farbkombinationen try in the booth?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for the majority of women, it is often the pure hell for the men.
Just think how often you have already said her husband - you time to stick out...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too fat?"
"I would take at least five kilos - should I start to joggen or gymnastik?"
"I gefalle you at all?"
Sounds familiar?
Yes?
Then I think they belong to the women who are downright obsessed about what they look like.
The long does not mean that you should go, but many men allergic reaction to constantly if your wife about their appearance whinges.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, fliesen and dust, a sweep that will scheuern - at least twice a week.
About their partner because he again with dirty shoes on the clean fliesen trampelt chastise the children, because the gescheuerte in waschbecken once again bad way and is once again, because the glastür on wohnzimmerschrank fingerprints, although the polieren such trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of 'devianz', then you should know that we should not exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life not in the first place.
Ultimately, this excessive reinheitsfimmel can harm the mutual relations and, above all, the calm in the family.
Sticheln
'dirty turnhosen come in the wäschekorb. "
"You want the old socks really attract again tomorrow?"
"Not simply took a watery in raises on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, they should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme.
Clearly, this is not bad, they only want but said that the everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not need so much to meckern.
Gossip and tratsch
Some women and tratschen clap like, as will behind the backs of getuschelt or even slander or you forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relations, so they hecheln like issues, such as, for example - who, where, when and with whom, how and why.
Women every one of us has a bit of harmless gossip and tratsch in camp.
Hand on heart, which is all women board.
But that is not to be confused with klatschtanten gross calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, are all in their area, scorn and especially for frauenkollektive pose a significant danger.

The eishockeystürmer Mr Jágr had at the montagsspiel NHL with two assistenzen large share of the 5:3-sieg of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and it is once again produktivster Czech players in the NHL.

A bit later, also was the second hits, "Czech track."
Voráček won behind the door of the hurricanes puck and presented it between the circles to the successful maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third of the heimspieler Patrick Dwyer achieved a abpfiff short-hander, but the second third was the flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hits, then drew Wayne Simmonds whose shot for the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I do not want to say that he is the best players in the league, but certainly he is one of the best three" paid tribute to Jágr its center.
"I would not learned that in life to end my career with a eishockeyspieler together games such as" with him.
"I am pleased about this huge."
"I edge I my game on."
"All those years in the NHL, my players on me and now turns the tables on their game," schmunzelte Jágr.
Carolina made game or the drama - through the hits of tuoma ruutua and the Dwyer, once again, comes from a strafschuss to establish, it was close to a goal.
Little read prevented any further complication, however, in which he was successful in majority two against one.
"Excellent pronger acted in our area."
"He got off to the puck experimented with, I took journey and Mr read, to more distant pfosten."
"I tried to meet him and I am glad that it worked," voráček described the last hits of the game from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against the Czech abwehrspieler of Montreal buffalo and departed in the second half due to a violation of the oberkörper.
The candiens büßten alongside their know Beck their leadership unverloren the penalty-schießen 2:3.
One of the strafschüsse Tomáš plekanec could not turn.
More than the money bets lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team all the high krankheitsbedingte loss on the defensive - they played only five abwehrspielern to end the game.
"This is bad."
"The game we played only to end with a single experienced players, the rest were young players."
"But because there is nothing, we have to be ready," said Jacques Martin.
"In any change a surge of attacks to rival after another and we had nothing."
"We would make the game easier and puck from our third rausbringen must."
There was still room for improvement, "said P. K. subban, one of the abwehrspieler.
The Czech torhüter Ondřej pavelec objected 30 shots from Tampa Bay and contributed greatly to the 5:2-sieg on Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets to a series of five defeats concluded, had five different protect share.
Development of the reisepreise since 1989
Until 1989, there was only five approved of the čssr state agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist.
The travel agents at all, only sold in the Socialist ostblockländer, in the West were then select.
And Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, the Soviet Union - Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea, the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary in the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then a pro-Western course, Yugoslavia and therefore have severely restricted the travel to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of socialist times, it was that there are not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc, as well as the tschechoslowaken was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the čssr individual wanted to travel to Poland, or even in the Soviet Union, then took it to the einladungsbrief, otherwise individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, travel agents also offered huge queues in the West, but then we had to accept or even before the schlafsack agent stay, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
Also the matter was far from over.
The of devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the West - were given only "politically reliable" People travel - the others were not.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not free umtauschbare currency, without devisenzusage, it would have been impossible, the necessary funds find in Western currency for a trip to the West.
The weither most Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder, therefore, that the Czechs countless wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that still continues.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989, following a reiserevolution Czechs in the foot.
During a holiday in the GDR or until 1989 in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year were 4.5 million of its auslandsferien in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, one that we no longer aware today is the fact that the currently popular urlaubsland of Czechs - Croatia could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the start of the 1990s, of the last century was the devisenpflicht lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which is a huge wave after wave of kurzbesuchen especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany stir.
The tschechoslowaken long time of travel in the West simply could not enough was there, everyone wanted to get at least a couple of days.
So schliefen Czech tourists travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a canned beer, and dauerwurst, etc. vollgepackter kofferraum.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades, our tourists the Western currency was finally free shopping.
Our level, thereby also durchschnittsgehälter surged into another important moment einmündete in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agents began after 1997 prepare regularly travels through charters, which travel thanks to negotiate the possibility of mengenrabatte, incredibly cheap compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, made the travel more easily.
To another interesting moment in the history of the "post-samtenen 'travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand - have been the first direct charter in an exotic country dealt to Thailand.
Since then fly direct charter-flugzeuge with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries every year; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
In the 100 TSD, Czechs travel every year in exotic places.
Another important moment in the era of our development marked "post-revolutionary," came in 2008.
 On 17 November 2008, the United States visas for Czech tourists, which is einreihte definitely our country under the advanced countries in the world.
The Czechs spent in 2008 for the first time more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in their history they gave to a single urlaubsaufenthalt, including the cost of per capita CZK resort more than 15 TSD..
The General Meeting is to find a new chairman, again there is a stalemate.
The Czech Football has no chairman for almost five months and there is the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech fußballverbands - fačr - not even after the Extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known.
There is still no agreement, after what election rules should be elected.
And without this No vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three players would manage the Czech football - Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomáš paclík.
In June, Hašek back from his post, where he had his colleagues in the departure of calling to some and a strong personality, could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old disputes between the two verbandskammern again, which can not agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.
The delegates were quite free to volkshaus general meeting in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial produced no result and it was not just about the election itself.
Indeed, one could not even agree on who the vollsammlung is entitled to vote - only the satzungsmäßigen representatives or equipped with an authority officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and right contributed, whose opinion after a representation to vollmachtbasis is not admissible.
The disputes in order to take the election rules, however, remains.
Also the executive did not have more clarity on the matter at its meetings - regardless of whether ordinary and extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a couple of times - the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how can we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The bone of contention is the question of whether it should approach in line with the Statute, or whether a very different model needs to be found," said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the fačr, in the management of the profi-fußball represents.
According to satzungsmäßigem model Triumphs in the third round of the candidate, the greater prozentuelle standing support in the Chamber, for which he received.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher stimmenanzahl receives from both chambers.
The Czech side again, on the condition that the winner of this prozentuellen election receives at least a two to one vote.
"Then the two vorrunden make no sense, this modus would call into question the entire zweikammerkonzept," Svoboda understands the objections of the mährischen side, it would be best, not hinzubiegen, but under current statute to choose the election rules.
Surprisingly, Tomáš paclík agrees with this, even if it emerges that the institution most probably pelta against election rules of all candidates.
"It is my wish that largely elected by the statute."
"Not unreasonable ersatzvarianten thought out, as in the past," said the owner of the fußballklubs Victoria General Meeting Plzeň, standing for the first time in his opinions and, above all pelta to abgrenzte.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
His opinion, known in Nymburk the new chairman and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"The time possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly lead to calm the minds."
"If the football only on the euphoric wave is, it is the willingness to cooperate more," says the official Jablonec, all three adepten the greatest experience in both professional and regional level.
Rajchl as cautious.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes" officialdom. "
"A new block at the General Meeting is therefore not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," said rajchl finally.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is no longer.
Some negotiations should supposedly directly experienced in Montenegro, but who knows whether the fußballgeneralität until qualification game will actually be completely.
The charterflugzeug, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and rajchl should fly to podgorice, in Prague on tomorrow because of a technical disorder could not launch and we sought urgently for a ersatzvariante, as there is a part of the Executive Committee but to the site of the barrage-hinspiels.
Ultimately, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and physical education would have divided parties within the country's largest sportverbands moved to an agreement.
So there is a lot at stake: state benefits, vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the čstv, the Czech sport after the financial problems of SAZKA the new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
If Tomáš paclík, the head of the pilsner footballers of the Extraordinary General Meeting to have a strong candidates can represent all of his ideas on the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands - fačr had met, if he had not signed up to the fight for this position at all.
"If there is a good candidate, I would fight for him and to renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not such a adepten to find," said paclík ČTK.
The main reason for paclík to match with Miroslav pelta and Jindřich rajchl to go, it is to ensure that the supposed favorites of the election, pelta, at the top of the fačr anyway.
Paclík also emphasised that, in the event of his victory intends to exercise the role of chairman only a year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
Seen in the position of the President he would like to know top-manager, which is not involved in the fußballgeschehen too much.
"with some people in question, I personally have spoken."
"Hard to believe that some said to me that you were currently not identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would like changed," he led.
Most of all paclík allegedly disrupting the pelta's links with the chairman of the pilsner bezirksfußballverbands novel berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, and with the ability to influence delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings will.
It is for this reason for paclík unacceptable that pelta had held the position of the chairman.
"in his victory would einkonserviert and today's situation in the Czech football is not making any progress at all."
"The support of berbr, a cleverem businessman, football would badly," said paclík twice.
Here it is also important that pelta's name in connection with telephone to identify some time ago in a korruptionsaffaire fell, however, the pelta go unpunished emerged.
"I do not know what kind of prestige a victory of pelta - tsch. - Football should get involved."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl paclík, his former saying, "He will Pilsner sell fußballklub if pelta Chairman will" see, but something about.
Paclík, should the donnerstagwahl victories, he could present a future cooperation with pelta well, however.
As another candidate - rajchl, thinks the paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"he - pelta - would be the first, I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him a good example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I if my nose resides not in matters that I do not understand," said paclík, so providing for attention in September that he was behind the recall of the schiedsrichterkommission with luďěk macela replaced at the top level, the Dagmar damková.
Paclík even claimed that he felt the role of the verbandsvorsitzenden increased.
And refers to his skills in the leadership of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with his support in May the first celebrated triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the fußballmilieu and contribute to a certain degree of cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disziplinar- and berufungskommissionen, which led to degenerate into horrific situations," paclík, no secret of his antipathy towards the sparta-chef Daniel Křetínský power, for example.
As one of its priorities, would be the strengthening of relations between the fačr and the Czech olympia-komitee, with whose help he would lobbyieren that the political leaders for more money from the lotteriesteuer goes into the sport.
"This is one of the key issues that should be addressed the new chairman."
"When it comes to taxation of glückspielen declare, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but then they must also state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík is also not a handicap to his link to the pilsner club, even though he stresses that the Chairman of the fačr must be "non-partisan."
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It makes sense, in my opinion, but not much my shares in the club of Pilsner hypocritical to a transfer of drittperson after 18 months back again," said the paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the fačr, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the fußballverbands promised one of the candidates for the vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav pelta, it will get in the case of his election campaign for the fačr gets new statutes, excluded from the dispute over the election rules in the future.
The official Jablonec is the donnerstagsverhandlung Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be defuse safe in any success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September in the event of his choice, he wanted to focus the team and the collection of funds.
He decided only at the last moment, to take part in the election before the last general meeting and liked him two months break help to defend his ideas on the running of football and present in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, They are impatient and expect, therefore, that the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the jablonecer club, but in fact many years in Sparta and the executive acted.
He also believes that it has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football do.
He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria, the days of Ivan Hašek was.
"Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June approved statutes, which were not so completely, as all had adopted.
If you had not allowed different interpretations, from September onwards we have already had a Chairman, "pelta said.
The revision of the most important document of the Residents' Association he used as a lure for the delegates.
"I should be president, then I accept its myself and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing, without which he can not be," claims pelta.
In further attempts to it does not, its opponents to define.
Earlier he had announced that it will be able to cooperate with Jindřich rajchl imagine that he recognises because his legal education and he knows well that opposition would be his first deputy.
Also Tomáš paclík grip he no longer, which in turn was no dry up pelta.
In football, it moves for over a year and can already point to some successes. "
"but its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore doubt now addressed many of his real character," pelta remain faithful to his opponents, the most proklamierungen, which he said in September.
It believes its biggest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest spielklassen, to the team.
And it should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to make all affairen to end - from the korruptionsskandals causa Bohemians, to the nachhallen of last year."
"Straight after that I would like to bring negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
Then, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football would mean no personnel cleansing.
"I would first like to familiarise themselves with the arbeitsinhalt of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where because of the long anarchy there is understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday not free travel to Nymburk.
"If really should be the only point of controversy, as it votes in the third round, then we can get over."
"Football needs credibility and makes it only by back when he finally has a new leader," pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his funktionärskarriere remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the fačr below him to work hard begins
When the deputy chairman of Jindřich rajchl at the General Meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands should be elected, that would supposedly many people in the Association of vermiesen the humour.
Rajchl promises that we begin to work hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce a system changes and the members of the executive responsible for individual fußballbereiche.
He also promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise, to continue the work that the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun.
"as President I would like to pay football as a whole.
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the nationalauswahl, professional football, to the leistungsfußball for young people. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a teamspieler and would, therefore, like to distribute the executive powers so that each Member pays a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football in each segment with meilenschritten to progress. "
Many would not just delighted about this, because it now, rather than criticise the work of others, even should start to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the fußballbewegung have considered to stand no longer.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly stick between the legs and every step I have to throw in question," he said as an explanation as to why he had hesitated.
But "a lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise it would others."
"the confidence is, we should not miss this," he said.
Allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work that he has begun between Hašek.
"We have a great deal of work completed in two years and I will now not just throw away."
"processes have been launched, have to wait for a few years to reflect and I would not see anyone stop," he said, and has now expressed his concerns, in case the other candidate - Miroslav pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach and this is not something that Mirek pelta brings."
"Stand behind him, above all people, which would make the football, that he would be there only for politicians."
It can be some blame, but not to me, I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it all goes well and not only the Select," said rajchl.
It also rejects the claim that he was a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and a mährischen part, whose winners in each of the first league aufstiegen."
"That, it might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players to play in Moravia is a problem," rajchl says.
Because now the head of the pilsner clubs Tomáš paclík has joined the fight about the role of the chairman, rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which refer to their elected deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me," led rajchl, the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unvorteilhafte treaties, the fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the agreement lotteriegesetz sees as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association is not in a single direction.
While he pelta says, "He was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help," He sees the second rivals - paclík as a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he is elected, he would probably continue the things the Ivan Hašek has launched, the staff in the commissions, he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly Not the things in its favor hinbiegen want, "Judgments rajchl on his rivals.
Europe's best pools
Jump into the blue

Planschbecken travel through Europe in ufo-optik, prunkpools in Budapest, who may be experiencing blue miracle - and, after a städtetour or migration the tired legs in sprudelbädern rested.
A book shows where promotion in water is the most beautiful.
If same meder in the past year and a half to recherchereise, one was in their luggage did not lack: their swimming suit.
The rücklings appropriate on water, they looked highly skilful was kuppeln, they swam marmor-putten to be the most beckenrand waited on you, and staunte on restaurierte meticulously jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Appealed to her bad it took flight in their notizbuch - including wissenswerten details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 pools erkundete architekturhistorikerin meder in this way - and is now in their newly published book "badefreuden": volksschwimmhallen in Munich, "hardcore-betonbauten historical badepaläste in the Black Forest," in Taunus.
By 13 countries led them their "trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Serbia and Croatia, and each city in Luxembourg.
The 46-jährige German is a real badekultur-enthusiastin.
With sport, you do not have much on guard says meder - only in the water is a different.
Angry only to accept that schwimmfans with blue kacheln and chlorgestank during jogger betörenden smell of fichtenwäldern inhalation or fröhlichem vogelgezwitscher in the park can listen.
"One day I have asked why swimming pools are always so must be ugly," says the meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect fine baths."
Wasseroberfläche doubled architecture
Geplätscher in sprungbecken and ätherische sauna-öle - the wellnessfaktor In bathrooms it was so great to be served, meder because all lines.
And if the builders of trouble, schwimmhallen can have a real augenschmaus: "rather than a fußbodens has been in bathrooms a wasseroberfläche."
"On the one hand, it is clear, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All look: a high gewölbe, bright kacheln, sprungbretter doubled.
The kleinformatige bildband "badefreuden" provides wissenswertes on 190 sides of the architektur- and cultural history of historic wellness-oasen - power but want to jump into the blue.

The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters, which is almost black, whose schlick a skin areas, when one of the basin is slipping, a wellness-erlebnis special.

Agrar-spekulation
Deutsche Bank is rohstoff-geschäft review
By Christian teevs
Is the German bank with agricultural commodities to their business?
After spiegel-online-informationen, Josef Ackermann, appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the konzernchef then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the bundesbürger the matter is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agrar-rohstoffen speculate such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents, even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of this business, because it is exacerbating the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a forsa-umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to the foodwatch in October.
It shows the author Harald Schuman, the betting on the global rohstoffbörsen push up prices - and therefore the banks bear the blame on global hunger problem.
The campaign of the body providing protection for consumers is specifically against deutsche-bank-chef Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, act similarly.
Rohstoffwetten were initially intended to secure traders against price volatility.
But now, most experts agree that the zocker of supply and demand have decoupled - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the us-konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to look into the allegations and said, "It is not a business value, the good reputation of the German Bank compromised."
According to Spiegel online an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch-report.
The review aims to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, how it should be handled.
At the end of January to the top of the bank then say what consequences it creates.
At the end of May be a reduction of rohstoffgeschäfts, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann forge on his image
Foodwatch-chef thilo bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks damage the common good today."
Ackermann as Supreme bankenlobbyist stand special duty.
"The German bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," said bode.
"regardless of whether Mr Ackermann for people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the konzernchef a few months before his departure from the office would like to make a perfect picture.
The German bank announced on Monday that will not change in the boards of the CEO different than planned.
With a retreat from the controversial agrar-spekulation could aufbessern his image.
He hardly needs to do - and possible losses it had, after all, his successor.
Every second rohstoff-anlagen would announce
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, already more than 30,000 users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday bode published the survey, for which the Institute forsa 1001 has asked people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 per cent, so it is legitimate for the Deutsche Bank facilities offering, where prices for food gewettet.
Many clients would also draw Personal consequences, when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: every second, according to the poll, would, in which money flows into the rohstoff-spekulation cancel all installations.
43 per cent would discourage known of such a bank, 49 per cent, to reflect, to terminate your account and switch to another Institute.
21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilions located
By Mrs wiensowski
A architekturgeschichte with ups, Downs and happy ending: the Austrian weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels 1958 won prices, has been to the museum in Vienna, and verkam was empty.
It is now reopened as a ausstellungshaus.
If modern nachkriegsarchitektur geschwärmt, clear forms, glass halls, courageous schwüngen and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in the technical progress, the Austrian pavilions located the architect Karl schwanzer is for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilions located, then won the Grand Prix d architecture for his easy and schwebend acting stahl-glas-konstruktion.
The construction of valid until today as a cornerstone of contemporary architecture.
He gave the architects known, that also Austria's next World Expo pavilions located built.
With his legendary bmw-vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem nebenbau in Munich, he was 1973 finally internationally renowned.
His planned as a temporary ausstellungsbau pavilions located there was established after the world in Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof converted and 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - it was called the "20s house."
The building but was neither physically and technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna was getting a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf krischanitz pavilions located rebuilt, he is now "21er House" and is used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere opened, which includes the House, the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes husslein-arco has enforced the New START, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere was in 2007.
Husslein-arco, qualified art historian with considerable career including the youth as eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, began strongly among politicians and the denkmalschützern, they acquired the restructuring and private sponsorengelder and determined the use of public resources.
Fritz wotruba except gegenwartskunst, the works of the bildhauers should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop, it should be, and a bürohaus had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was krischanitz the ideal person to work.
Not only because it Joseph olbrichs secession sensitive converted and extended in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he has studied in schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilions located "was, for him, an" incredibly important place in which he had seen "Almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the ur-entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his umnutzung generosity and easily lost.
The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: the building was "a energieschleuder," says krischanitz.
The fensterprofile outside glass were replaced, glasfaserverstärktes isolierglas used, and the glasdach replaced by special sicherheitsglas.
Kältebrücken-stahlträger are strengthened, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been repaired or replaced.
Two untergeschosse led to space for the New use, abgesenkter lichtgraben between the house and the road is belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy schwanzer-pavillon.
The original außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rostschutz-farbton removed.
And the kinosaal even very, just as it was before.
And all of which will be under strict supervision of the denkmalbehörde and with a small budget.
"A material often had to be found, it is good and is cheap and the denkmalschutzamt appealed to," says krischanitz and points to a ruppigen soil, in the untergeschoss.
Despite all the constraints, problems and restructurings, the building remained flexible and easily.
Was it difficult with the pavilions located, "the daherkam from Brussels," krischanitz has recently said that a typical "drop-in-the-city-geschichte."
This kind of architecture is "always in the wrong place," and was still "create a proper awareness."
In this case it is 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke of luck pass: around the Swiss garden is just the completely new planned "hauptbahnhofsquartier ', with offices and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21er House could increase by another krischanitz-bau, because the sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary kunsthalle bought, and we hear that they have to negotiate with the city by a garden of neighbourly location within the Swiss.
Railways plans winter-krisen-paket in millions

Deutsche Bank pays millionenstrafe in the United States
Following the uproar over head Josef Ackermann, new hardships from the United States: the German bank has to pay a millionenbuße there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the German bank, brings the industry giants, now his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million - EUR 106 million - in comparison to settle disputes because of the collapse of five large mutual banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of hypothekenpapieren.
The finanzmarktregulierer ncua raises a number of big banks, the mutual banks misled by false promises to buy financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost substantially in value during the financial crisis and tore the banks in the deep.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve this issue without the parties going to court," said a deutsche-bank-sprecher in New York.
The bank acknowledged the comparison does not blame.
This also applies to the Citigroup, the payment of $20.5 million committed.
The ncua-vorsitzende Debbie matz welcomed the concession of the two geldhäuser.
The National Credit Union Administration - ncua - is responsible for the us-genossenschaftsbanken and is, in order to protect the kundeneinlagen during busts.
To get the ncua tried to replace the billions damage caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulators also had other big banks vorgeknöpft and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, sued the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the hypothekenpapieren in question is called mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on hauskredite.
When the us-immobilienblase burst in 2007, it was a wide range of financial to blight.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, kippte investment bank Lehman Brothers.

Deutsche Bank also needs to a complaint from the fhfa, there is a business worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The authority demanded that the Frankfurt for "substantial losses" accountable, without having to give a precise figure.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as groundless and said, to want to defend.
Warren Buffett increases with IBM in a 10 billion
IBM finanzguru Buffett invests heavily into it.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always said, not to invest in it and computerunternehmen, as the term development of the companies only bad forecast leaves.
Now, however, he had read the accounts of IBM and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had much earlier must understand that IBM, above all beschaffe services anbiete and computer systems for the it-abteilungen of other companies.

Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of the "zwickauer cell," Doubt Turkish media of the German state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," the now auflebe again.
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek entrepreneurs from 2000 to 2006, legislate a far background.
On this news in Turkey, and within the deutschtürkischen people reacted with fear and concern in Germany.
In many of deutsch-türken go back for a long totgeglaubtes specter: since the were in mölln in November 1992 and solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks legislate with far background.
There are xenophobia in Germany, but was never in question.
Racist network revealed the scale, however, demonstrates their dimension is not yet known.
"Once again, the bloody ideology?" "haberturk,, the internetausgabe of the Turkish newspaper."
The newspaper "'Sabah' has" been stressed, however, that one of the perpetrators of a v-mann of the verfassungsschutzes should be and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the extreme right wing quagmire.
Calmly responded the Turkish community OF GERMANY: It was at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the deutsch-türkischen anwerbeabkommens thought.
In joyous colors had been orchestrated the together - as a story of success.
Like a slap in the face, because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the 50th 'is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform" Have X, "the background to the mordserie it referiert.
Also the "hürriyet" is not the deutschlandausgabe, this product link to draw.
"It is beginning to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid the taxes and have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical in deutschtürkischen Internet forums fahndungserfolg discussed the actions of the Police and their later.
Why it was the German authorities have not learned much more to legislate in far circles looking for suspects, surprised the authors.
One is prepared to drastic measures, at least rhetorically: "will continue to geschlampt here remains the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces."
"However, this will be the best protect."
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the network depends very much inner peace in Germany as a whole," writes "selenium."
What it means if the internal peace in Germany in danger, clarified the attacks of mölln and solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the brandruine of solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living evident that there is a tangible threat, and the German that distrust and distance can result in right violence.
The attacks schärften, however, the wir-gefühls on the Turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was, above all, the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl criticizes refused to visit the survivors of mölln.
After the attack of solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but was at his funeral in Cologne - represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Kinkel was then in his speech on how many charges provide local Turks.
Just as the value of berechne people according to the level of its very.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the suspicion of many deutschtürken in the domestic law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and reassessment of the Extreme terrorism in Germany needs this time open words.
The skandalbank of zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS during the financial crisis was almost bankrupt and slides from one crisis to the next since then.
It is now a German.
Axel Weber so it was certainly not intended.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July that he would compete 2013, almost as a spectacular new job: verwaltungsratspräsident Swiss big UBS - an unexpected and lucrative karriereschritt.
Axel Weber pleased publicly praised the Swiss whether their beauty and UBS whether their new fall solidity and has gained warm comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS, the turnaround managed."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."
But in September, it became clear that it would be completely different.
A trader of UBS in London was all security systems of the bank and around 1.7 billion euros, verzockt bypassed.
Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald raised grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.
The verwaltungsratspräsident of UBS, also wounded as - and since then all questions: When will finally Axel Weber?
Already, it became known that Weber can advise the Bank of February in 2012.
And the verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, the tough.
Instead, he is not a banker, professor and bankers and would have had a einarbeitungszeit certainly needed.
In one fell swoop, he assumes the responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has once again proved that they have long been deserves the title of "biggest skandalbank Europe."
Because the UBS is one huge - until recently, it was the world's biggest asset manager, slides and on the other by a scandal over the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is of the once proud Swiss bank?
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be a very large number in investment banking.
So the UBS managed on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion in 2007 vermögender customers more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was vorgerückt as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent longstanding bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "my students, I have the UBS then always presented a model of a good bank."
"from today's point of view, we are asking: how could I am just so wrong?"
He mistaken huge.
In 2007, for the first time was apparently substantial schieflief that something in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, chief executive Peter wuffli surprising back until that was regarded as a hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers.
A few months later, we ahnte why he was gone.
The bank's investmentsparte was faced with subprime-papieren verzockt and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulders, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of a record 13 billion francs.
This was actually investors, however, what about some have until just before the nose gerümpft: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds of Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, so was denied that they do not learned his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to provide new milliardenverluste verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel ospel, even of the next best paid board of the Swiss, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments on the brink of collapse during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a zwangswandelanleihe, on which you could be miteigentümerin of the bank.
Shocked the whole of Switzerland was dramatically - because they said, as it is for a small country, if it has large banks.
After all, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times as large as the performance of the Swiss - see grafik.
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says bankenforscher Geiger.
First on the disaster, the second.
Already a few months to surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and responded to the data on vermögender customers had hinterzogen issue, perhaps with the help of the bank tax.
They also agreed a payment of $780 million to - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and strafaufschlag.
Known for the UBS helped, more or less open to tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for rich clients: the mystique of discretion.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of chief executive and verwaltungsratspräsident.
And the exodus of kundengeldern.
So the Bank within a few months had lost its credibility in two key portfolios: by the fehlspekulationen in investment banking and asset management by the support for tax evasion.
And just as it has been somewhat calmer again, just as they thought the UBS will now get it once again, there is this unfortunate händler-geschichte: an individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something goes wrong.
And it is clearly: the risk management in the investment banking work apparently still do not.
"with the case of adoboli, we must see the risikokontrolle too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finanzprofessor on bankinstitut of the University of Zurich.
Also finanzvorstand a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS, the risikokontrolle not under control."
But it was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers have been stood for a long time, guardian of the major assets of the world: not too great a risk to security for money - was the alpenrepublik time across the world to collapse.
The tresore of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and sprüngli is especially noble chocolate.
The core of the UBS in Zurich does still fit the stereotype of the sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit more.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich bahnhofstraße, which leads from the Central Station, directly to the zürichsee by the Swiss mountains frames is true, the schneebedeckten summits.
The buildings here are magnificent, the ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere as we Tiffany's will take place between Swiss traditionsgeschäften as the Confiserie sprüngli.
Reside here for centuries the Swiss banks: the Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear.
The empfangssaal UBS is one with a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls marmorverkleidet before big ledersessel, in addition to the bank-logo a great sign for "safe."
The UBS know what the customer is here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse betrayed, but eventually ousted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank will take place.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all power, as Swiss Bankers, business with the two big banks.
The UBS has become far too big, it will also - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say there.
"And if there is, you have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, the UBS modified, only high profits and then delivering the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the subprime-dschungel as the Swiss big.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"on that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of small siebenmillionenlandes the largest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lucas hässig, in his book "The ubs-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians, to save the big facing bankruptcy.
How did this come about?
We talk with Swiss bankers, So you see the problem, particularly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks to an enormous company.
There was a bank, which is already in the merger was too big for the little Switzerland - and steadily grew.
It helped that the two different vorläufer-banken supplemented the UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank focused Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalisierten favourable investment bankers came to a lot of money that they could make a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 konzernchef of UBS, and Marcel ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that wuffli and ospel were a traumteam," bankenforscher Hans Geiger says.
"wuffli, hochintellektuelle, humble, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and ospel, the top of the bauchmensch, up from the banklehre has heraufgearbeitet."
But the closure of ospel was rely on wuffli.
And wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: embolden came before the fall.
Staff of the UBS is clearly remember the führungskräfte-meetings, on which konzernchef wuffli dethrone again and again to the same slogan: Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful Investment Bank.
They led the league with ', "the rankings, which documented the success of the banks the time.
Then, wanted to UBS, according to top.
A few steps were already have it.
In the devisengeschäft and trade in shares, she played at the very top.
Unternehmensberater which have been charged, highlighted a weakness, however: the international zinsgeschäft, in the bankersprache "fixed income," there is a huge gap to the biggest banks.
The UBS have gaps in American hypothekenprodukten.
To close this gap, travelled UBS in an adventure that you almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank and invested a gegründeter hedge funds in American subprime-anlagen ahead.
It into a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage packaged and weiterreichte - but it also risks kept.
Also, as other banks long sought the withdrawal.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS has bought there," says bankenexperte Geiger.
The euphoria so great, so deeply.
The manager had to go after the other, as did the attempts were more difficult than had been thought.
Post in the UBS became schleudersitz and are still shaky.
Who leads the big now, has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, all of the obvious abhandengekommen business models.
Bankenforscher Geiger already has an idea: End in investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank will go - yet - not quite as far.
But the investment banking will shrink sharply, this much is already clear.
Next Thursday, will present the world's new bankchef Sergio ermotti its future strategy.
Of the 51 years old italo-schweizer was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank surprisingly separated by predecessor grübel.
Now he has enforced: he is permanently the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to back the state in the 1990s.
3,500 delete it.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What will they earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber already is safe.
Publicly he says so far, with his wife but he will first seek a home in Zurich.
Next year.

Large colonies, with more than 600 brutpaaren including the Westphalian soest, in the northwest, among other things jever, diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
In 2005 had a controversial project to mass killing of krähen caused negativ-schlagzeilen in district.

The project will already adopted by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds, too, had jürgens opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: saatkrähen benefit not only tools, in order to get a biscuit, but as a tool in their tool even themselves.
Animal behaviorists of the University of Cambridge testeten on four saatkrähen recently, how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In an experiment the birds quickly learned that they have to get a structure with stones down, in order to obtain a mottenlarve.
Without much training you purposefully, realised what size and shape a stone needs to have the platform to collapse.

Peter englunds new book begins sensitive and generous "beauty and horror: a history of the First World War, told in 19 schicksalen" with a long list of players, which is to heart.
Could a tip, as we do here: Are you this side of careful and make it her lesezeichen.
They are these people in englunds romanhafter narrative, is very well know, and these players will work as their GPS, as the beacon in these few moments in which they englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he describes as "a work of the anti-geschichte" not incorrect.
It includes only a few Big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little Ambassador, reckless reporters play or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was"; it is about feelings, "impressions, experiences and emotions."
"Beauty and horror" almost the kriegserfahrungen of 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women together on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, krankenwagenfahrer and büroangestellten.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will lose to prisoners of war, gliedmaße, crazy or die.
Each of these flackert as the votivkerzen live in a church, some are added, while other lapse.
Englunds book different from the usual history books.
It should also corrected the idea of the First World War was only of the devastating stellungskrieg at the westfront.
"Beauty and horror" ends with expertenblick on other kriegsschauplätze: the Alps, the Balkans, the ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bienenkörbe fall to the soldiers in this book, a celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetsefliegen an intractable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the outset.
The lives of these people flooded the war as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, according to kordit smell.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children, and kanonenfeuer heard in the distance, you keep or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why the war is being conducted.
"The lack of the facts," Englund notes, "have been on assumptions that assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas of conspiracy theories, dream, alpträumen and rumours aufgemöbelt."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals as Florence farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard blunt, a young German schiffsmatrosen.
Their stories have already been veröffentlichtem mainly memories, letters and other material taken.
Their lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple, but they are very alive in englunds details verlierenden accumulations of small moments.
Many of them act of deprivation and behelfen.
In the history of a German schulmädchens tells it: "replacement, substitute everywhere."
"ersatzkaffee wrong aluminium, false radiergummi, papierverbände, holzknöpfe."
He tells more of the ersatzessen in Germany.
He describes "meat in gepressten rice and in hammelfett gebacken - and was last with a false bones from wood was served, tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dehydrated kartoffelschalen, shoes, with timber besohlt goods."
It was, as he noted, "837 registered nahrungsersatzmittel, which were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered kaffeeersatzmittel."
Some stories are of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges its own drive to wildheit and says: "One feels about the war, that in spite of everything that is what was planned for men rather than to sit in the lehnstuhl, with the abendblatt or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and so, as was such a facade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarity behind its own strengthened and beschlagenen hemdbrust."
Conversely, a British soldier that he probably die and nobody will notice or care.
"If the idea is to sacrifice themselves, gap, you would think that this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as horrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe fall apart, and on new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins a the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the young century": the word "streamlined and ideologically committed mass murderer in the maßanzug, slaughter, while it sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways and there are also frivoles behaviour such as heroismus.
Englund discusses the soldiers who are actively tried to becoming infected with prostitutes contract a sexually transmitted disease every year, in order to escape the frontdienst.
"The bizarre expression to the can be discovered in the trade with gonokokken-eiter, as soldiers and schmierten their genitals, bought in the hope, to hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eyes, which meant that they were blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves englunds poetry geschmeidig and unaufdringlich and fits perfectly in his human task, however.
In dozens of small scenes, he starts the way, such as the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in unique ways: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
The people are starting to ask why their leaders in the fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted as Paul fussells' Great was being solved and modern memory "or novels as Erich Maria Remarques" nothing new "as a comprehensive history books in the West.
Englunds bond is an unconventional ruhmeshalle.
His book has the most devastating end that I have ever read in a sachbuch.
I give it no longer ago.
But it is, as he would have in his book this side with the players before the nose weggeschnappt and lit with a streichholz.
After an early misstep minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing einsatzhelme.
We had opted for the night of Monday to Tuesday, because at this time, very few people in the zucotti park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed; all other initially believed that participate in an exercise.
Polish President Raymond W. Kelly was right under them, and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the last few weeks, such as the use of pfefferspray against protesters, which goes against the rules of the dezernats and a tremendous increase in the hausbesetzern public sympathy, but were not repeated.
And so the police to remove the protesters from the zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials prepared this by you saw occupations in other cities have been handled.
A katastrophenübung, with an eye to zuccotti Randalls Iceland had taken place.
Officials increased known as the chaos-schulung - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - in order to focus on lower Manhattan.
The last schulungseinheit took place montagnacht manhattan-seite on the East River.
The order came to collect in the park, "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, which deklarierung spoke as "exercise."
"The Few police were involved, which I know, did not know that it came to the zuccotti park," said someone who would like to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that the zuccotti Park were, the senior officials of the portfolio."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson, the city had learned.
On 14 October officials sought park spaces, wichen but then back came as hundreds of protestlern together, once it had received from these plans.
Officials of various police were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including einsatzkommandos from around the city - hundreds mobile, dressed officials who are normally used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that many people in the park during the day entering and leaving almost as commuters, 1 p.m. in the coming night is a good time to.
"It was appropriate to do so, if the smallest number of persons in the park found," he said.
Ambulances with jupiterlampen and lautsprechern was slipping on the departure of the pike panties and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the vicinity of the Manhattan Bridge ready.
The lamps and the previously recorded messages from the lautsprechern dröhnten, many seemed intimidate protesters.
As the public officials in their hellblauen windjacken many protesters in the park, eindrangen rafften simply their belongings and left the place together.
The police said that no tents would be handled 1:45 p.m., in order to give the protestlern time to tackle together, their homes and possessions.
Other teams of officials seen as they were in the vicinity of collected to intervene, arrests in the park should be required.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman, said that it was for their own safety.
But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent the police actions in the park to watch, and they said that the way in which the officials was very harsh.
Mr Browne said that fernsehwagen Church Street in the westseite of parks have photographs.
When the police in the west by the great confusion, kunstrasen on personal matters of the protesters, including bags and tüten with clothes, crowded, its employees of the stadtreinigung, followed the aufhoben what had been left behind.
Some of the protesters refused to go, has been towed out. pictures of even a short time later appeared on the Internet.
A hauptkern protestlern was in the vicinity of the camp in the centre of the küchenbereichs parks position.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people at the epicentre of the gangs in their poor camp together.
And two people ketteten even trees, said Mr Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden.
As Mr Kelly said, until around 3:30 p.m. No arrests were carried out in the park.
The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
To most of the arrests, there was, as he said, for "disorderly behavior and resistance against detention."
The most prominent local officials was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officials of the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski abteilungschef kriminalbeamten, was also there.
Despite his presence ', "Mr Kelly," not "THE OPERATION, as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should access, waited a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broadway between liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a straßenblock north of the parks and Pine Street, a block further south, were constructed barricades.
It could be seen as these places from the police the radius around the zuccotti park ausdehnte ever further.
Has been observed in one place, as several officials, many of them with schutzschildern people out shoots.
Around 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the parks.
At about 5 p.m. jumped south of the pine street protesters on the roof of a polizeifahrzeugs demonstrators and others left the air in the tyre of a polizeibusses.
In one place raised the amount sperrholz a piece.
At the end, a civil servant, and a hospital protesters.
Trade union which will carers because redundancies to court against the city
The Union, the hundreds of schulbetreuern, have lost their jobs, the last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of undue influence on the schools, poor students informed, were not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity to the Union, County Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig schulhelfer, betreuungskoordinatoren and other staff members, who were the lowest paid employees of the city and had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, the union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city had access to a gesundheitsfond, the working groups, had denied that the haushaltslücke should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the Council said Dennis M. Walcott, Director of the schools, last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that we have adopted in June.
A member of the Council soared back and told him that the budget would not be released spezifiziere that staff of the schulhilfe.
Officials of the Council 37 said that they have and the Ministry of Education warned a complaint, there will be a press conference on Wednesday, on the present the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will formally announced.
The complaint will cite Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as a defendant and eight redundant workers count as a plaintiff, the all black or Latin American women, as most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the Ministry of Justice, said that the city would not presenting the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a klageentwurfs before the New York Times, the Union has the number of redundancies, concentrated in the city's schools in the armenvierteln in order to support a complaint about treatment, it claims that poor schools have lost more workers, since they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there is no redundancies Staten Iceland and very few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or Tribeca, have lost 17 schulhelfer in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, 8 and 9 and 46 workers in the districts in the South Bronx were made redundant.
With the adoption of the loss of five of the eight schulhelfern, in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, "This is not a neighbourhood betuchter parents who can organise donations to compensate for cuts."
P.S.: the budget of the 36th distrikts was reduced by 3,26% this year and has lost money, as the city changed its method for the extrafinanzierung for each armenschuleneinschreibung.
The Union also complains that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo in the mistaken, which led to the dismissal of the betreuungskoordinatoren approved.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if excess' German: transfer - workers in the United States is the change of a teacher of the payroll to describe a school in a pool of available workers are paid by the corporation.
"Six betreuungskoordinatoren were sacked, not transferred," the klageentwurf says.
Mission ended, Congress prepared to communicate with regard to Libya
It finally looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington have to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
A resolution on Thursday approved the Committee on International Relations of the Senate, which the chairman, John Kerry of massachussetts along with Senator John McCain of Arizona and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut Libya reports, and for the successful rebellion and praises the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya, which started with the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the libyen-debatte.
This summer legislators of both parties and the White House squabbled over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the US military's role in the libyen-mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution that approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, the Chamber also this Bill in the Senate. überstimmte a decision to cut money for American operations in Libya.
By the us-mission went into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was angry enough, criticizing Obama's approach in the mission, but not angry enough to wegzuziehen him forever, the ground under their feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be willing to take action is now.
The resolution by the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya to their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their selbstbefreiung" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for Foreign Relations or they will divide the legislators, as the law in June has done?
The final version is on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar, Indianapolis, the spitzen-republikaner of the Committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that He so far have not yet seen the final version of the new law.
It is according to the Capitol for the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget in almost every kongresslegislaturperiode, a top priority of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the republikaners Bob goodlatte - Virginia - will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area, in time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to the changes to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments, which were presented to this Congress and cover a range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to Both the Congress and the Senate - Other differ only slightly.
Alone there are at least 15 versions of the ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen in the Senate, would control the "federal spending."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly anfänger Republicans who want to boost their CV - to about the possibility that they have such a measure "written."
The haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was approved in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the haushaltsausgleichs.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
On the budget, some members of the number of the rules, which members of Congress are able to present limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano in New York wants to lift the limit of two terms of office of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson - Illinois has proposed a number of changes, which, among other things, guaranteeing the right to a good education and healthcare.
One amendment that prohibits marriage as homosexual, is as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurrent presentation.
Some legislators allow conflicts also want the lifting of federal law, if zweidrittel States reject this.
As keen as the members suggest changes, they are incomparably faster move as in previous years.
In 111. Congress, legislators 77 such changes in vor. 110. Congress 66th
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly, more than 150 proposed changes every two years, the figures, which the senatsbibliothek available.
But they were not much better than the current.
Add the last change that is the 27th, was ratified in 1992, has already been 1789 but actually proposed to Congress.
"Taken," giffords down, but not in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man near distance during a public meeting in Tucson had fired on them, the republikanerin Gabrielle gifffords in Arizona Monday night on national television, they sang the only broadway-stück "The sun will come out tomorrow," and said that the desire to recover, is greater than the return to the Congress.
When they appeared in the abc-nachrichten "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer rank, after words and needed help.
The program showed the severity of slow recovery from the damage that shared the bullet that its skull, the left side of your brain durchbohrt and travels through their heads from start to finish, has done.
Three months ago, returned it surprising in the Congress to make triumphantly their voice in debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford was smiling, lachte and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
As Sawyer they asked how they feel, Gifford - 41 - replied: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronauts Mark Kelly, it was part of an hour of "20/20" -specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The Special pursued giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you see them in the hospital, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the nerve.
It can only raise a finger or two, if her husband encouraged.
Months later, giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists says her, they show how simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A revenue with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
Whispering giffords another word: "After a few days toast." You would like to see changed their breakfast.
Videos, which happened in the abc-show show that music played an important role in giffords' recovery: you see the congressman, together with the therapists to Cyndi laupers' girls just wanna have fun "and Tom pettys" free fallin 'is. "
With Sawyer said in the interview giffords two hours daily with therapy spends, that you can not remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he read an article in a newspaper about the attack on 12 March giffords when it was cut off and, for the first time after the six people were asked, who were killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forcibly medically treated, while he awaits his trial.
"Many people have died," giffords told Sawyer.
"tough, tough, tough."
In the course of the recovery, his wife, told Kelly Sawyer, she said: "I was taken."
"So I would say:" Gabby not beaten, you wurdest? ', "said Kelly.
You wurdest only hit.
And you will go through this and you will you recover and will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity, rather than respect
The event was a wall street-gala, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on helplessness, frustration and loss.
In a word, collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, the spendenaktion organised in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, the stabchef and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, has been observed, the role of the troops was different.
"It was introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the severity of relationship between the military and for most of the country, sometimes admiring American public opinion.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say dienstangehörige.
Increasingly, the public is acting as do the people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said brigade general Sean example MacFarland, troops in Iraq befehligte and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way support is the one to fit us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders, or not thankless task in the dispute with the public, they want to serve.
They have also realised that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam war against proposed, was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between veterans.
With his two sons, returned from fighting with the Marines, the retired Colonel mark Cancian they warned that people outside of the military world could see its service from two different perspectives.
Some would see it with a sense of awe, because they were rebels defeated and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a 'angry, violent veteran under the surface, "said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and has adopted a formal staatsposten in Washington after his return.
During his work, he said, he felt that some of the candidate subtly erfragten, whether he is in the situation immediately after his return from the fight withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If sprecht on your service, you say," Cancian said his sons the negative impressions.
The lack of ease of the American military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is singled out, only rarely as praise.
"We as a nation value military heroism no longer, as it was absolutely normal in the Second World War," said Leutnant befehligte retired General David barno, US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead focused most of the praise of the politicians and the public on the suffering of a dienstangehörigen.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, which they have endured, the number of friends that you have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military is the growing pressure on the crackdown in rape
In an important hearing will decide this week whether 28 men and women charged with nichteingreifen in a rape before the military court.
It should not come to hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldatenkollegen at night.
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego, back from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, a 12er pack to bore beer.
He asked you whether he is likely to accompany you on a drink in their rooms.
"My alarm bells," said Lyman.
But the texanerin wischte aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh, what he is 19
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut instincts."
Came a few minutes after they had gone to lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped you, it claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former militärangestellte anxiously await a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a complaint, the against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is made, the courts have allowed.
The complaint claims that gates and Rumsfeld, not against the widespread rape within the military and acted in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., included the case initially submitted 17 plaintiffs, but in the coming months to 28 increases: 25 men and three women, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by the soldatenkollegen, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or to provide an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.,
Burke says that they had the Supreme military command, because that is where the problem starts.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals that are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? the leadership."
Burke also says that it has almost 400 more survivors contacted since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: instead of All claimants, their eggs in one basket, you will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the defense ministry, led by bundesstaatsanwalt Neil macbride, has made a request to reject complaint.
The files of the Court before Newsweek with, in detail, the defense strategy to, first of all, that the military can not be prosecuted for violations by current or former soldiers, to which it has come into the armed forces.
Because of a law of the 1950 Supreme Court, known as the feres-doktrin, has the government not for injuries to the soldiers currently on active service.
"The alleged damage during the militärdienstes the plaintiff," the document states.
The Defense Ministry refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to the service in the fight, the distinction is only in name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Play both in Iraq and in Afghanistan build teams of female soldiers such increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 female soldiers such, two thirds of them died in hostilities.
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
And it is not alone in your struggle: three other complaints but their are pending.
The veterans' legal services clinic at Yale Law School preparing a case against the four main military colleges because of alleged promotion of a highly misogynistic atmosphere.
This independently to collect voluntary Vietnam Veterans of America a complaint against the military, in which one focusing on the diagnosis "personality disorder," The rape victims, so that they are released from the service to a normal procedure, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group in December lawsuit filed against the Veterans Administration - DT.: Management of veterans - in which it discriminatory practices in its dealings with leistungsansprüchen widely accused, the information to people in the service have been sexually abused.
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of Senators and representatives from both parties presented to the Congress, which will provide a number of leads.
2010, according to the sexual assault prevention and response office - DT.: Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse - of the Defence Ministry 3.158 sexual abuses reported.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and in its own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 cases, which it estimated per year.
The report, which was published in March, is also examining the strafverfolgungsraten: 2010, 20% of the cases in the military court, covered only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumen.
In lymans case reported the alleged rape of the Military Police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, it was 11 times, the details of their rape asked a number of police officers to tell doctors and befehlshabern.
She had a vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during the hearing, she was asked about the sex that you had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said as charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says.
"I thought the labor would use. I running schreiend from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric unit, and I remember that I, as I once again appeared to my commander said that the procedure was not his, that was my procedure."
Lyman has been invited to a militärpsychiater go, the end to a personality disorder diagnostizierte and dienstunfähig said.
In January 2010, you dishonourable was sacked, so that it receives no support.
Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have presented, is, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nonetheless, it says: "In my view, they should move forward."
What stands between you and a verdict, this doctrine, which is criticized, for the first time since it was called into question.
I am always a critic of the feres-doktrin.
The military is a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive, and the same deterrence, which brings with it a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against you... but it is important for you to try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, start with its hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases.
"We will continue to fight until the military in this respect there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, which always comes first.
Walls have eyes, as researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became The New Face of the extreme right in Europe, Norway Anders Behring breivik was only one of many boys, the anti-einwanderungsmeinung online programs.
On Monday, breivik, who has been committed with a gun in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, extreme groups on the part of social support networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how will they be?
This is easy - you only have to look at Facebook connect.
"We have noted that it was not difficult to come to you," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report of the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding place of personal data is enzyklopädisch, Bartlett, says that the researchers simply use the werbetool side need to define their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers have done for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of extreme right wing groups in the whole of Europe and then visierte with adds, But rather than with a new band or the adds users have a new diätprodukt verlinken, invited to a survey, in which after their education, their attitude towards violence and asked the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult only once Her Office had to leave.
"It is quite a new method of inquiry," Bartlett says.
Some of the little surprise results. online-förderer of extreme right wing groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "Those who combine their online-aktivismus with a offline-aktivismus sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain seated behind her computerbildschirmen."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook will mean a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientist will use the side to study everything from health to gesellschaftstrends as "likes, text messages and statusaktualisierungen."
With more than 800 million active users, facebooks generated the add three content per day on average, "datensupernova" forschungsboom, the number of scientific work in the name of this side of the title in the last five years has increased by almost 800%.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook is the fact that by studying this side of people, which is normally in the street with his clipboard can not achieved.
"If you tried to ask the British National Party, people earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and should never have been granted entry," Bartlett says.
"Facebook is all this way, they will go directly to you."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to see and to resolve social problems.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who vollrausch discussed on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problemtrinken than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, wohnberater, monitor the side and a students help if too many statusaktualisierungen postet.
"You can not solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dmitry Christakis, morenos ko-autor and Director of The Child Health, behavior and development at Seattle Children's Research Institute of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, which would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook and zapft constantly the data of its own people.
The datenteam the side has statistics on the beziehungsstatus and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national glücksindex produced - and first of all claims have been used, have access to the only Facebook - master of the digital freedom have long known that the side of their huge datenfundgrube for others to make research available. -
But the users of Facebook, observed that the side you know, whether you like it or not, to a friend, which is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side one's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they do not even know about?
While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, is anything goes online.
"I do not think that many people have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for you, it was only for you and your friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in a nutzerprofil and in speeches.
"What they say on Facebook and what we do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, Selwyn despite his years as a technologieforscher considers that a clipboard and a stift are still the best forschungswerkzeuge that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going into the real world and with real people," he says.
"social research must deal with the social - and plenty of social life will take place still offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Norway Anders Behring breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Norway Anders Behring breivik, the man who has been two amokläufe, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, even in his first appearance before a public court has described as a "Resistance fighters" in Oslo.
"I am a militärkommandeur in the Norwegian resistance and a tempelritter Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the Court, as they have received their mandate of organizations, supporting the hassideologien support and because multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge torkjel nesheim cut off breivik during this monologue as he "breivik, did not want to give the opportunity to take advantage of this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he breivik, the speech mitbrachte, compiled an advance permission, at the end of the hearing to address the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police breivik for 12 more weeks, he remains in custody, four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities will be closely monitoring all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were able to see, in the hope that breivik in, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All took part with the aim that everything comes down to a wegschließen.
"I thought he looks cold and inhuman," a survivor of utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster, NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it is a little Further, after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik, wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and felt throughout the hearing calmly and professionally, he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes, as he entered and left the building.
Despite breiviks bizarrem reference, it would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judges came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and he said that there is no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may, for some that the attacks on 22 July, apparently the work of an individual extremists and was not that of a group of radical.
But this automatically relieved the pain and confusion, the whole nation still feels?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do that," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, this week has been shown in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed it technikgenie as a great modern inventors.
What apple-fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten in the recently discovered jobs-interview, which this week in particular has been filmvorführungen on the important markets entstaubt is understood, how much of the creative business head outsourcing and functioning.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a akribischer organisator, keen to diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many directors "a disease of thinking" suffering, "a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work..." but base there is a huge amount of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. "
1995 developed Bob cringely tv-serie "triumph of the fachidioten 'staff on the dawn of the computer, and he sat with jobs together longer than an hour, in which she led a rare, detailed discussions.
At this stage than 10 years have passed since jobs had been pushed from Apple, and it has already worked hard on his new computerunternehmen next, and pleased at the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of cringleys interview was used in fachidioten, he says, that the kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery lacked.
Only after jobs death, there is a full vhs-kopie discovered in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised filmmaterial forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: The Lost interview" this Wednesday and Thursday in the landmark-theater.
For someone, for which it is known that he detests Detailed interviews makes jobs are surprisingly keen in the explanation of his philosophies in technology and business strategies.
And incredibly pause.
In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly abwägt's thoughts and tries to accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfect days, if it seemingly impatient responded to cringelys issues and anschubst, quicker to respond to issues or nebenhandlungen of greater significance.
Before the era of pixar, iPod or iPhone included, the lost interview somehow seems incredibly intelligent, if jobs valued, what other companies with him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read. posthume appreciation expressed to the career jobs' But jobs here than to see the begierigen dreamer to leap to the original grandeur is something quite different, and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be, and should be.
Shortly after he had said all he drew Los and made it here.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews:
As he learned to lead a company:
"During all the years in business, I always question: 'Why are you doing things?," and the answer is that you always AN,: "Oh, made it easy."
No one knows why he does what he does, and nobody in the business think really carefully about things.
That is what I have said.
Jobs continues his efforts, to streamline the accounting for apple.
Puzzled, as costs have been recorded - often began with "standardkosten," which puts for mere suspicion, and were then Adapted "deviation" - it developed an automated factory, who ensured that the geschäftskosten until the smallest could be determined.
As the Pope was veralbert:
Jobs, told of the "blue box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device that you creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls to lead free.
Enthusiasm for the device much has already been written, but jobs, as he describes the blue box as an act of selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and it would test the box by a gebührenpflichtiges telephone use a telephone call, and then a working AT & t-netzwerk combine to another, while so many durchschleifen satellites as possible.
"We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if you go to telephone grölte, came of it again a minute later, in telephone next door," kichernd told jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we did n't know much, but we could build this small Ding, that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that Apple would be without them.
Jobs told further from a glorious trick played, the Wozniak and he had withdrawn almost as you in the middle of the night via blue box in the Vatican anriefen and speak with the Pope wanted to, while Henry Kissinger nachmachten as best they could.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night herbeigerufen were to speak with the American diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
As he is in the technology verliebte and unprepared Bill Hewlett anrief:
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, he sought to build a frequenzzähler, according to Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and called him.
Shortly after taking 20-minütigen telephone call received a teilzeitjob in Hewlett-Packard jobs for the summer.
"That was a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company it was and how well his staff treated."
Later, jobs was one of the hp-mitarbeiter who visited the company's laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop-computer ever to be made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with braunscher röhre and I verliebte in him.
I would take the HP climb upwards as a teenager and hinge on this machine and programmes for they write.
As we improve innovation:
Several times in the interview talks about jobs, as one new products erfindet spontaneously.
Some platinen early in his career, when he einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the whole zusammenzubauen computers.
He worked with a delay of just 30 days and had to think through both the zusammenbau and manufacture the extradition of the equipment.
He later in Apple recall the problems he had in the development of a computermaus:
"I remember overwhelming arguments... you schrien me, that it would take five years to build" a mouse, which would cost $300 base and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer. "
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for $15, the incredible was credible.
On big companies, the slowdown:
Long before he made apple revival saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants stumble with their vision got lost and the control of their shares.
"We say that they work in IBM or Xerox, so they make a better kopierer or printers, so what?"
They do not have the aktienmonopol, so the company is more successful.
Sales and Marketing make it successful, "Are these people having the lead the companies and the product, which pushed the people from the decision making.
The produktgenie, which has led to this monopoly, the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handwerkskunst necessary.
That happened in Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times greater, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
On innovation as art:
"There is plenty of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product... if we developed this great idea, changing it and grow."
We are learning a lot about its subtleties.
It must be votes to certain things that you ca n't, but pair electrons, glass, robots, factories.
5,000 things we must find these concepts, and all of them together...
Ultimately, it amounts to taste, it is that you are trying to address with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these things together, what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great, was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, zoologen, historians, which happens to be the best computer scientists in the world are common.
It would have been not the computer, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia adopts and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the gesundheitsgesetze, a court case
On the day, in which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the teilende political issue, whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama's gesundheitsgesetze, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, at dinner, the practice has been gesponsort, that will take the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting, to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases handled was a complaint, the 26 states have risen up against the broad reform of health care, which were agreed by Congress last year, a law that was the slogan in the conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed with the hearing and is in March, a 5 1/2-stündige grundlagendiskussion expected, probably the result will probably boost the präsidentschaftskampf 2012, at a time when the decision is made public, will be in full swing.
The lawyer, in court and argue that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, once attorney under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements Chancellery, Bancroft pllc, was one of the nearly two dozen companies, the annual dinner of the federalist society, an ancient group, which covers the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which represents the dinner has sponsored, Jones day, one of the associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, the contest the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., financially in the outcome of the process is hugely involved.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among other things, Mitch McConnell fraktionschef of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health
The guests of the dinners? scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit events to the federalist society for years.
And it is not against moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judge ruled.
If they were, they would probably fall under 4C principle of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in benefizveranstaltungen law near and other organizations, with the judges no spokesman, guest of honor or according to the programme should not be guest of such events."
Nevertheless scalia ranged the Extreme proximity and Thomas to two of the has passed in connection with the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, in order to alert moral-und-regierungsaktivisten.
"The startling break with morality and The contrast with The Code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the Court is by the same rules that apply to all other federal judge ruled," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"won the judges and dinnierten during a benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings on court."
Its performance and its support for a spendenaktion for this event undermine any claim to be impartial and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics, who say they are gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups which are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society, mix.
And Thomas' wife ginni is a known conservative activist.
The Conservatives claim, however, that it was Judge Elena Kagan, a moral problem was not scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration, when the first gesetzesanfechtungen came before the court in the first instance.
Its critics Kagan pressed to withdraw themselves from hearing the case because of bias, as they become very involved in the defence of the law is to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
Boeing is rekordauftrag $18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 zweigängige aircraft such as the Boeing 777, with an option on a further 20 aircraft.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It is a rare news that a company gets a job more than 50 of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company is the aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co and the listenpreis for these 50 aircraft in overall rekordsumme $18 trillion.
Equally unusual contracts from Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flugzeugbestellungen.
In a forecast, which was published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2.520 aircraft worth $450 trillion needed.
Boeing announced its largest mission of all time at the weekend for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order 777: 50 zweigängige Boeing jets.
The hammerauftrag came from the Dubai airline Emirates.
The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 Dubai luftfahrtschau, an option on the purchase of another 20 aircraft, the entire listenpreis can rise to $26 trillion.
On Monday did then, according to Boeing 787-8, known as Oman Air six Boeing Dreamliner, vastly improved fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The listenpreis for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal dihora, börsenfachmann morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in the possession of the oil producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but is an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so harmful, because The country deserves a higher price of oil.
This is important, because it is less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone flugzeugbestellungen, when oil prices rise, dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Boeing's leadership in the market for großraumflugzeuge confirmed by Emirates and helps to keep the airbus-konkurrenten SAS in check, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory on the luftfahrtschau comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350, which compete directly with the 777-300er.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher nutzlast and scope.
The boeing-aktien rose 1.5% to $67,94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses seemingly election in michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon said that the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo supported by the PRI in the race for the gouverneursposten.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently their application for the Office of the Governor of muchoacan lost during the violent staatswahlen: they claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
After the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo the institutional Revolution Party, the PRI, won the race for the gouverneursposten in the western state.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the election processes and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radiointerview one day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff... they have occupied polling booths set up road blocks in the polls... and people asked," to vote for the PRI base. "
In Mexico, the PRI ruled seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they aim for a return and the victory in michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have claderon just beaten, had led in the polls before the polling day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional pan of their brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo a winner.
Silvano aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic revolutionspartei PRD, currently acting governor, came in third place, a major setback for the split and hapless left leaders for the 2012 presidential election.
Also, aureoles refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which have specialised in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has michoacan chosen to launch a military's offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still on.
A pan-bürgermeister was a week before the election, while a part for Luisa Maria Calderon and killed many candidates have withdrawn from anxiety in the local elections.
A victory for the PRI strengthens the party, regardless of how vicious the elections in michoacan appear.
The man who represented the PRI in the race for the presidency, probably, is Enrique pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory makes us courageously look to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, ADB calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in Its severe debt crisis, in order to prevent a long downward trend, Asia will restrict the growth of the economy.
Rajat Nag, Executive Director of the ADB, which is based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest growing economies "must do everything in its power" to the recovery of the währungsblocks either by the International Monetary Fund, or by direct reciprocal arrangements to be speeded up.
He warned against the BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China, the "leidenschaftslos" Look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support from the European leaders and the European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long collapse of the global economy.
"We are all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary Union, in recent months, in a serious debt crisis.
In the last few days, Italy interest expense dangerous and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The arrival of heavy debt crisis in Europe, fears that the global economy could tip into recession and led to call, the leading emerging economies, to join forces to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any support of Asia will be channelled through the IMF, said, however, that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the eu-rettungsfonds, for example, the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF greater bargaining power offer - the European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade minister, said that "India is going to do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, because the economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying up of foreign freer flow of capital.
"No one wants the euro zone remains unstable, and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing big challenges and we need to maintain a high level of wachstumsebene."
"It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else are we work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, if you are facing major economic challenges.
Ashutosh varshney Brown, a professor at the American University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India aid for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 or less per day.
"At some point, they will find that the Greeks go at the age of 50 and spend holidays on the beach. then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Executive Director of the weltwirtschaftforums similar asked why India's reserves should be used in Greece, the numerous and well paid to retain employees in the public sector, with jobs in low geleitetet losses einbringenden organs, such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone will have "significant knock-on effects" on the whole of Asia.
The ADB forecast with a 7.5% economic growth in Asia for the years 2011 / is now facing the risk of gradation "because of the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must "contingency plans" to build itself a downward trend and to protect a significant kapitalabwanderung their wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed the previous Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, and so he triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon's to the kriegsschauplätzen in Afghanistan and civilian fließbändern.
The Pentagon already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts by $600 trillion or more will be necessary, if Congress can not reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress in reaching an budgetvereinbarung, which will lead to the seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out on such unthinking way that would make the most of our shipping and construction unworkable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisierungsbemühungen severely damaged," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily separated from a large part of our civilian staff to and, because the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly beurlauben civilians, in order to achieve the objective."
"These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our concentration."
The cuts were ultimately make the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"during the kriegszeitkontingente are not directly affected by the seizure in the fight against terror, the serious interference in the grundbudget would negatively affect the kriegsbemühungen," Panetta warned.
"recruitment have been cut, leading to delays in the attitudes and the einstellungsaufsicht, in support of the war, would lead."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments on kriegszeithändler would be disrupted and the legal and political support."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Defense Ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defence Ministry would launch a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian Act," the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon, as they panettas letter.
"This is a result that we can not live with, and it is certainly suggest that we should none."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United are providing and their defence should not be allowed."
If panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will strengthen demands, exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta increasingly outspoken the possibility of cuts, even though it many years has experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the Pentagon's top, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense malte might face a bleak picture, which - with a military shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is a luftwaffengeschwader without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission," said Panetta in his inaugural address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morals and concentration is and is not in a position to start it with potential opponents."
"It is a really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details, such as Reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, our global operational and eingreiffähigkeit serious restrictions which leads to an unacceptable risk in future kriegsoperationen."
And Panetta said that some of the largest verteidigungsprojekte could fall victim to the removal, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
To this list also includes the fighter pilots f35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new bodenkampffahrzeug, the army and navy, need to replace the Humvee.
It would stop the further development and testing of the f35, it would save up to $80 billion over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step in arming, so that risks posed by China and other opponents can be overcome.
How to lie revealed
A look at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lie in everyday life.
The Republicans' presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy, to the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penh State is accused of meineids because they allegedly reports that a retired footballtrainer Young had been sexually abused.
In the past week, on an open microphone mitangehört, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to the US President, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shaking countries.
The New York congressman and internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool, when he verleugnungen in circulation, which were very quickly disproved by incontrovertible evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards accused of violations in the kampagnenfinanzierung, in connection with the secrecy of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one has seen it forgets that caused the media circus that President Bill Clinton during his second term in Oval Office, when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about also in the school and college-prüfungen are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers set their students prüfungsantworten have dastanden so that they are themselves in their leistungsüberprüfungen well.
Mentors to teach the opposite should send a message that lies and also OK.
We see how much deception?
As studies show, we lies between 10 and 200 times every day.
But, as notlügen apply many of these lies.
Another study shows that foreign each other three times in the First 10 minutes of a meeting lie.
Uncover lies to recognise or "lies" to learn is one that is important for everyone, both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as scharaden, the aim is to "property, to call you!" is the enttarnen of deception, a serious wissensbereich, based on scientific data, collected in the course of the past six decades of prestigious universities, which had extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of this research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been revealed.
Lies look in the eyes.
They stottern stammeln erröten and zappeln not always.
This, we can not conclude that this liar are difficult to detect and enttarnen.
A geübter lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth to something about the structure of the claim that the fine gesichtsausdrücke, learn about issues and timing.
I have spent several years, the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing pool of enttarnung to investigate, and it is clear that the enttarnen deception is a modern ability, it is easy to learn and helps us cope in our complex in the world, especially if the stop or the question of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good to inspire other people to their interests and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively, how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people more than introvertierte people lies, "selbstorientierte" lies presented that men more often than women, whose lies "to follow other" more - in the rule, they want to protect the feelings of others, that married people of their partner anlügen less often than unmarried people - but the lies they tell, are mostly "Fats lies."
We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed, others feel less guilty, this person angelogen.
As is, whether someone is lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behaviour of that person.
It is called "baselining," the position.
They are a point of reference for the future judge for change.
Watch the position that the laugh, the stimmqualität your versuchsperson.
They should know better, when someone normally keep with the foot trippelt, so that they are not wrong to accuse him, if he trippelt during a meetings with the foot.
Then they pay attention to anhäufungen striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
They consider this anhäufungen alarm bells, the strident, not as evidence of a enttarnung.
People who fooled, freeze, perhaps, if you try to recall their history. Perhaps, their feet in the door and they are in the direction of outcome, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch," this deep, entspannende ausatmen and the change in the attitude that if all the hard questions are over.
Fragende often wrongly indicate that a einstellungsgespräch is over, only to keep looking for this relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch.
They also pay attention to the language of their versuchsperson.
The lapse of Scott Peterson is famous, when he vergangenheitsform used when he claimed that his wife killed is still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distanzierende language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or, if you knifflige question in the whole again.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifizierende language" when they answer knifflige question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... with a good conscience."
This will be the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which is often the alarm bells.
There is no zaubermittel to enttarnen lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to them enttarnung possible.
Thanks to these skills rare anyone can become a victim of fraudsters, both in the private and professional life.
Controversial plan for the oil pipeline will be revised after exposure to delayed us-genehmigung

The 1700-meilen-pipeline, Canada has been linked to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would be 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas enters pumps.
These six states The pipeline would pass through.
Environmentalists hate you, but labour markets love it, because they appreciate that the pipeline 20,000 jobs.

The current study of the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy that the hauptprüfer says of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which is focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, has been suspended by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, the adviser to Hillary Clinton in a conflict of interest is in 2008.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, because it is in contact with TransCanada.

The Court approved the transition to digital television for 2015 in Mexico
The conversion of the analogue to digital signals in recent years around the world is one of the most important changes.
Mexico's Supreme Court - scjn -, the verfassungsklagen tabled by the Senate and the Congress against the presidential decree, and force the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 must be brought forward to 2015, due to lack of eight votes are needed to gesetzesanfechtung back.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva MEZA, was that the President Felipe Calderón did not exceeded his powers when he Decree-Law with the details of the switchover to the terrestrial digital television created.
With this decision was rejected by the Senate launched verfassungsstreit because he does not have the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality and the nicht-verfassungsmäßigkeit. So the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint, which was written by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero proposed Decree-Law for unconstitutional, to explain that, as the regulations relating to the radio and television Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones - cofetel - federale commission of telecommunications in Mexico is responsible, why would contradict the decree-law hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
Voted in favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna And Sanchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies verfassungsbeschwerden against the decree-law. The minister after the adoption of the complaints implemented Sanchez Cordero that Decree-Law no longer and asked all activities to the creation of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without being in the debate on the project, was responsible for the also the Minister Sanchez Cordero to.

"I do not believe that, if we were to do so, the independence of the regulator would undermine"; it also reminded that for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, the central State government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because this is the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes, which took place around the world in the last few years, and it leads to a better use of the radioelektrischen spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay of the changeover, she said, was a delay of the gain of the digital age, what is in the public interest, a decision which not only technical aspects, "because umfasse economic, social, political and security issues."
Made these affairs, said, "the action of the whole system required in accordance with the principle of economic management by the State included a group of characteristics, which in the hands of the central State Government, the constitution."
It has reminded that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital conversion, on the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
We could not conclude that the government with the publication of the gesetzesdekrets contested in the powers of the Congress eingreife because the laws passed by the legislature would be observed, "she assured.

Mexico's Supreme Court decided on 9 November - scjn on the local legislative verfassungsklage and tabled, the voice of the staatsbeauftragten assessed on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal," because this does not have the right to "decide or a veto against it."

Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy, in order that the new government to the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of wirtschaftszusammenbruchs to defy.
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy, in order that the new government to the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of wirtschaftszusammenbruchs to defy.
A communication from the präsidentschaftspalast announced that appointed Monti is on Sunday would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm to the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats zusammengesetztes Cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will assume office.
Monti said he the president would present the results of the talks with political parties to form a government.
"I want my complete confidence in the ability of our country, to deal with these difficult times, confirm," said the former Commissioner of the journalists.
Monti confirmed does not preclude the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
The "is now well defined," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, while Italy fighting against a political and financial crisis, which has driven the cost of the debt in an intolerable level.
New, the former European Commissioner Mario Monti, the government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the europolitikern to restore battered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush, the burden on Monti, accelerated by the volatile market, as a result of the Italian government bonds have been burdened with 7 per cent interest rates for 10 years, which is the state, in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma marcegaglia, President of the Italian industrieverbands confindustria told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government after all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy emerges from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success, with the support of the party pdl of Silvio Berlusconi, the increased substantially as a result of the crisis had to resign, on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the Professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said angelino Alfano, Secretary of the central right party.
The support of the Italian pdl, the largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed to a majority of technocrats, Monti is, of whom existing government.
Support from Parliament
Monti's new government probably needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delay the reforms could deliver another devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Federation of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure of Monti's is a disaster, also pressures.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations and youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening, the sitzungsrunde should be completed.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, as the response to the crisis has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After recently revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister of the costs for the Italian government bonds reached critical borders.
A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, those would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his Government was up to the next election, expected in 2013 will be held, despite the predictions that the politicians take time to implement the reforms, rather than him over the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns regarding the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources suggest that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from political life is complicated.

For your costaricanischen fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Is a dream to play in Costa Rica, which achieved for us.
This is the second time that we play in South and Central America and, until now, it has been great.
I am only once been on holiday in Costa Rica, and it is such a beautiful country, we determined that a couple of days they will stay there.
It is exciting for us to bring our music out there.
I ask you that because the fans of the band completely revealed, and see the days before the concert intensivst.
What does your your begeistertesten fans?
Thank you, all these years to be on our side.
We have taken almost 21 years, until we arrived in Costa Rica, thank you, and we are sorry to have waited so long as long as needed, until we got here.
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have staged over the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played for a couple of riesenshows in Sao Paulo and we hope that the US fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we are happy to surf, and the jungle is enthusiastic, for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you have got to know their Costa Rica and Its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend site and I have a great friend, who lives in tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always the surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua dangers, along with Mexico, the excellent places to surf, and in this way, that we have people that love surfing encounter.
With an eye on the tournee have offered their riesenshows with many liedern.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we have never played there, we are no boundaries.
We are going to try to be the best show with many different liedern. We want to play a couple of song from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
Her your repertoire never repeated.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine records and more than 120 songs can play another song. Everyone likes, so that each of the decision, which we are going to play, is not easy.
If we have two or three song, which we have been played no longer, the repertoire to we can maintain our focus better and surprise us, because they remember the reasons why we did this song; otherwise, they may have been forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe, for the audience.
With this tournee celebrates her your years of history.
If you zurückschaut, it is hard to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I think that none of us has presented, even in a great rock band to play, and that more than 20 years, and this is like a dream.
We are also further on this blessing and find it great, and are still able to make music together.
We may and we are enthusiastic to produce music.
We are fortunate to be able to go to the places of the world, which we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you to have actively participated in the birthplace of grunge?
It has always been an honour to belonging to this group of large bands.
We are good friends with people of Soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and rather unusual, when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
A bond emerges from a city now and again, but it is unusual to see five or ten groups at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the seattle-gruppe.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in chains and Canada with mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tournee. We look forward, still to be friends with all of you and it's honorable that have us, part of this arisen seattle-sounds.
It is very unusual for a bond zusammengeblieben so long as your with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and little Mr Cameron met us 13 years ago, which is much more time than many bands alone last.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive, and also we care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical opened a path which each of the freedom to experiment.
A familiar other and its music, and it could not be better off.
Your relationship with the glory is not always easy, on the other hand, konntet thanks to your success always do what your wolltet.
How will take place her balance?
The way in which we are grown, has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We are safe, not too often tournee, because it is too easy to love this game with huge crowds your music, to lapse.
Until you consider that the people are because of the music here, reminds you this because the music and what it has created, eighth must, without intent to be a famous rockstar. This has never interested anyway.
What memories you have on your other project mother love bone?
I think we have very good song written and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy - Andrew Woods had never issued a plate.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce - fairweather and Greg, GILMORE, which built the bond, a friend of mine with us, when I hear a song or see photos, I think because of what an incredible person was Andy, and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure, to go to work, to laugh together and talking about music and football and many other topics.
It was an extraordinary person, and we miss him.
Read the domestic bond robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Knows, it is true that their work, especially Eddie vedder, and the band have picked for the opening?
Yes, the production of videos of several groups and sent us this bond appealed to us best and that is why we are curious to see what robertas read live can offer, which will definitely exciting.
Why does the text of yellow Ledbetter always playing, if you live?
That is a question for ED - Eddie vedder, I have no idea.
He is, and I believe that is the first that occurs to him.
Wurdest you as a bassist influenced by whom?
By so many +
Among the first, which I thought, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski...
There are so many throughout the afternoon, I could talk about the bassisten liked,.
As Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, even though there is no longer a modeerscheinung?
I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands strike me, which I have mentioned, for example, mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who were raised at the same time, if they are still important, I think it is great, because it is good to hear this music and bands as mudhoney better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of song on the new album, the somewhat lightly could work, but there are other songs such as the end or just breathe, considered very dark song, although they have something positive in itself.
On both came to me in tears when I heard Ed they played, and it is very dark song.
I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happens in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your artistic creation and your music and these two song represent clear for me.
However, I also believe that you be a happier person and still dark music.

Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees in favour of the tender.
The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of collserola again in Barcelona.
In the 1980s, the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona, CMB, this administration published its schmähschrift on the promotion of collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park city in Barcelona.
He was even in figures compared with New York's Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in nord-süd-richtung spread, but upwards of mountains and down to the sea.
The classification collserolas as National Park to play with this idea.
Served as model is no longer the central park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogibärs.
So far, it was in September, when the city a riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 to competitions, for further zugangstore after collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a parks.
Either that, or someone has gates to country.
The question is: collserola park or mountain itself?
The tender is not only from organisational point of view, but also in terms of the debate in the mouths of a reflection on the city of architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes subject on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who are meeting in the lift up resort.
And this very fact provides fodder for one of the rare matches between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel roldán Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
It is necessary for roldán ,"" according to the attack on the coast on the "Front On mountains to talk about" if the discourse of ildefons CERDA, on the green apples, has not been resolved.
"You should start from the principle that is taken extremely Park beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is complex, "Judgments of the architect, for the title of" gates of collserola "an" impressive event is: "You should not" be access to a park to imagine, but as narrowing of areas where action is needed. "
Modol, such as roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "inherent in a number of dangers."
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty and the creation of a public space today with the situation" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum had their "swan song."
The first fear is its own limit to what can be developed.
"Limit always means something to determine the next step," i.e., to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments because the current" regarding the general plan metropolitano - PGM base can lead to a real disaster. "
Modol, close to the question of the simplified, believes the side of collserola, in the direction of vallesana "can not be understood as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, for purely topografischen reasons."
Modol, pointed out that there is already a study by patronat de collserola should not "fall on deaf ears," even though he was grateful to the city council that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project, "from the first moment."
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the city in the geleitbrief is gebirges, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although it expresses his "Doubt" Whether this technical profile multidisciplinary team launched the 'right', he says, "We should give - Guidance to architects should only be a tool."
Bayona implies that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as has in the tender conditions of collserola lack a global vision: "There have been 16 competitions in of advertised," he says, "the axis gebirge-meer. But there is no längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety."
It has, at least in his case meant that he participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, would the programme and the definition of a project for a goal of the architects of The ToRs then colliding.
His view that the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length as required, the soft transition between city and grünzonen emerge.

He stressed that the investigation at the sportplatz Cuauhtémoc - in west of the state of México - began in the sportplatz of nezahualcóyolt, and since the October 8 in the east of the state of México will continue.
If the target of 500 to 600 untersuchungspersonen is reached, the study will have the sportplatz of Independencia, in the south of the hauptstadtbezirks continued and on the Morelos, in the north of the hauptstadtbezirks concluded.
He explained that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Day of diabetes, he said it is going to three thousand children and young people under the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors that could lead to diabetes or niereninsuffizienz, to control.
He also that in these samstagen led the untersuchungspersonen, weight, size, taillenumfang, measured their blood pressure controlled, and blutwerte as the glukosespiegel, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors - attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity were determined.
Cruz López stressed that investigation would at the concerns of the health workers conducted on the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the proportion of obese boys by 77%, and the girls with obesity have increased by 47% and obesity has increased dramatically," the specialist of the IMSS stressed.
He was, the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico from the other peoples differences.
It was that A - E - Mexicans - in - on average to indianisch-amerikanischer, 65 per cent to 5 per cent to 30 per cent of European and African descent is what is in the genes, which are associated with diabetes and obesity reflects.
In general, he said, the genetics of obesity am in the inability to put the surplus of US Energy - calories to burn, so this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the put research participants is a comprehensive study of the children, found in the dignity, whether it is a degree of obesity or obesity showed.
It would even the dark hautfalten occur in the nacken and innenarm - akanthosis, which highlight the likelihood of stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes in the preliminary stage, is investigating.
All of the information would be kept confidential and explain to the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors told the parents of all the values of and are proposing changes to the way of life to you, the prevention of diseases are appropriate.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors, which are responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: exercise, which means a lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day on the television and transport short routes to go on foot to be used instead.
The high kalorienaufnahme, which means that increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and kohlenhydraten - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc. - combined with a High fat and eiweißaufnahme and genetics to be analysed in this project.
Asphalt of the UNAM schlaglöcher prevented
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with polymeren modified asphalte, in order to make the mix of robust to weather and temperature fluctuations
Would be on the sign, which come from the straßenbelag, respected, there would be no need to repair Nearly 200 000 schlaglöcher, when the rainy season zona Metropolitana del Valle de México - stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico - erupts, said Rafael Herrera nájera, researchers at the university's school of chemistry, FQ to UNAM, warning and assured that if the interpretations and the maintenance of asphaltbelags properly happen, the number of schlaglöcher significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
In his lecture "from a technical point of view," he schlaglöcher held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymeren modified asphalte developing in order to establish a similar mix asphalt, but more mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures in.
Herrera nájera, said that this type of modified asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and, therefore, to avoid the appearance of schlaglöchern.
He stated that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - is a kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, part of which has a high molekulargewicht - so asphaltene mentioned - and the other part of a low - the 'malthene. Together, they give the straßenbelag his characteristic zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the asphalts means that this is how a liquid is at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it is very zähflüssig at 120 degrees and 50 ° C almost note, while it is crumbling at extremely low temperatures.
"This means that the strength of the asphalts on the streets is not gleichförmig, but on a day depending on the weather and temperature fluctuations change ', led the chemieingenieur.
The majority of the FQ researchers noted, the streets of Mexico City have a flexible straßenbelag of six materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt included.
Between the top layers is a verschleißschicht asphalt, from small, insisting in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Every single piece of this verschleißschicht, had been in asphalt gebadet.
If the vehicles travel and forces, will allow this class creates a good kräfteverteilung in straßenbelag.
"If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better," said the chemieingenieur.
"Over the verschleißschicht interpreted," he led, "will be a last layer, known as the tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which has also been in asphalt gebadet.
Because of this shift in contact with the tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the verschleißschicht and it must produce friction.
The straßenbelag receives the majority of forces and distributed to the tragschicht also needs a proper thick and the material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions in particular, humidity and temperature changes, further, important factors to be taken into consideration, and above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the verschleißschicht significantly.
If the site is wet, filthy water again in the class and is just difficult. That causes a relaxation of all sections of the surface and as a result, the incidence of schlaglöchern.
When a schlagloch emerge, "he said," First of all, the deckschicht abgetragen affected, while the verschleißschicht then, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first signs by adequate wartungsprogramme should be maintained. "
The member in sistema nacional de Investigadores - system of national innovation of Mexico - said that the fahrzeuglast another important reason for the emergence of schlaglöchern is, so must the thickness of each layer on the surface are always in relation to fahrzeuglast and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent schlaglöchern this arrangement will be adhered to.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research on would wait to in other countries, even on asphaltemulsionen, for example, are already on the market, and with which the schlaglöcher simply and without use of high temperatures could fix.
Del Valle, which lacked the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors playing around the fact that Melina Ramírez serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14 misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the Crown for Miss Colombia.
This time was Melina Ramírez serna content, on to the gewinnerpodium, a silberkrone and demonstrated the bond that you as the new Miss Colombia, for show.
In Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico with the result that night received the Crown and the zeder in itself, is the Departamento on 14 misstitel and Melina joining the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had kept the crown almost in the hands. misses include: Miriam ospina proclaimed to the Benoit, 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero - 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala, 1979, Lorena Alvarez, of 1981, Rose Mary alzate of 1983, Olga María arenas - 1987, Leila blanque - 1988 - Mónica Evers - 1989, María Consuela Pinedo - 1990, Diana Isabel Romero 1993, Giselle Garcés aljure - 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure in 2008.
The big question today, many are asking is: what is missing?
Because the result is the demise of a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to make the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain to Queen of the police and the mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, title, including the schönheitsköniginnen taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial for the jury's decision to appoint the first Miss, is that it has the answer to the question "What book you most and why?," which affects their Martín Murillo Gómez from the carreta literaria leamos had been raised, was not convinced.
The young woman in Valle del Cauca replied to the author:
"I read a lot, I think quite the literature, I believe it is a way to civilise, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, 'der small Prince ', a deep book.
Today, I read'schuld and Punishment, "and it is a book of universal culture that we all should read, I read a book by Irene nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, The'leidenschaften '.
One MET with little gegenliebe, firstly because of'sich civilise 'and, secondly, because they do not have a real, had declared how each of her book she had influenced. "
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people, read a bit'den please small prince, "and it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle ausgebrannt.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the favourite, all of which beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices, gastronomie-wettbewerb OSTER, publikumsabstimmung the best handgeschneiderte kostüm and Reina Madre, "had made the other candidates jealous, is what the Queen stresste and therefore could not shine on the stage."
And it said its first presentation to the swimming suit on the beach of the hilton-hotels and their two lifts in the krönungsfeier.
Although they appeared in two sure, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en Casa," the channel RCN argued that the fact that Melina on has been crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate during the competition, the most of the prices not queen wins, after all."
Valle was also out of the way - a mistake at the end of the press.
Another hypothesis is that Valle, the jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not convince the essentials of the National schönheitswettbewerbs.
It will have its reason for two days before the creation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty said they were a woman, the dedication to their country's Social Affairs.
"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia; you have on the physical hinausschauen and focus on the social experience, that is to say, that they had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle, with its defects of the derriere and fibrosis, be it in the magengegend said, had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for'natürliche beauty 'with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there is better, "but the problem is with the fibrosis in the stomach for me frankly unlikely to notice was given, expressed their marks on the last day."
Meanwhile, the magazine is the journalist Guido Hoyos of cromos believe that the mistakes of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgery, which they had submitted to.
"The operations are OK, but should Valle did not know how they can get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and this is where she had to pay. "
Because of this prize, which will be the first time the national beauty contest, emerged after the appearance in the swimming suit a cruel forecast, which was in the night, there should be true. getuschelt, that had been raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they do not benefit from the Crown.
Regardless of whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their herrschaftsjahr office, not as Queen, but as a princess, a position the opportunity on appointment of the national schönheitswettbewerbs Colombia to represent one of the international competitions.
It is a one of the queens, however, which, despite its overwhelming auftritts, Cartagena escaped the crown was to go down in history.
It was the work of the doctor, identified the body of Alfonso cano
A lophoskopist Cali was identified as the man, "Alfonso cano," in history.
The work of these officials, plays a key role.
On 4 November, a lophoskopist of the last ermittlungseinheit Prosecutor's Office - CTI - Cali than the man, the identity of the leader of the FARC - Fuerzas Armadas revolucionarias de Colombia - the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - confirmed: "Alfonso cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, was eliazar González standby duties this week, a man from Puerto tejada for 21 years in criminal investigation cooperate.
At the beginning of his career Chocó González worked in communities, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days in order to achieve the place, in which the bodies were, he should identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialised he lophoskopie, this is the investigation of the skin is exposed to the friction, i.e., the pieces of baggage and fußflächen.
In the week the use against known as Alfonso cano was einzupacken eliazar pointed out, clothes for at least three days.
Nothing much awaited him.
He flew in helicopters from palmira to Cauca Friday night.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was the suspicion that a man, of the ältestes guerrilla had led the world could be, so he should be the zehnfinger-abdruckblatt by Guillermo León sáenz, real name take.
When he reached with the untersuchungste place, however, where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was the images, which he had seen in the media, not in the slightest.
He did not have a beard, was dressed as a pawn of the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do n't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a pflanzkelle eliazar the fingerprints of the body and a taschenlampe compared with those in the abdruckblatt.
He was right: it was seen "Alfonso cano."
Was still the same night from the man responsible for the Secretary of Defense, Puerto tejada and Juan Carlos pinzón say that it really was the leader of the FARC.
On spurensuche
For a daktyloskopen of sijín In Cali was praising the president, Juan Manuel Santos eliazar González at a press conference on the fight against "cano" has given, is very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they support an investigation into mord- raubsachen and confirm the identity of the person arrested.
False documents in their arrest are many criminals or you have none.
We take you the fingerprints and look them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to seize on a little wall a theft from a house, because the thief had exactly at this point with his hand aufgestützt, as it is a fully gestopften safe herauszog with jewellery and money.
"walls are difficult, because of their oberflächen are unsuitable for the collection of fingerprints, but in this case we have abdruck throughout the hands and identify the offenders who had participated in several theft," he recalled.
Also mordverdächtige discharge or through the fingerprints can be burdened.
Recently, a dead was found surrounded by spirit bottles.
During the investigation, suspected that a family member, and could actually be tatverdächtig agreed a fingerprints on the bottle.
Although it does not guarantee that it is the murderer, as it is with the place, in which the crime was committed, put in context.
A daktyloskopist of CTI declared that, "the chemical and physical reagenzen fingerprints were excluded from the object."
When they appear, a pflanzkelle or a bond used to transport.
Then are sent to the abdrücke Asif, this is the verbrecherdatenbank, or to personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented," declared the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is, as the tv-serie would SCI presented.
So not everything is gold, which is, that is not what we anfasst, fingerprints.
But it can be used, if you have a relevant comparison of fish.
The "indignant" are challenging the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed in tents on the zuccotti-platz.
A large proportion of the räumungsbefehl came to and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement ocupy Wall Street on this Tuesday urged the authorities out New York, as they once again tried to enter the manhatten-platz, with a court order after they were evacuated in the dawn of the place and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators urged the zuccotti-platz together, on which you are with a court order, which allowed "indignant" at this point the renewed tents, wanted to gain access, Meanwhile, another part of the movement to the räumungsbefehl and occupied a park further north, where it was nine arrests in the city.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to campen on the square, we have gathered in another place and continue the battle with the return to zuccotti legal means, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman of the Movement "ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the response of the "outraged" at the evacuation of their zeltlagers directly from Michael Bloomberg had been ordered, the Mayor of New York, was up in court, where the judge Lucy Billings, to an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and the protesters' tents approved.
Also occupied the "indignant" a new park, which is located at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entry in the holland-tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church.
They could fill the place for at least one hour. But later met the police and arrested some of the demonstrators, although no exact figures Bray. He assured the Agency EFE, including several journalists have seen handcuffed.
The organization stated that it would have joined hundreds of people at this point, in which a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and were for mediation with the police arrived.
Now is the zuccotti-platz - a site in property - closed in anticipation of a court hearing, which is scheduled for this Tuesday, and in terms of the legality of at the crack of dawn held clearing will be analysed.
Some of the place getriebenen demonstrators had been photocopies of this court ruling on themselves and distributed them, and even some of the policemen, the place they gave them bewachten, which led to "some small clashes," as Bray reported, which had indicated that a number of police officers have beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities, members of occupy Wall Street to clear the place, and the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to ban the protesters with their tents and other things, which they had used before," return to the park.
Mayor Bloomberg before the press makes it clear that as a result of this judicial order to the new opening the place for the publikumsverkehr and the demonstrators had been lifted, and the protestors, he pointed out that the stadtgesetze did not allow them to set up tents and schlafsäcken again in this place.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of zuccotti-platzes conducted at the crack of dawn, in which nearly 200 people have been arrested, and it was decided that because the demonstrators' against the right verstießen. "
Bloomberg said that he had given the order for the evacuation of the place, because it had "turned into a place to demonstrate to the people, but to break the law and, in some cases, came to harm other people," because "some business had received threats" and the residents bangten "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation at the crack of dawn was ekelhaft and shows that Bloomberg basically on protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, the mayor of the anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "occupy Wall Street" informed that it nachdächten to organise "great actions" on Thursday, together with gemeindeorganisationen and trade unions, in order for the two months the protests now take to commemorate the 17th September.
Pamela Anderson is in the tv-weihnachtsshow the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will on 1 December in the tv-programm 'It's a Russell Peters deserve a pat' appearance
The kanadierin Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen assistant in "home improvement," rettungsschwimmerin in "Baywatch," Rabbit "Playboy," the wife of the rockmusikers Tommy Lee and now the actress and model, in a weihnachtssendung of Canadian television the Virgin Mary.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crooner 'balladensänger Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on 1 December in the tv-programm' It's a Russell Peters deserve a pat "appearance and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV widespread images of the channel, in which Anderson today - which gedrehten for a spread on the Internet itself pornos, in which they, along with her former husband, the schlagzeugspieler 'Mötley Crüe, "Tommy Lee, think - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in the fold, the Jesus to appearance.
In the scene, Peters, an acquaintance of Canadian comedian indianischer origin, 'My violent recently as a facilitator in the programme Charlie Sheen worked, as jesuskind torpedo of truth. "
The weihnachtsprogramm CTV does not only on Anderson and Peters, also on the Canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model luisana lopilato married, and not miss this controversy.
Recently, Bublé at one of his concerts in New York, the nordamerikanerin Kim kardashian called "hure."
Japan after the earthquake is reborn
The GDP growing by 1.5%, thanks to the inlandskonsums and stop the cycle of a free fall at the beginning of March
Since last March, Japan's economy was paralyzed after the devastating earthquake, which are still in recovery, a nuclear crisis einmündete, and had seen the worst disaster, Japan is the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the damage to property, a blow to $300 000 weaken, despite the difficult weltwirtschaftslage seems.
After three quarters of the case, the data on gross domestic product between July and September to finally close this chapter: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% of the hochgerechnete quota for the year.
The recorded value - in Japan in the second quarter marks the beginning of the financial year in March 2012, is also the fastest growth for the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly by the maschinenverkauf for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas said.
Actually increased the company's investments by 1.1% compared to the drop of 0.9% on investments, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Nevertheless, the real transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely keynsianischen anstößen that take advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Woken up, Japan is in particular, thanks to the development of the inlandskonsums, now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, initiated by the increased spending on cars, travel and leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen, Japan's currency, in one of the "zufluchtswährungen" by investors, the debt crisis in the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A. flee, a privilege, a grabstein rests on the accounts of exporters.
With more money are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the Great technologieproduzenten.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September, back to the quotation of the yen.
While the market remains besieged the peripheral EU countries, the Government yoshihiko Noda vigilant.
"We must look at the continuing risks, the deterioration in certain foreign economies, for example, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday, motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really aufheiternd.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development - OECD explained that most of the Member States in September had actually been clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator, which vorausnimmt, brought to light the turning points of the world economy, with the biggest wirtschaftspotenzen the brakes would be taken.
Because it fell by four tenth to Los 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average of, which is 100, having fallen by eight tenths to 99,13 points.
Athens casts doubt again
Papadimos says that the austerity measures were adopted, however, the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the getriebenen risk premiums at the level of the peripheral countries and broad machender uncertainty verirrt Greece continue in the labyrinth that leads from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "Consensus" of the new Greek interim government is a response to the pressure from Brussels, rather than a genuine conviction of the political forces, is slowly backed up by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that his appointment to her hundreds of days may be too short for their implementation, they are assured of the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, antonis Samaras that the new austerity measures and not support his call for new elections on the planned date, 19 February will withdraw.
"The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," assured papadimos yesterday for opening a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new Government will reach its peak.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, to reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, does not remove Samaras communication, the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed to support the transitional government, but nowhere else."
The Conservative leader was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism, the 8.000 million, the Athens must urgently needed, entsperren, he made it clear that he would not accept pledge on the implementation of the austerity measures.
However, the European Commission, because of the impact of the pokerspiels with papandreu referendum is still confused, confirmed again yesterday, at your request is not signed, would not be changed: the economic aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreements would not" sign as soon as possible.
The speaker of the wirtschaftsministeriums, amadeu altafaj, declared that the Troika inspectors "very soon" after Athens zurückkämen to discuss with the new government, "What for payment of the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million euros, "is needed," although there is still no final date.
The Greek threads tangled knot has for a while.
Queen sofía: "These are tools for progress and hope '
The Queen said the "prevailing" position of Spain in these finanzierungsart
Spain has a dominant position in the world in the role of the kleinstfinanzierungen achieved. "
The Queen sofía Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the last two decades, the world's second donors have developed for this means of international cooperation, whose "essence" based on the fact that it is a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity was on the basis of the trust in the people."
The Queen weihte yesterday the fifth on microcredit summit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there is "no doubt" to that such transactions would be "absolutely essential" to the jahrtausendziele set by the United Nations by 2015 to reach, and "in particular, the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than $1 a day, so below the poverty line." "
Spain "also continues to work" to the extension of the begünstigtennetzes "until the last corner of the world and there is this task responsibly," said the Queen Sofia, hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will go, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have recorded many successes" and "have a lot of challenges."
The Summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to Push "two fundamental goals."
The queen said that it is going to that by end of the year 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these services and that 10 million of these households exceed the poverty line.
The concept of the microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world back to the way "initiated by Muhammad Yunus" Years ago, the Queen Sofia judged as an "act of justice and recognition."
The father of this financial instrument described it as an "admirable idealists, committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years, when the Queen came to Bangladesh to learn about the local darlehensstrategie.
On this experience, followed a year later, the First World summit in Washington and other meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006, "we all have a steady development can observe," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday the assessment as a "head" in Valladolid and moved as "spokesperson of the poor."
Finally ended the Queen Sofia your speech, by the House to take part in the debate, and inspired to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"ethics"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that Solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the whole of the democratic state.
In this sense, they stressed that it was a mistake to tie the aid in times of economic boom, because it was a "lasting commitment."
Jiménez, was of the opinion that the microcredit is "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialized nations now had to work "more than ever" after solidarity criteria, and should not allow that falls victim to the solidarity of the crisis.
For Spain, the microcredit is one of the "major forms of aid."
The Secretary of State for international cooperation, soraya Rodríguez, applauded the success, "" marginalized people, "always have closed doors to give" Hope, "and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, the welcome in a city," said öffne their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity. "
As a result of vote to choose the CDU proposes that the EU President
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats, or CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has pushed through by the autumn, especially to those activists to provide enough, the Italian Government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly tomorrow see as too lax.
The proposed European Commission präsidentschaftsantrag was adopted almost unanimously by the Bureau.
In 1001 delegates had just nine voted against, 10 had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasted several minutes, on the basis of their interventionserlässen First, Angela Merkel, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three europa-zugeneigten finance ministers were no doubt open.
The Chancellor has hauptidee - as well as the antrage following slogan: The answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on budget policy of countries in the euro zone, but it could also come in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of popular vote lead, "in order to give Europe a face."
In any case, this is one of the antragsvorschläge passed by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: groβ-britannien is opposed to the matter, and the Chief of the CDU to know, believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone is placed.
As the delegates in an overwhelming majority of the proposal of the weighting of each country in the ezb-vorstand according to the weighting of individual economies, which seems to be a erstarkung rejected by Germany's position would.
The Chancellor has therefore concerned about calming the climate within their party the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not tried to stepping up its Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulties to win, critics of the arrogant Germany would immediately.
As far as the europa-antrag the significance of "Our friendship" paragraph to France, Angela Merkel is not on the plan.
At least not directly.

What represents the fraud at krankmeldungen?
After the family allowances UMP and the government are krankmeldungen in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, a familienbeihilfekasse go and a speech on the subject - already constantly repeated since 2007 - the fight against social fraud and raise economic dependence on government.
To accompany this attack, which assumes the desire, the economy in a härteprobe, on the other hand, however, is no less subject to herald the axis of the right focus on arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen presidential campaign, is the majority.
First, with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government visiert the introduction of a fourth karenztages account of a krankmeldung to workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A maβnahme, which, according to the newspaper "Les echoes" sparking anger threatens to introduce would assist, however, 280 million euros.
And were accompanied by other maβnahme more symbolic nature: the civil servants unvergüteten karenztag on krankheitsfalle to - there has been for you, in gegensatze to three karenztagen in the private sector, no karenzfrist.
Meanwhile, these questions in the debate are the majority also sparked a fresh betrugsthematik, with this time aimed at the abuse associated with arbeitsabsenz.
Controls "will be much more important, and they have this rückzuvergüten, if it is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November to the microphone, RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of the krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already since 2002, has been the subject of constant monitoring, as well as political offensive, most have borne fruit.
The French are not more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
We spend, however, first of all, in the nationwide points.
According to the landeskrankenkasse CNAM were paid in 2006 more than 237 million euro tagesabfindungen.
Gemäβ wirtschaftsforschungs- and dokumentationsinstituts of healthcare, the tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11,3 billions of euro 5% of health care.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and accidents and 54% on krankheitsurlaube heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% expenses.
In 2010, the French to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the research, Alma Consulting Group allowed an average of only 14.5 krankentage.
Midway, certain differences masks, a different, in 2007, was published by monster.com website for Career Development, showed that 75% of the 40th 000 respondents, claims to have taken a single krankentag French workers.
Another study, this time by The insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the krankmeldungen of shorter duration than 8 days in 2010, 15%; 22% were between 8 and 14 days between 15 days and a month, 15% and 11% over between one and three months.
Compared with their European neighbours a French workers not to incapacity benefit more than elsewhere.
A in 2010 of two researchers of the French National Centre for wissenschaftsforschung, CNRS's langzeitstudie showed that the global absenzquote between 1994 and 2001, illness or otherwise justified oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud at krankmeldungen represents a tiny percentage of the black economy.
With regard to the fraud will be achieved only a weak ausmaβ here.
Encouraging legislation since 2002, means that there is systmatische controls on krankmeldungen which exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM - public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers - found that 13% of 285.000 under 1.5 million controls of the past - short krankmeldungen, or the heiβt in 37.050 cases, "unjustified" were too long.
With the krankmeldungsfällen systematically control more than 45 days duration was one of 11% to 1.2 million unangepassten or unjustified "cases, the heiβt 132.000.
All of this makes 169.000 "unjustified" cases in several millions of workers, who have made use of a krankmeldung.
A paragraph, which represents only a weak ausmaβ to, for example, of the black economy.
According to the ump-abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of one published in July sachberichts regarding this issue, this is steuergewinnausfall between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, that is to say, more than the total cost of tagesvergütungen and thus far more than the last defraudation in.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new anpassungsplan
Greece have a new necessary adjustment to interception of its economy.
This had on Monday 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament add in the fact that the 100 days not adequate, given his government from the Union in order to do this task.

The rights rejected the new sparmaβnahmen
Antonis on Monday Samaras, leader of the right wing, had already approved its approval of the experiment aimed maβnahmen in terms of the escape from the debt crisis, said, however, that his party would not ready for an additional sparmaβnahme erkären.
"We will not vote in favour of new maβnahmen," he said at a abgeordnetenversammlung his new Democracy Party.
He had agreed with the requirements of the reduction of the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against the waste, was hostile to any policy, however, would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and währungsaufgaben betrauter was eu-kommisar blocking the IMF and the EU, the necessary not without a written guarantee loans more than 8 billion euros of all parties on their support of the planned release maβnahmen, Antonio Samaras replied that his words had enough and he would sign anything under pressure from auβen.
Euthanasia and begleiteter freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The body, said that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment for the best schmerzlindernden money, and on the cancer beyond.
The Canadian Society lives in a state of death.
Only 9% of Canadians are really point to talk with their doctors about conditions under which they would die and make operation for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, was involved in the six experts in various disciplines, including Ethics, Law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body, the Government recommends changes to the Penal Code so to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients, which are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude EIU the experts cite a recent survey by the independent society, the erdballes had compared the todesqualität in 40 countries.
Although Canada has placed it in the 10th grade, the study noted that "The Medical sterbebetreuung in Canada, has led to a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers means, tell us the Royal Society of Canada ordered experts.
And despite the majority of Canadians desire to die at home, however, die eventually 68,6% of those in hospital.
The whole country terms, the rate seen in hospital with 86% of sterbefällen highest in Quebec.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, want to make any changes to the Penal Code on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, entgegengerichtet.
But now there are, according to the experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries inspected, the approach of legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or use, have no proof that such a decriminalisation miβbräuche in their application, praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem unkompetenten or not consenting persons would lead to suicide.
On the contrary find it far more cases of breaches in the countries in which euthanasia and begleiteter suicide are not legalised, as yesterday Jocelyn downie, a signatory of the report in a teleconferencing confirmed.
"Euthanasia is illegal in Canada, where they will clearly, practised."
"begleiteter suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that, according to a angus-reid-umfrage already carried out in 2010 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert, as they are of the opinion that this would have had people at the end of their lebensweges to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue did not lead to the legalisation of euthanasia, to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people besäβe worth less.
In terms of people who already have done an assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to maintain or suspension of funding in patients, situation is less clear, as the author of the report.
As this in their empfehlungsverzeichnis suggests that ought to be indicated in the Penal Code that sell the available resources, for which a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal.
The Panel of Experts also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task, sell a funds at the end of life to be respected, and that without having to fear prosecution.
The body, said that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment for the best schmerzlindernden money, and on the cancer beyond.
Least asks that the body already in the Canadian institutions for healthcare in the extensive means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender maβnahmen, consider this, at least, as these as little as euthanasia intended to reduce physical pain and they are on the same procedure bezögen.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts on the territory of health care have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada expertenberichts.
Council Pierre Deschamps, expert in gesundheitsrecht, among other things, the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts, described as "extremely" as they euthanasiepraxis in patients in the end have no borders.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone, lebensmüde and older than 18 years, a different person to ask, to help him in his suicide," Council Deschamps, who had studied a summary of the report yesterday.
Council Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social gewirke society.
But now, he says, were "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist for gesundheitsrecht, has "expressed a strong resistance" from the conclusions of the report, as titulierte "pro-euthanasie-manifest."
Margaret Somerville either, which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially the berichtsangaben regarding the nichtvorliegens abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and begleiteter suicide legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

The United States has in turn the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime," as a result of the decisions taken by the Arab League and the European Union begrüβt.
"international community, the United States, the European Union, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have an increasingly sharper tone in the face of the repression in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the staatsabteilung.

He has, with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its tasks, to react, in his opinion, is a "dangerous step."

Energy policy:
Facts About dogmas should prevail
An issue that does not exist can be dealt with on the basis of short stories or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity in direct maβe influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company.
It is reasonable to take a wahltreffen for a reason to think about this issue, as well as on the position of the nuclear power.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should your opinion on objective facts, rational data fundieren.
Although there are 7 billion people on the planet, is the demographic evolution forward a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, should not be deprived of a vital element a huge share of the world's population.
At the same time the scarcity of fossil resources must be reversed, in order to continue to consistently produce electricity, without the pressing need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, from the environmental debate verschwundenes, to forget, to combat climate unregelmäβigkeiten.
None of these parameters changed the Fukushima accident.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, its decision in the need for substitutionsfähige ersatzquelle intends to find, still in Switzerland, the time, the last generation to build nuclear power plants.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states, continue to pursue their Projects against with determination.
The United States itself after Fukushima have decided that their anzugliedern park a further unity by the following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident decommissioned work again in operation.
Even if the aimed at renewable energy sources, German Model is sometimes as an example, the reality is, however, the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in elektrizitätspreises, strengthened by the increased use of importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, reflected an increase of being caused by gas and coal plants CO2 emissions.
The sum of these unfortunate effects will be already felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives pause for thought.
Denmark is in one of European tabellenführer about wind energy from the 30% of its electricity is, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used it in turns with wind power, which are his co2-ausstösse and elektrizitätspreis by 65%, respectively, and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% more elektrizitätsrechnung.
As the price of energy, a key role of competitiveness in the global economy and a stabilitätspfand industry at the national soil, the French companies have an advantage because the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in energiepreises, therefore, what our country's noble comments on the reindustrialisierung and the defence of Liesse purchasing power to the illusion.
Polls showed that the price of being groβe majority of the French nor is prepared to pay demonstrates, as opposition to the principle of this source of energy.
We remember that our nation's energy policy has made it possible, an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 build induzierten jobs.
Because of their strong exportcharakters brings with it a host of specialised small and small enterprises on the international markets and makes the creators of jobs.
France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power, which groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros in investitionsgüter- and kernenergieexport would be more and more zusammenschrumpfen.
What elektriker would to work on 60 years is designed EPR mandating the decline of its producers, if inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are as little as a teufelswerk is a panacea for the production of electricity.
The company Areva developed low carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest level of security for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security agency, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the building in flamanville manner.
The arbeitsteams, which, because of their professionalism, the sicherheitsvorstellung have just made a name to mad.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
Only one in Three Mile Island is happened under normal operating conditions; he was without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was created by reaktorkonstruktion and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry is their lessons and learn from this accident, as it had done after the previous two.
As a result of this course of action and cooperation of the intelligence agencies of the French and German industrialists and operators of nuclear power plants, the EPR a draft to its resistance to such things.
As it is considered among the elektrotechnikern and desirable to build a nuclear power station, would be a freeze in flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by giving them free rein Liesse, the leadership in the inevitable kernkraftentwicklung to reissen.
It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and parteimanöber dominate debate, which also been economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Of Nicolas Sarkozy, the immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to the figures submissive policy, the reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," such as France had call themselves.
Recently had the harassment directed at foreign students of administrative side, the Interior Minister had marked the wochenschauen incidental - see Libération on 23 May - announced that France "have no talent, bricklayers or waiter from abroad need."
But this policy was seldom analysis from the economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.
From right side was the stance of Jacques Chirac, 1976, had declared that "900, 000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrierte labour, no problem for a country should be" left side by Michel Rocard, 1990, had said France "could not include the whole of poverty in the world."
One difference is the level of groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005, both from the right and from the left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent of the groβzügigkeit, one for immigrants is willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in his program on banalities that point out, partnership development, we want our 'migration problems to solve. "
This vision of immigration as a burden, as a problem, however, may affect the elections; it is economically costly.
As all the economists Ian aware of Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which summarises the latest findings on immigration, exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S., exists below the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the einwandererflut on economic growth, wages and jobs in the destination.
The limit immigration would deny and damage the employment market growth.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified to replaced, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that in fact the immigrants are much complementary than the local lohnarbeiter, as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors to the arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet.
The low skilled immigrants working in sectors, domestic lohnarbeiter put little charms, the higher quality among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the arbeitsangebot aligned.
Positive lohneffekt
A surgeon would have problems, as well as to work in a country, where there is a lack of anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants, so is a positive effect of einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic employment situation.
Giovanni peri, calculated in this way, a 1% -iger in the einwandererflut a miteinbezogene, long term increase in wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and is conducive to the economic growth - a high proportion naturalized immigrants from under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants.
The migrants also have net the systems, in European countries, on average for a total amount of 1% of the entire budget.
The weltarbeitsorganisation estimates, for example, that a einwandernde person the public budget to Germany at the age of 30 years on average, his life is a net contribution brings in revenue minus expenditure of about 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of schnittpunkte bring about "with the teeth."
This said teeth, which would shock the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now is to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, also a delicate thing.
Of the European continent should remind themselves, who after its invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the whole of the 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, the holocaustes Franco, of the Gulag, but also in Spain, salazars in Portugal and the supreme in Greece had put on.
No doubt some had thought it enough to exercise the right to vote, direktest on way to the triumph of the democracy on its enemies once and for all to see.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
The universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient condition and may well become "a unterdrückungsinstrument," as it was Republican philosopher Etienne vacherot said.
No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation that separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social spirit that jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost political and crisis of democracy.
The change of attitude of the Greek wahr-falsch-referendums had twice insightful character in this respect: even the need for a strong return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of disturbing sense of the impossibility of their unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
Truth is, that have shifted the front lines of the Democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer are moving in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, to push for success of the national referendum, which depending on the needs and perverse order has been organised.
A freischein for European absolute or a leap with the eyes in the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the nationals.
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective responsibility, quite rightly, clear and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know the rest of not even more, where the list to end - there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from his impotence and solidaritätsmangel.
It is the whole of Europe, it is humiliated at international level.
They are worried about souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so each of the angegliederten Nations him.
The urgency is that the sovereignty to give back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located on the set, whether the Europeans, to reduce the burden of their debts and looking at a future investment can open markets.
The exit from the crisis at European level decisions on the condition, which can not be taken without total democratic rechtmäβigkeit, without quite sure to destruction.
After this proposal has been fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time about, is this any European economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy - how the citizens want - to would be folly and further deadlock again.
We need to take a new stage of European integration.
In France, in the Republic of being, it took the fact that republicans to "create."
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form an integrated Europe better on the economic level.
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe creates a truly European sovereignty.
We need to create Europeans to Europe.
"kontaktlose" smart cards to the common good
The weltmesse for smart cards opens its doors on Tuesday in villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
The year 2011, according to eurosmart actually with a 11% rise in global sales of mikroprozessorchips - ec-karten, sim-karten-telefon - end, with more than 6 billion units sold.
The tragendste segment is the kontaktlose technology, which allows payments on public transport or settling of purchases, Quite simply by the card to lesegerät holds.
Sold to the one year before 320 million should be sold worldwide this year, kontaktlose 460 million smart cards.
Its market share should be in 2012 - 580 million units expected - and continue to grow more than 10% of the global chipkartenmarktes - 6,925 million cards - represent.
Europe wins as contactless payment to the ground after the region for a long time asien-pazifik hinterhergehinkt.
Some 26 million visa-karten are already equipped with this functionality, and 75 000 zahlungsterminals accept this.
In France the beginnings rather modest: only 400,000 kontaktlose visakarten were widespread.
However, the Consumer Markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore kontaktlose passport issued mastercards 2.5 million this year.
In order to move higher speed, it is now essential that the banks to provide customers with these cards.
"Two groβe French financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in the future kontaktlosem systematically bank cards auszuhändigen, the chip bestückt ', announces Gérard nébouy, Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of equipment is so far with the nfc-technologie necessary to implementation of these transactions as near field communication equipped.
"They are falling behind."
"But they should at least get a real trend next year."
"We expect in 2012, with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, chairman of eurosmart.
However, the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced the launch of one of testlaufes in selected yesterday, will be from December until next June.
The iphones of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a kapsel, allowing the kontaktlose payment.
The bpce has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also prepare the Société Générale had testified, the launching of a bidder yesterday to allow their customers kontaktlose payment by mobile phone.
Terroristenfront understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect boko Haram worried.
Long under suspicion the relations between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - aqmi - and the Nigerian sect boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian vize-auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel itself acknowledges that Algiers now have become "certainty" about this.
"The way that proceed with both organizations, as well as the relationship between the intelligence Services indicate a clear cooperation," without going into further detail, he said.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger, that last January interfaces to light.
In a restaurant in the Niamey by supporters of the aqmi should gekidnappten Antoine de léocour and Vincent delory on successive days at the same time as several of its kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want in the rubble at the site have found several telefonchips which the terrorists belonged.
Terroristenachse
Leads to several interlocutors, which conducted the analysis of the telephone calls in Mali, Niger and Nigeria are stationed.
According to Radio France Internationale - RFI - like the investigators, in particular the numbers of two partners: a number, Nigerians, for a long time in MAIDUGURI, a city in Northern Nigeria, the birthplace of boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who, when the aqmi and so close to the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must await clearer evidence, of course, before an operational cooperation between aqmi and boko harem can speak."
"But it is possible."
"You know, for years that the sect financial and intellectual support auβen, and does that is becoming increasingly active," reduces the Nigerian researchers Kunle amuwo.
Over the last few months are these "assistance" become increasingly evident in the process, as well as the speeches and the operationsmodi boko harem, which now include the suicide bombers, as well as the use of always carry complexity of explosives suggest, the same mark as those that have been used by aqmi.
The international community has to start in Washington, since then put pressure on Abuja to it for the boko problems caused Haram are taken into account.
The Nigerian authorities have the group, in fact, considered as a community of illuminaten long time, no special attention must be paid.
Faster success
In the 2002 in MAIDUGURI environment to a mosque, a school and boko founded the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - in haoussa Haram represents so much as "Western education is a disgrace" - is the establishment of an Islamic emirats in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region receives the merger rapid success.
They politicized and strict adherence to Sharia law, while their angegliederten activists used in the fight against the godless government.
The activists first churches, bars and authorities of the sights.
2009 showed the activists of boko increase with their attacks against the kommissariate Haram particularly active.
The reaction from Abuja, however, is indifferenziert as usual.
The army surrounded the town, it has 800 deaths.
The ITS Mohammed Yusuf in captivity will be killed in prison.
As a result, leaving the sect Increasingly radical and their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, they are known to an attack in Jos, the 80 deaths, then to another in Abuja.
In June, boko the fault of a selbstmordattentates Haram allocated in the secure polizeihauptquartier occurred in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations, a top international targets.
The creation of a terroristenachse in Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria after Somalia since all concerned should lead security.
Has occupied during the aqmi Mali and Niger, the Somalis by Al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, boko seems harem a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week during a hatta Alain Juppé gespräches with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria boko harem warned and prepared "to inform all indications."
The world gemäβ Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalisieren simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and support for Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America complex world with simple, not to say: simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters of their donnernden declarations and statements on the auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, repeatedly reported.
On China, Iran and the israel-hilfe fall - often in no way has underpinned - slogans.
Of the about the appointment of the "Grand old party" can Mitt Romney threatened the most valued Chinese quote to the WTO, and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in America, by the exodus of entire industries to Asia to äuβerste gereizt - accuse.
Gone stupid if this should lead to the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama, and one candidate who seems to have a mature vision of auβenpolitik, has nearly about his emotions schmeichelnden conduct of the air abgeschnürt.
He had called for a robust but constructive gesprächsaustausch with Beijing - also Obama's current position.
But Huntsman will not heard, because in the depths of the opinion polls, he stops.
Reagan's image
Romney also had military strikes against Iran, if the sanctions to stoppung praised the nuklearprogrammes should fail.
"If I am elected, areas I had the Iran stop," he getönt.
"Obama is reelected, you get the Bomb."
Auβerdem, he has promised to help Israel increased military and Obama accused commitments to have been guilty of this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain zweithöchst platzierter candidate, is itself a shameful aktenunkenntnis for show.
Recently he called for, to give the Chinese militärbedrohung versus that Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear" - and seemed auβer account of the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military atomarwaffen.
The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, äuβert itself, to be prepared, in Mexico against drug cartels in the American army service.
Obama the 2009 banned use of foltermaβnahmen to mutmaβlichen terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current präsidentschaftskontrahenten to Reagan, too, was simple ideas and had nevertheless won the Cold War.
They call in the memory, that Obama was selbstein amateur and water had to pay on the subject of anti-terrorist was in his wine.
You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve, zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "Boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he also moved the reputation of the weakness.
But this anfeindung is not quite so ungezwungen.
The population estimates more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, bin Laden has eliminated.
Since the Iraq you not military intervention, which lead to reduced.
And Obama surprised by adequate, he argues that America should be rebuilt economically, to new life to his leadership.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gasriese Gazprom wanted to make this event with glamour and Gloria.
Loaded more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, orchesterbeschallung and feinschmeckerbuffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly.
Mrs Merkel the German Chancellor, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister, François Fillon, and his counterpart mark rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together the steering wheel of the ventils films, which Russian gas transported to Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first of 1.224 km pipeline, linking the St. Petersburg region with Pomerania, delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, a gesamtlieferung from 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total - allowed, should be completed in the end of 2012.
And it is already the eventuality of the construction of a third leadership to distance ourselves full capacity.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge bauwerkes as a victory.
The project has been highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in order to prevent any trassenverlaufs through third countries - Poland or Ukraine on the land transit.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of its power, it will now be more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia to contract by threatening access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen Pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, to compare the occupation of Poland in the years 1939.
This means that the subject of äuβerst politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
This, however, at the expense of entkräftung European energy, because the project has beaten a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has it ready in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gasverbrauche and their gas tend to go through.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterie that unites us in organic way," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gasverträge are also important from a political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gazprom-manager in lubmin many on the gaszuleitung.
The construction of the gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The unterwasserleitung consists of steel with betonummantelung to protect them from schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in roughly 200 metres deep.
Their construction needed to datierenden minefields be avoided from the Second World War.
"around there were hundreds of mines had to be cautiously removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, Nord Stream, spokesman of the society.
Auβerdem increased maβnahmen had to be taken to protect the flora and fauna.
The line is a long queue of metal, eiffeltürme difficult as 242, which is more than the entire length interrupted by nothing: neither by outlets, wartungsstationen.
A kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden is planned, but the project developers distance yourself from it, as the Swedes have little were keen, a Russian staatsgesellschaft in a permanent way to size of their coasts to settle.
"In the event of an accident contract we gasdurchlass, Jens refined Müller in less than one minute."
In the event of a leak entweicht the gas in the air that is in the pipeline.
This case is konstrukteuren than just considered unlikely, however, as the schweiβnähte was estimated at a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.
Monitoring by the state of the pipeline will be guaranteed by a unterwasser-roboter to external observationszwecken seeschiff frame, as well as by circulating a device in the heart of the gas pipeline.
It has the form of zigarre, miβt introduced a metre diameter, the home of the pipeline and moved on from the gasdruck.
After three full days of movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, is the device in his arrival of detailed information on possible deformationen of metal.
The pipeline was designed to work for 50 years, without the slightest to undergo repairs.
The gaszirkulation will simply guaranteed under pressure.
This is 200 bar in the zutritts- 100 bar in the austrittsstelle.
Five companies combine their efforts to implement this project.
The leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Here the German companies are also attached to E. on and BASF, as ever, be 15,5%, as well as the Dutch gasunie and the French firmengruppe GDF Suez - ever to 9%.
These five companies have formed an unternehmensgemeinschaft, called the Nord Stream and which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It also has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.
Then this society the entire capacity of their gastransportes Gazprom has hired out together on renewable zwanzig-jahres-vertrag.
"Gazprom will pay for the capacity, regardless of how groβ real transportiere, Jens refined Müller is gasmenge."
The financing of the gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and to 70% covered by bank loans.
The cost of Labour as a whole should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability has been transferred.
The gas pipeline is on a sandy, with kiefern wooded küstenstrich lubmin from the Baltic Sea to light.
The 4.5 metres high are the gasaustrittspforte outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, before this is conveyed in the German gasfernleitungen who arrive.
Since last Tuesday of the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per verstreichende hour.
At full capacity it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a markennotizbuch.
Created by an Italian company about 15 years ago, moleskine would like to restore new style to the letter.
It has a flair adventure in kerzenschein zugebrachte hours with the letter.
The notizbuch of moleskine is easily visible again, with its black, rechteckigen cover his elastic, the eierschalfarbenen sides, such as the time aged.
The moleskine notizbuch, as we know it today is, however, created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, was a distinguiertes decided designnotizbuch on the market.
Maria sebregondi, then fachberaterin of the company, is charged with the launching of the new product.
The notizbuch has been a traditional production technology, called mole skin as maulwurfshaut, which described a baumwollack, inspired by, for example, will be used for polsterbänken salary.
This type of notizbuch was much in demand among writers and travellers.
"moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten the subject as icon avantgardistischer, until the 20th century artists," Maria sebregondi explained, was now markenverantwortliche In modo Modo.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish a paragraph of 12.7 million slice.
This is far removed from the usual production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 notizbücher were designed.
The Italian border, and moleskine happens said in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantombild of buyers since the notizbuch, businessmen, as well as students and professionals enthusiastically.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and offengeistiger customers.
The small, Italian companies, which was in its infancy 12 staff, today employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributing its notizbücher in bookshops in internetportalen as Fnac, small boutiquen enforce the town centre and understands that his identity.
"We have followed the spirit and his new schreibbedarf, despite the recovery of the emails," said Maria sebregondi.
This cultural charakterzug will be accompanied by the development of the company moleskine: recently, the brand launched a exposure called "detour Mr detour ', the architects and artists their own notizbücher ausstellten.
In August, the company at the Film Festival in Locarno also cover with leopardenmuster on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and showed it to diversify its products: bags, diary, pen, computerhüllen... the brand has the full range of articles.
A success, the neider puts on the plan: in the autumn of 2006 was Modo Modo of investmentfond SG capital Europe, the syntegra capital bought today, and suggested that a new chapter in the history of the company moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate remains disabled professionals at such high levels?
About 19% of disabled people to search for a job.
Today, the 15th week of the work for the disabled. "
Despite a determined öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has been twice as high as the average average: arbeitlosigkeit 19% to 9% of the population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric stressed Blanchet, Director General of the Association of adapt, the" week of work for the disabled "liberal."
"The progress made in 15 years are considerable."
"Then twice, but three times the rate of unemployment was not as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to be done."
It has to be said, however, that for disabled unemployed continue to exist many obstacles before they get a job.
Often it is the Elderly: 37% are older than 50 years - 17% on average.
You have a low level of skill: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment.
Finally, the unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled from 38% in gesamtschnitt.
In short, there are so many criteria, a new arbeitseinstieg difficult, and the "heart of the problem," said Christian grapin, Director General of tremplin, a group founded in 1992, is to help the company recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Is the unspoken, the mentalities, certainly, but slowly develop.
In April, a study carried out by the Association of ims-entreprendre for the magazine La Cité, the managers surveyed have had "a bit of kenntnisniveau with disabled," the "in" is "payable by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually minderbemittelten."
Result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the anstellungsziel of 6% disabled workers, which has been enshrined in law from 1987 to achieve.
The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3%," Pierre Blanc, Director General of AGEFIPH reported that the organization, which it is to collect contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof is that the number of "charges zahlender 'plants, as well as the amount of personal amounts between 2007 and 2011, and zahlenmäβig 59.000 reduced to 46.000 - and 606 to 480 million euros.
"The 2005 law, which provides for employed, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real insight in the groβen firmengruppen expressed."
According to the Ministry of work employ only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 staff against 82%.
Hazard: "What kind of happiness"
Even before they did the 'Blue dienstagabenden - 20:45 p.m. - the nerve, Eden, hazard and Georges leekens taken over her pleasure, which had brought the freundschaftsspiel, not covering them.
It would be far resorted to conceal claim that this was a connivance between them, but the image of symbolic speaks volumes.
Side by side on the zuschauerpodium of stade de France scenes, George leekens and Eden, hazard well taken over and would like peace contract.
Five months after the temperamentvollen gesture of his angriffsspielers against Turkey, the Belgian nationaltrainer had nothing but praise on his person harvested.
"I am very satisfied with Eden,, taken over his progress, and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the native liller itself.
With regard to the contrast between his presentation in the club and nationalelf "It is an entity that justifies everything."
"in Lille, I am over the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the launch."
Hazard will come after Saint-Denis freitagabend achieved against Romania on the matchs against France, in order for "shine."
But without the complaint from the "pleasure" to stop.
