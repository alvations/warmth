Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament       today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment   section of the Penal Code     which     condemnation of the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko    .
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia disadvantage for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas.
The decision is not yet final, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to review in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West have cast doubts on the impartiality of the Court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code which convicted the former Prime Minister was backed by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval is required 226 votes.
The victory of Libya
The history of the liberation of Libya, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi from was buried in a secret location in the desert, and without it there is no longer any war.
It remains to determine who is the winner
As is usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but it is now a question of whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has done to enter into force customary law, sharia law, which already somewhat familiar.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves were cut off the hand.
Women already can be forgetting to emancipate and apostates awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, consisting of warlike tribes, will join in the Koran.
In Libya will establish an order that we can not even imagine, and they certainly can not.
However, our way of life is neither the sole nor objectively the best and probably did not suit them, instead, to the Libyans already mentioned.
The fact is that it is not surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of dogs infidels.
The only justification was that, in his view, the attacks of NATO not led an American general, but large Allah, whose greatness held after each of the successful interventions.
When you pick winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a firefight which is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not militarily occupy Libya.
In this case, you will not be a problem to expel the "Crusaders"
But, without occupation will get the oil to grab the black gold in Libya with just fine words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can boast to protect human rights.
Whenever the followers of Sharia law are not cross.

Daily menus of an obese child: not desayuna and dinner sausage
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 years are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.
Obese children are mostly from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
It becomes to show the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the individual, as well as the models of reference.
In the table, obsessive children feed, for example, sausage at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of the obese had dined chips on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children, there is no tradition of sports, which is applicable to the majority of families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, found time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the programme of "obesity is not a coincidence," which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
Until now, they have participated in the project over 12 000 children from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and exercise in family are determining factors that make a marked decrease in the number of overweight children and even obesity.
"only half of all children surveyed have responded with five daily meals as the regime: breakfast, lunch, dinner, lunch and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, are also important details, which also include, for example, have a fixed time for breakfast in family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In the majority of families, desayuna each alone.
But the worst was to discover that in 10% of households are not desayuna nothing.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are consumed with much more often unhealthy chips.
Almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drink daily soft drinks, sweets (70%).
As a general rule make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this outcome will be reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Makes you your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the elected chavales (172 204 boys and girls of 13 colleges) are creating their own allowances from all offers potential according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among his favourite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is particularly disturbing the popularity of soft drinks, sweets," it warns in the final report of the study.
As the main meal takes the biscuit pasta and follows closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject the pulse and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the information just.
"in the control group of participants in the study who completed the questionnaire after the prevention programme" obesity is not a coincidence, "was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating," he said in the results of the study.
Draws attention, for example, with regard to the soft drinks, sweets, where many children begin to prefer the normal water and flow.
Children also elect more often in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of fresh food and derivatives of flour.
The stylist also has to be a good psychologist, maintain professionals
In the chapeau article, how they learn the stylists, because I complained a bit of that initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how to run things.
Conferences of three professionals, how to dress characters problematic and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer they are final exams, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the Director, Alena (in no man) on how to dress women who do not have a perfect symmetry.
And that is the great majority.
Someone cuellicorto is, somebody has a stylized without adequate curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist has to know about shoulders relaxed optically gauges, drag a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, breasts and hips enormous but waist close and at the same time I do not dress the too defiant
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers are not adapted, can be stitched together at least an extra piece of cloth to measure.
Certainly not repent, because the clothes that feel perfectly is unaffordable.
With a skirt to measure will feel much better than with a not for moving, lifted, danced in the waist, etc.
The body can allow stylized clothes with folds, trimmings and embroidery or drapeados.
There are certainly many types of information and various bodies, so I am glad to have the whole week in order to put my head all this information.
Even so, I fear that the task, because I have more than well.
Each participant in the workshop was assigned two famous, that he will have to design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night.
We must take into account the current aspect, the fashionable style to suit the individual in question.
I won "dress" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you speak of the campaign of Victoria Secret.
Cry from the inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who lately have fattened around 100 kilos (please, take into account the overstatement), or jovencísima Selena Gomez. '
The clothes have to cut from magazines or search the internet and print, and then develop graphically.
It is as moodboard, which called for the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think in the part of the graphic styling.
The stylist, therefore, is not only physically, but is also involved, for example, of the pages of products in the magazines (of specific items, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
It told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all that is already on the Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three guests specialists inspired the Conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza POKORNÝ, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to capitalise on this.
And a good stylist knows to work with the same piece of clothing in various ways.
The variability is, in this case, essential.
As well as gabardina (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be a classic clothing with jeans and T-shirt, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacón shoes and photograph it as if it were in fact a dress.
Or well enough to roll up our sleeves and get the neck for a totally different picture.
"Jugad with this," we insisted.
What we value most is the following advice: "to start work, first may know all the rules."
"then we can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I was clear why memorizamos all those formulas, which combines with what, why, then, is that in the fashion magazines are different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve of which aims to photograph.
Well, for a history of fashion that takes ten pages, therefore, outfits (10), we must be prepared, ready to use at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of which are different from those used in the reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing outfit the.
Honza POKORNÝ assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary Singer, but the image márquetin and have made her a Global Star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear trend to use the services of the stylists.
Even the famous people also are useless (I am enough my abilities, my physical appearance is not so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely to indicate a height very different from yours real (minor).
Then there is just guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist was not enough focus on fashion, but we must understand of outfit.
During his work, especially should be communicated with the people that dresses, which is why it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows the people, not less, defends his views.
"when a Director os recruits for clasifiquéis clothing and apparel completéis with fine, you can not catch and throw everything and say:" Oh What horror. "
"Encontrad at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend to anyone they can get," said Mario.
He also showed us that everything should be on the so-called "placovka", i.e., the job market.
This is set around the waist and they are there all the necessary tools.
They are objects like scissors, scissors, or like quitapelusas imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the meeting of photos of products such as handbags or hats), special clamps lure of clothes ahead, if this were increased (the very weak and other connections are not permitted, because it could damage the fabric), or a game of sewing.
For we are not left in the passive listening and put something in practice, we have learned to take the usually of shoes.
Even during the meetings of photos in the study, in a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more still outside.
And we did not do more to come in and take.
We could not touch the shoes with scissors in order not to damage by accident.
So we had to be very clever.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.
The truth is that it does not give me very well these skills.
This is just a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realised that devote myself to the styling at professional level is not a bed of roses, but I get exactly like what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run will compete across America.
Overview
A carefree travel, in principle, is complicated because of a series of careless talk of a routine trip during the next morning.
To some extent they managed to meet the expectations, but it serves no purpose, if, in fact, was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, awakened great expectations before its premiere.
It promised to provide oxygen to the old saga of racing Need for Speed and, upon shown, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on their own feet.
As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results do not vary much about what we expected.
There are races that can be taken by acceptable, but the total lost points because of absurd rulings, which have already appeared on the series for years.
In reality can not be called mistakes, but rather the unwillingness of incomprehensible programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
Ye introduces a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to resolve, it offers participating in an illegal race across America.
Os sentáis at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first in New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then, in more than 50 races.
It follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you do not have anything like the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary.
But the walk across the desert landscape, the seasonal or high mountains covered in snow produce a very pleasant visual impact.
In addition, the races diversify from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert os encontráis a sandstorm reduced visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains should beware lest Ye Mr Tortora himself an avalanche.
According to that, every one of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.
For a time, trying to beat a number of rivals required (normal in a classic race), after trying to gain time (classic duel timed) and then you looked a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, but that does not make things even further.
The novelty is the landscape outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented as Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always clicking the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be upset and, in the aforementioned context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The model of leadership follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.
That means that already today is not a great thing, but it can not be said to be bad.
If buscáis a realistic simulation, because you can look elsewhere.
But in a race designed with enough action is quite this style of leadership, although we can find something better between Games of the competition.
So far, so good.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of the models of leadership, the same is not true for collisions.
Games of this kind can not expect recreated deformities and complicated collisions, but in fact before a coup against any object, you can not predict how your car, not everything is in order.
It is typical that, to make a very tight overtaking or move the car with a normal traffic, has only slight friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car is just doing gymnastics got out of control.
Or even just totally destroyed.
Thanks to the system of reseteo, no major problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Those are programmed reseteos so that when you suffer an accident or salts of the runway, the game te restores to rescue the last point on the runway.
However, in each race reseteos only has five available.
If the, consumís all need to restart the race from the start.
Thus it is no more than a help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, the only help reseteo aid, learning the given phase of memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, we need to go in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times os encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilians" always with the same configuration, although you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes before or after.
This makes rage, especially in situations when you see that two cars are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent premises without problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either slow.
It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the "surprise" always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game llegaréis at sites, without taking into account the time, you always advance the same opponent at the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more striking.
Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost.
When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of cars that come from the front, so that you can make porridge at the start of the car.
One can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you straight away.
And it is a pity, because although the model of the voyage is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to continue to detail what happens or where.
And it is truly equal, if the credit is carried the idea with fifty exclusive leads or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it is going to have to change their car, but in the vast majority of cases os is what you get.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for motorways and superdeportivos exotic straight for a technical leadership, for example, by winding mountain roads.
Besides narrative thread lead is also a thread of parallel challenges, i.e., there are careers in specific locations to be known by the stories.
Here conseguiréis not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as tales.
To reach the upper level, the driver was open several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is a role Autolog connected online, which compare your results with those of other players and disponibiliza other Community functions.
One of the most difficult to understand how this is done the last race in history.
With the car arrived until the subway tunnel (pass), where os ponéis run dark lanes (pass).
The speedometer os marks between 150 and 200 km / h (pass), and suddenly you come from behind the convoy of the subway and ye leads ahead without further.
In the language we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors of truth is taken by a bunch of stupid.
The technical side of the game is not unusual, but at least the general visual effects are in the majority of cases pleasant, sometimes so impressive.
Because it is a shame that, in the most tense moments reduces the quality of image and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This particularly affects the accidents where there are involved many participants, when the quality of continuous view is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to make it palatable to the bulk of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but it can be assumed that nobody would buy the game only for his music.
The final sense of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoids absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have problems in asserting that The Run is the best game of NFS of recent years.
This gives the impression that the game is not over.
The fun is insured, but ready because the mistakes you attack in the eyes with the force of some floodlights of airport.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptics.
"the Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions."
"I did not expect to be montase an all-out war."
"the last five, six years ago, before the situation will be stabilized somewhat, calming and new players are accustomed to their new roles," it began its conference at the Faculty of Law, the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How does not take seriously its slogan "clearly and openly about Europe," he said in the first part of its Conference, when it managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, that would be the envy of many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also balanced the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"First comes the criticism, if it is a dull, grey official, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left everyone perplexed, because their roles for perfection."
"He is a man that you can listen to the members of the 27 States, to communicate with them, and which has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy explained to the question: "who is this EU? What number can draw?" It is an important step towards unifying and clarifying the political union of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban the cheese of Olomouc
Vicenová has also worked on the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, resolved the crisis of the gas and hosted a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the Government at the time were identified as a highly negative aspect, which were heavily affected by the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.
In the words of the Ambassador: "a good fuss", not just the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled its main slogans, which arrived in Europe: "about Europe with clarity."
"The truth is that I do not like the Ugly abbreviations, extranjerismos or jargon that people do not understand."
"How can a citizen understand that Brussels was not invented of truth cucumbers curved cucumbers, bananas or round of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban the cheese of Olomouc?".
It aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and to bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We hoped the Europe of the speeds
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive rather negative aspects that the positive.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
This is the fault of a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, highlighted the strength and the collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"believe me that when they come to me a Pole and a Hungarian and me as a Slovak, a French at my side, I said:" What you have been, already, of the Visegrad Group? ", and she did not do him no mercy."
In the future, the EU, as Vicenová, faces new regulations unforgiving of budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "the European Federation."
"We need countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"He said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and not to be left out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and reinforce the two-speed Europe", it is hoped Vicenová.
In this sense, it also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the entirety of the EU should be discussed among Member States, not just between the members of the eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence
If someone to seek an end to define precisely the strategy of IBM, the closer it would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its inception.
The basis of this nature largoplacista was the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to believe.
Its slogan "Think!" became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future giant, was also the title of an internal newsletter that IBM launched in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of an enterprise culture carefully lifted.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered over 100 years for that reason, because he stuck to its basic principles, but without fear about the changes.
This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century, "said during its anniversary, the current director of the company, Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was worried about the care of their employees as the operator of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators were paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewards the best inventors and sellers.
The same sophistication long-term maintains IBM in the relationship with the client.
Since the beginning, the company failed to identify talent (to be one of the first companies in the world to end discrimination of any kind, could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, Palmisano to replace the next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has worked 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, rain of ideas in line, which would provide a myriad of future strategies and innovations.
Not surprisingly for ideas, as in the signature work almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.
"from the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company," says the economist, a professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology," said George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company itself said there is a difference between going into the business and set up a business.
IBM - or "the Great Green" - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become the last 100 years in one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both teams as programs, services and infrastructure accommodation website within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
Has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among their inventions are the ATM, payment cards, swaps, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM billed this year 220 billion. This year has become the second signature technology by market capitalisation (the first Apple), when it exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just meet the taste of customers and the time (IBM did not bid for its own operating system, OS/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
"If your business is based in advance, can not be emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and equally, if they do not work, the leaves).
And this difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In a matter of sales, IBM focuses primarily on services, which are approximately one-fifth of programmes and a fifth of teams.
Still, in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of 15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology of the future.
The investments have continued since 2008, when we first expressed the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts according to the tenets of its first Chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that so far the IBM has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM since the start of the year 2008 has grown estratosféricamente until 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
The currency of IBM is to change everything, except its value.
It can therefore expect that when the next crisis, this giant flexible tolerate.
IBM History: since the lawnmower cheese until space flight
The International Business Machines (IBM) was founded in New York over a hundred years, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in the year 1924 - originally, this was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis which resulted in the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies that date back to the 1880's.
He owned inventions like the famous "watch out", to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its Supervisory Board.
Flint file on the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to assist with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the bedrock on which underpin the corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, since cutting of meat and cheese until tills.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the turnover doubled over 9 million and began the vast expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company, almost forty years after taking the Chair of the head, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr..
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to charter flights to the space (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
The classic "pecés", which introduced the standard computers of that time, reaching the market under the name of the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, became part of the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to offer a comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e., "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned areas or improved circumstances, for example, in terms of transport and the administration of cities.
For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows retailers to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932, opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ČR operates along the strategic focus of outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe have is in Prague. Here, too, there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
About her unfaithful husband Rychtářová:
I Iveta, stay in that ass, that we do not want that!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said that is over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef woke up from his sleep pink and return home.
However, it is not going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer Bartošové at home, could not imagine how to end their marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not budged thirty days after Říčany and Pepe left to the singer.
So publicly declared that he loved.
With time, Darina resigned itself, apparently accepted the relationship of her husband and even left him forever.
At Rychytář does not care who goes to bed with his wife.
If one day Rychtář break with Bartošová, his wife is not expected at home with open arms.
It is the biological father of my children and, if you want to live the rest of his life in our House, nobody will miss him. "
"But living here not as my dear old borrico that was wrong, but as a man I link certain ties," said Rychtářová and added that it had already been desenganchado of her husband and insisting only on mutual respect.
By Josef hitherto does not care that woman has closed the back door.
"I accept the decision of my wife."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change as possible."
"My wife has established this as a marriage on the role and I respect that."
"the company remains in force, make arrangements for home care, the Garden, the home, make purchases."
"Darina and I speak with normal, the only thing is that we do not share a bed, Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"do not sleep together and it does not interest me, nor Whither or if you have a boyfriend.
I know that it is my fault, I enamoré of Iveta and assume full responsibility, "concludes Josef.
The worst defects of women: do you also refer to you?
If pedís men who are able to cite some typical vices of women, in general, each appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize in the following lines, citing certain female defects that can make the blood boil for boys?
Shop
Do you blame your average orange of dependence on shopping?
Do you have to purchase at least trapito in a week?
Would you like to buy often in rebates?
Then, in his case, it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease his passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see what woman could resist the temptation to walk without further by clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and then test them all in the ideally probador (in all different colours)?
But for most women go shopping as a pastime, men can be converted into a virtual hell.
Just remember how many times already told her partner that better wait in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too fat?"
"need to slim at least five kilos - should begin to do exercise?"
"Do you really happy?"
Does not it sound these phrases?
Is that it?
It is one of these women obsessed by their appearance.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner complain all the time of their physical appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the further increases the frequency of complaints, most embarrassing become women.
The order and cleanliness in the first place
It is like a merry-go-round infinity.
Clean the windows, turn the vacuum, mopping the floor, brushing the dust, mopping the bath and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner that you have stepped on the clean soil with a dirty foot, their children have daubed a newly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that both struggled to clean?
If you experience this "diversion", proved to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that the order and cleanliness probably should not have to be paramount in the family.
This desire harmless cleaners could threaten their relationships and family well-being.
Making unpleasant remarks
"The underpants used are left with the dirty linen."
"you want to get these socks used also tomorrow."
"The damp rag is not left on the floor!"
If these comments to a couple more times a day, knowing that they will take it out of their cells.
Of course, you do not want to say anything bad, just wants to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if they knew that men, women, for its part, would not do much commentary.
Libel and gossip
Some women are also the slander, the gossip, but also the offences and conspiracy against someone.
Women are concentrated in relations, so I like to talk boards of things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps to each one of us is sometimes escapes a small and harmless machine.
With hand on heart, that is very nearly all women.
On the other hand, there are women that chismosas such unchecked, who love chismorrear and so often, despise all and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female labour force.
Jágr Voráček and helped with attendances to beat the Philadelphia
The STRIKER hockey Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday at the meeting of NHL with two attendances that brought victory over the Philadelphia 5:3 on the field of Carolina and returned to the Czech players in the vanguard of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took the move of the Star of 39 years, and took a step further and was declared the best player in the game.
It awarded two attendances in the party, and also the companion of Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told journalists overseas Giroux had predicted a great night.
"even before the match had told him that he would make triplete."
"I was very much aware of it."
"sometimes seem ambushes," explained Jágr, after his performance would give a goal for Giroux, following the first of Flyers trallazo the.
A while later, also the second intervention of the Czech team had a trail.
Voráček was done with the disk behind the goal of Hurricanes' and moved between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who got goals.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part as Flyers dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase by the fourth of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I do not want to say who is the best player on the pitch, but was certainly among the best three," balanced Jágr at its plant.
"It never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I am very happy about this."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the game NHL, my colleagues for me, and it now produces results, "Jágr adds.
Carolina still turned the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, of penalty, to be a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, but eventually outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"cleared the disk, I picked up speed and Read went towards the furthest part."
"I tried to atinar to the disk and I am happy because we won," Voráček described the final goal of the match as lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, not played until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second quarter withdrew with an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defence, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to capitalize on one of the shots.
Rather than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injuries in the last row, and play the game with just five defenses.
"This is bad."
"We play the game with just a veteran player, the rest were novice."
"In the end, but it is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Both rotate players turned against us, we could not resist."
"We had to simplify further the game, lifting the disk of our countryside."
"and so we leave gaps," explained one of the defences, P. K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
The goals of Jets were marked by five players who put and end to a series of defeats that already lasted five parties.
How have evolved prices for travel since 1989.
Until 1989 in the then Czechoslovakia had only five travel agencies authorized Čedok: State, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies from that time sold in the majority of cases travel only to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.
The Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime was inclined towards the West and travel of tourists Czechs were then rather restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (or also Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel alone, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should be put to the tail with a Sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the Agency.
Yet not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the people "politically unreliable", that it could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (currency West) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, which had a large number of huts and houses of summer, the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The mode of travel of the Czechs has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.
Whereas until 1989 for us was the most will not spend their holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs were 4.5 million holiday travel to countries around the world.
It is the great paradox, nna today because we are not aware of the fact that the current favourite destination, Croatia, it was not until 1989 could travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s was imposed visa exemption for travel to neighbouring States of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially in Vienna or Germany.
The long checoeslovacos were not tired of the trips to the West, everybody wanted to see him at least for a time.
For example, in Paris sleeping groups of Czechs in parks in tents, as our income then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the carry with them, canned food (sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living, and also increased the average wages, what about 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increased demand for travel agencies began in 1997 with regularity, to prepare the travel using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly lower prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs travelling without a visa in almost all developed countries, except US, which further streamlined our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario happened back in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, every year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and hot. This winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The visit exotic countries currently nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our development pos-revolucionario, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US removed visas for Czech tourists, so that our country has become among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on foreign travel more than 15 000 CZK per head, including expenditure on the site of stay.
Regular General Assembly convened to elect the President, which could end up again in deadlock.
For nearly five months, the Czech football is without the President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Federation of Soccer Fačr (Czech), will not be known or after the convening of the forthcoming Extraordinary General Assembly, which will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, we can not even vote to choose between three candidates.
Stakeholders to chair the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned his post in June, but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person who knew deal of football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of the Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
It was revealed on 16 September when he had to be elected as the new President.
The General Assembly delegates met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the neighbourhood praguense of Smíchov, because the talks were blocked, and not only in terms of the method of choice.
No consensus was reached in terms of who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral Code remain open.
More light on the situation because he could not throw nor the Executive Committee, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of Fačr, which, from the direction of the Association, which represents the professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate with the greatest percentage of support in the Federation to which it will present its candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is ready to reach a compromise to win that candidate with a greater percentage of total votes in both federations.
The part Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winning percentage, according to these calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would disagree, however, the connection to the two previous rounds and negate the entire concept of bicameral system, 'Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, agrees also Tomaš Paclík, though it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates is in Pelta.
"I would like to see a vote in the full agreement with the statutes."
"so they do not invent any nonsense about the representatives at the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and directing his remarks primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new Chairman, and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively.
"All passions are apaciguarán with the Party today of our national team at the European Championship.
"football will again be a player, and it will cooperate more comfortable," said the Representative, Jablonice which of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not about the conflict between Bohemian and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules at their own convenience."
"This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope that common sense," said Rajchl.
Because there is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations took place in Montenegro, but who can know to start the game if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice-chairs Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not emerged this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee at the venue of the match of classification.
The decisive meeting Quizas, finally, could be the one to be held at the ministerial level, to be held this Wednesday.
By Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties split on the most powerful sports organization in the country for an agreement to be reached.
The stakes are high: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the next General Assembly of the central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport ČSTV) (try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the House of Sazka lotteries.
Paclík struggle to reach the Presidency, because it does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate to pay all their ideas on the new President of the Russian Football Fačr (Czech), nor is presented as a candidate for a post as relevant.
"if there's a good person, he would fight for it, and I would not run as a candidate in elections."
"But so far has not been able to find a person as well," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency ČTK) (
What motivates to enter the challenge Paclík with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility to block Pelta, the course winner of the elections, which opens the way for the chairmanship of the Federation Cup Fačr (Czech).
Paclík also points out that, if defeated, would remain in the Office of the President only until 2013, when they reached the turn of the general Assembly of hands.
In that capacity, he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too connected with the football events.
"I have already spoken to some people it might take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this time, do not even want to identify with the Czech football."
"I would like to change that vision," he adds.
What bothers supposedly more Paclík at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the Chairman of the Football Association Pilsen Regional Berbr Roman, a man with a controversial past, known outside the little world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general Assembly.
For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the Chair.
"If it wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change."
"with the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious football will draw even less benefit," said Paclík.
Also mentions the fact that a few years ago on behalf of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, Pelta went unpunished.
"I do not know what the prestige of football could bring the victory of Pelta."
"and we will look into the eyes with UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, which also takes some caution with his previous statement that "sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes President."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday Paclík could arise cooperation with Pelta in the future.
It is the view of another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly September ended in a fiasco.
"He Pelta () would be the first to be followed."
"It is very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."
"but not as manager of a partnership."
"I do not go the nose where I am not capable," added Paclík, which in September attracted much attention to support the suspension of the Commission of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Marcel, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that dare to manage the partnership.
Using their management capacities of private companies, since the summer, was also the Director of the Pilsen, with its support held in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the force to change some things in the area of football and contribute to their practice safe."
"to reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary Committee and appeal, causing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathy towards the President of the Daniel Křetínský Sparta.
One of the priorities also would be to strengthen the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee Fačr and, with the help of which exerts pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery.
"It is one of the key issues that should be the new President."
"If increased taxes on gaming, as advertised political parties, support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where you're going to stop all this money," he said.
Now, Paclík Ademas does not even take account of their association with the Club Pilsner, although he claims that the Chairman of the partisan Fačr must be "no".
In turn, Pelta is associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"But I see no connection to cede hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person, and then to return there after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta Fačr promised the new statutes to end the impasse of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the new statutes that Fačr have definitely serve to resolve, in the future, the disputes concerning the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec the is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections were not conducted in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and raise funds.
To participate in the last minute at the last general Assembly, so that this postponement of two months you could go either to defend and present, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.
"The people of all levels of football, it took a long time ago and is waiting to hear this Thursday at the new President."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the Association," thinks the man who is associated primarily with the Paris Club Jablonice, but who worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that existed in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the general Assembly June were adopted statutes that were not as perfect as we thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a President since September," warned Pelta.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.
"If I am elected President, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we can not exist," said Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, tries to stick with their opponents.
Already in the past had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would be its first Vice-President.
It took a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.
"for more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some success."
"their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"That is why many of them doubt about its true nature," he told his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.
Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football competitions, from the lowest to the highest.
The latter should be a showcase for the promotion of football.
"Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose because of Bohemians as the result of the corruption scandal last year."
"immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," said two months ago to the candidate ČTK 46 years.
Below also promised that his appointment as Chairman of the football does not imply any modification of the workforce.
"It would have to know the tasks of each employee," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable anxiety.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting before the next general Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday at Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, no doubt we will be able to overcome.
"football needs credibility, which will recover only if we finally have a leader," still two days before the day more decisive in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, the mood Fačr begin to work with.
If in the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as the new President of the Czech Football Association, a lot of people will probably be resentful.
Rajchl promised that, if elected, they would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and do that members of the Executive Committee are responsible for each area of football individually.
It also pledges to resolve the case of improving relations with Bohemians, UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work begun by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football."
"Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection via professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance."
"that is not to say that it would do everything alone," he said in an interview Rajchl ČTK for.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area."
"and I will give difficult tasks for football can, in each of these segments, proceed with great momentum."
"A lot of people that probably would not appreciate this, because they will begin to work very hard and not only to criticise the work of others," he added.
Owing to the atmosphere of criticism in the football Movement, said that he had considered the possibility of not to stand again as a candidate.
"everyone knows, that work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know that this makes sense and that there will be no people behind me and my dog to prevent every step," explained the reasons for his indecision.
"a lot of people told me that I should not give me up, because then they would give up too."
"It is important to have faith and not to abandon as well, without more," he said.
As they say, it motivates also continue the work already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, completed a large part of the work that I will not now be lost."
"there are processes that had begun and will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not want anyone to stop them," he announced concerned by the fact that, if elected to the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could return to be as it was before the era of Hašek.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"behind him is especially for all those people who are responsible for football to be just a privilege for a select few."
"I can hold a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I would like to make a football for all, because only then will feel well all and not just elected," said Rajchl.
It also rejects the idea that only serious Bohemian President.
"Although some people try to argue otherwise, I have in mind to do their utmost to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact of splitting the Second Division in a part in another Czech and Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division."
"It would not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young players," said Moravian Rajchl.
But at the heart of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, President of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in their ability to be elected.
"I still have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his deputy, and you know that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the savings of some tens of millions of kronor disadvantage of contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the Law of the lottery.
On the other hand, it recognizes its part of the blame for the Federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that "Pelta is disqualified to regain confidence in the Czech football," said another rival, Paclík, a strong candidate that it has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that did a great job in the Pilsen that year."
"In the case of the election, it will probably be what already started Ivan Hašek currency and not significantly the number of staff in the Committees."
"I do not want to use that in my favour," assesses their Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
Leap into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Swimming pools, from a point of incredible, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: who will visit Europe can live their blue marvel, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bathrooms bubbly.
A book shows where the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder conducted a fact-finding trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not fail in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.
He lay on his back on the water, watched the artistic dome on top, swimming towards the marble angels, which looked at the edge of the pool and asombraba before the pool deck modernist meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, noted in his book at the time of all interesting details on the style and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and introduced in his recent book "Badefreuden": pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, "concrete construction in Taunus."
His "journey by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom.
Wants nothing to do with sport, Meder said, only water is different.
Only if it annoys fans in the bathroom have to content themselves with blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear trinos blithe of birds in the park.
"one day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting fine pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The swimming pool chapoteo in the airy and oils in the sauna. The factor of well-being in swimming is so great because it covers all the senses, Meder.
And if the builder strives, swimming decks can be a real gift for the hearing: "instead of soil, in the bathroom is an area of water."
"On the one hand is transparent, moreover reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All doubles optically: the high vaults, the tiles of colours, the launch pads.
The book with photographs in format Badefreuden "small" provides in 190 pages of very interesting data on the architecture and art history in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly, one might be tempted to jump on the blue.
The collector of swimming pools, Meder discovers the copies in its investigations in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths in the bathroom of Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, waters with nitrates in a unique cavity kárstica (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some items, which are pools of alkaline waters and are in a building with a bottle (in Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény).
Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: while the entire city puts the eyes in the overhead pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow cover, since the swimming pool outside of a bathroom at St. antón, and in the Turkish bath: there is a window from which you can observe the practice in ski runs.
The design, perhaps, most extraordinary hopes to customers in Längenfeld: the Cathedral of water in Ötztal ovni just seems a landing in the Alps.
Three open source steam rises in winter, while substantive mountains of Ötztal stand in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
At Meder, the collector of swimming pools, he invaded the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur in the toilets of Árpád Békescsaba in Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that the people are believed to have arrived in a bathroom toilet.
The smell coming from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose loam is Hits the skin to enter into a swimming pool, a enjoyment of the welfare of a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in their pursuit of beautiful places for the bathroom, when they wanted to visit discovered swimming and sunbathing in the bathroom of Czech Luhatschowitz, was found with a blocked field.
The bathroom of 1902 of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the windows of the building modernist desmoronadas red, white and yellow, saw the bushes grow between the tiles.
The Decline countered in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Palace Termal in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind it; not only can you discover neorománicos in times of its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall style of Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palace Termal is the darling of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not just because it is a native of the Black Forest.
"There is great merit merging different architectural styles in a fantastic Unit Meder," says.
In a palace and immersion in the pool, SPA does not seem to have much importance.
Land speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials.
By Christian Teevs
Does Waiver Deutsche Bank to its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to test the impact of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculating in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claimed that Deutsche Bank and other lenders have withdrawn from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest countries in the world.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch is.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch is in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the stock exchanges of raw material price increases are global, and the banks saddled with the responsibility of the global problem of hunger.
The campaign of the Ombudsman is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar fashion.
Originally, bets on raw materials are thought to protect traders of price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and reap the profits of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism in a different way than the American competitors: promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the report of Foodwatch is.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then results will be presented to the Board of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the direction of the bank informed of the consequences.
At the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to repair its image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch is, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "bets on rising food prices show a particularly dramatic how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare."
Ackermann stands as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in its portfolio that could jeopardize the money for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"bothered if Ackermann is the subject of the people who are hungry or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the Chairman of the Board will change something different is not planned on the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.
And It hardly needs to import potential losses, that will address his successor.
Two thirds would rescind the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is striving to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the Organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the Survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments to bet food prices.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his Bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would rescind all investment of the money that comes from the land speculation.
The 43% advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent called upon reflection, cancel your account and change to another institution.
The house in Vienna 21
The flag moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958, he won prizes in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now reopened as a House of exhibitions.
The architecture of postgerra love modern forms, the clear glass halls curves brave and new construction materials, typical of the thought about technical progress, so that the flag of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the exhibition of 1958 Brussels is a good example and known.
The Pavilion Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered to present a milestone of contemporary architecture.
The well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition.
With his legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW over aplanado adjacent building in Munich, became internationally known.
Its flag, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station in the south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was dubbed the "House 20."
The building was good but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite that was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and increasingly lapses.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now called "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
The Tuesday afternoon opened the museum belvedere, who owns the House, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new Director of the gallery belvedere Austrian since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, Doctorate in art history with a significant career, among other things, patinadora artistic on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum Founder and Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Salzburg, undertook the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
With the exception of the contemporary art, described the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of Surrey, there should be a cafe and a bookshop and build an office building.
Strict budget under Control
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because amended significantly the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, and expanded it was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a "huge and important place", which included "almost every weekend" presentations.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms have major problems, the building was "an energy devorador Krischanitz," he said.
It changed the profile of the windows on the facade of glass, they installed an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass and replaced the glass ceiling by a special security glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and the roofs of asbestos was rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light declined between the House and the street lighting, provides a bridge serves to enter the building nearly new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
Stay the original exterior doors, the House is painted in shades of old mahogany and protected against the oxidation.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control on the part of the Office of monuments and a low budget.
"often had to find material that is good, cheap and also liked to the Office of the protection of monuments," says and warns of a soil Krischanitz harsh in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, challenges and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The flag that came from Brussels "has been difficult, recently said Krischanitz, a typical" casual appearance in the history of the city. "
An architecture that is "always in the wrong place," and that is why I wanted to "raise awareness".
In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, it was a stroke of luck town-planning. The completely new and planned "neighbourhood of the central Station", with homes and offices, lies alongside the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps succeeds another stroke of luck: the House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary Art Berlin and, as you hear, negotiated with the city on a neighbour in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a crisis package amounting to millions of winter
The company has devised a plan of crisis, avoiding the breakdown of the trains in winter.
It should double the number of staff.
It costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and train delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent on this year, more than 70 million euros, according to a newspaper report.
"The newspaper Bild reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the Group, planned investments until 2005, of a total of around 300 million euros.
So what should be better availability of vehicles and the rail network, even with a long pass.
Among other things, it plans to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The objective is to clear the snow and ice platforms for the operation and 90 per cent of the needles are necessary for the operation at the end of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, Chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, because, among other things, you failed reservations before adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains take years awaiting the authorization of the federal Railway.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the tracks of the high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the rupture of an axis in the central Station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the US.
After the tumult on the Chairman Josef Ackerman, a new problem for the US, Deutsche Bank must pay a fine deep pockets.
As if the problems were not enough for its past, Deutche Bank in the US acquired at the giant of the industry, the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement to end the disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It comes from the sale of mortgage securities.
The regulator NCUA financial markets criticizing many big banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks to the depths.
"We are happy to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the deference NCUA, held by the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration NCUA () is responsible for credit unions in the US and support in the event of bankruptcy to protect investments of customers.
The attempt to reintegrate NCUA caused the loss of millions.
The agreements are currently closed its first type.
The regulator also called accounts at other big banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of the dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, now a wind is blowing complicated for US banks.
Investors and inspection have engaged in countless processes to receive compensation or punish misdemeanours.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA (in) has produced the largest number of complaints.
He blames the 18 major international banks that the two American Government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the business of mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand for the business FHFA, it is worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection demands that the Institute of Frankfurt reply of "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invests heavily in the company of Information Technology, IBM.
Since March has acquired shares with a value of more than ten billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in companies of computers or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read the report trade of IBM and changed his view on investing in the sector.
Due to understand much earlier than IBM offers on all services and computer systems for the departments of Information Technologies of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as an honour.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett unveiled today in the broadcaster CNBC economy that has acquired IBM shares with a value of 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a participation rate of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM failed so far nothing of the commitment.
He praised the leadership who handled the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"they have done a brilliant job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time, the services of the Information Technology lucrative as the operation of centres of calculation.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said that only invests in companies whose business understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity in a freight train, a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns almost roughly 80 subsidiaries own, as well as part of a whole series of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81 years, took charge of the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in 60 and, with a wise investment, expanded to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
It is therefore an idol for countless investors around the world.
Its rapid and unerring sense to earn money has provided the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After the discovery of the investment from Buffett, the actions of IBM stock rose one percent.
"The giant Blue", as it is known, IBM has a stock market value of more than 220 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, does not work.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt the State of German law.
One newspaper spoke of a "bloody" ideology that returns to revive it.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern about this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that were thought to have died some time, since the attacks in the form of fires at Mölln in November 1992 and attack in Solingen in May 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned for Germany to have xenophobia.
The right-wing network discovery reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not far from predictable.
"Do you returned to reignite the bloody ideology?", entitled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk. ""
The newspaper Sabah "stresses that, on the contrary, one of the authors of the crime was an informant to the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist morass.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German politicians and Turks reflected in a solemn ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German Turk agreement.
The coexistence came on the scene with gaudy colours, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," said the title of an article in the Turkish platform internet "Have X", referring to the background of the chain of murder.
The German emission 'Hürriyet' nor insists chart this mental connection.
"beginning to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
Stresses that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and his subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not looked much earlier suspects in the circle of the far right.
One shows the less rhetoric about the drastic means: "Now here is lost, immigrants are left more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction across the network.", he writes, "Selen."
That means that, if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln Solingen and will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been etched in the memories of German and Turkish.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat, and the Germans, mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks underscore the sense of Group of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press criticism was then mainly the weakness of the German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack with a fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, Foreign Affairs Minister, replaced him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel outlined in his speech that contribute to the taxes the Turks in Germany.
It is clear how it calculates the value of a person, depending on the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media returns to show how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and a revaluation of the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time requires frank words.
The Bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The Bank riskier of Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now runs a German.
Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.
After his dramatic departure from the Summit of the federal Bank, in July, it was reported that in a new beginning in 2013 and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the Administrative Council of the great Swiss Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS by his new-found strength and slipped kind remarks about her future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all security systems of the Bank and let down 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general Manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The Chairman of the Administrative Council of USB was seen since then also touched, and everyone asked: what Comes Axel Weber?
It was reported that Weber must advise the Bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard to Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, rather, a Professor of Economics and Director and has had a period of adaptation certainly needed.
Coup is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title "the largest bank in the scandal of Europe for a long time."
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the largest manager of global assets, and on the other hand, for years, is mired in a scandal at the next.
Nothing, it seems, will save the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss administrator of property, discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's big banks.
This impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent Professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "to my students, I have always called the USB as a model of a good bank."
"from today's point of view, one wonders: how I might be wrong?"
It was a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general Manager, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly.
A few months later, it was suspected the reason.
The investment fund of Bank embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to repay billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, some investors found naturally look with disdain until shortly before: a State fund Asia and opaque of Singapore and an Arab State fund, so discreet, who had never heard his name.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, worsened.
The Bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, the Chairman of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second highest-paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, continued the catastrophe, in view of their wrong investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought securities at the UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which became co-owners of the Bank.
Throughout Switzerland was affected, it was stated as dramatic as that for a small country, whether houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can not return to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over details of wealthy clients, who had possibly disappointed taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, adopts a figure of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of undue benefits of these deals with compensation for payment.
With that, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously lost something that had long been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the glow of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of clients funds.
In this way, in a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in its two focal sectors: in the investment banking through the erroneous speculation and the administration of property through the help of fiscal fraud.
And just when I was back a little calmer, just when it thought that the UBS returned to achieve it, is this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the Bank realised that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.
"with the case Adoboli states that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a Professor of Economics and Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it dominates the controls of risk."
So that the concept of precaution, with the Swiss Bankers were long, being the guardians of the greatest assets of the world: no risk too great, in contrast, the security of the money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
Security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of the unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli chocolate genuine.
The centerpiece of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the strong Swiss private bank, is just a bit higher.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the summits covered in snow in the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here are jewellery shops like Tiffany `s between traditional business as the Swiss Sprüngli confectionery.
Here lie for years the Swiss banks: since the National Bank, via the Palace of Credit Suisse, until the private banks as Julius elitarios Bär.
It comes in the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are coated in front of marble, are big leather armchairs, along with the logo of the Bank is a great sign to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the customer seeks here: security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have shifted the idea of the great Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as is the President of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end of the day, as all Swiss Bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There, the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"and they have long accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the investment banking Anglo-Saxon, gave his first major gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was evident.
"This Wednesday, the coalition Government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," the author writes Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("the crash of the UBS" in English).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros to save the large bank of bankruptcy.
What happens?
They spoke with Swiss bankers, and see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the tiny Switzerland, and continues to grow.
It helped that the two different banks precursors of the UBS complement: a Bank rich but slept with the Center of the administration of property in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.
Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great financial bicycle.
There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS Peter Wuffli, head of the Consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," said the expert in banking Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, intellectual, modest, that means a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to brighten since learning in the Bank until the Summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably committed a fatal flaw: "thought that their models were a reality," said Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
It is tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: the blunder came before the event.
Employees of the UBS clearly remember the meetings of directors, Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: lower the throne at Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world.
"The League Tables" topped the rankings, which then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the Summit.
Some steps you went well.
In the currency and in the negotiation of actions was at the top.
However, advisers from companies responsible highlighted a weak point: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Growth Ávidos, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in high-risk American investment.
It transformed into a powerful machine to securitise mortgages Americans and sell them below, maintaining certain risks on their own account.
And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great euphoria, so deep in the fall.
A manager had to go, because the attempt to order was more complicated than expected.
The posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and unsafe until today.
Currently, who heads a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, ending the investment banking, concentrating on the administration of property, returning to the Swiss roots.
The Bank does not go so far (yet).
But the investment banking should decrease much, is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new Chairman of the Bank, will present its future strategy in the world.
In reality, only thought italiano-suizo in 51 years as a transitional solution, as the Bank, the Bank was separated from his predecessor, surprisingly Grübel.
In the meantime, he was imposed, should lead to a permanent business of UBS, reported the Bank in Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the Investment Bank to its rule in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is this?
What wants to make money?
These are the questions that insurance is currently Axel Weber.
So far only said that first seek shelter with his wife in Zurich.
The following year.

Smart stretch Grajos in cities
In many places the birds are considered grajos "problematic": no one was expelled inteligentísimos these animals in the city for a long time, say experts.
Some, like others want to get rid of them very fast, grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from neighbours by the rubbish and the noise of animals.
Although there has been no way against the bird "problematic" until now.
The already grajos not leave cities, say experts in the first symposium on grajos in Leer, East Friesland.
There the specialists throughout the national territory dispute on possible solutions.
Seeking alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attributed the problems of cities to migration from the countryside of certain chemical grajos protected; applications in agriculture have visibly with traditional living spaces.
Hunt, growing Building and falling trees that host strain bird life.
The grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs breeding in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 jumped into the negative headlines in the press a controversial project to kill en masse grajos district.
Critics have described the hunting of the animals for trapping birds and the murder with sticks as particularly brutal.
"driving and driving away the normally do not get anything," said Werner Klöver, town and country of Leer.
Fire with water to the nests or throw the trees are often unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, an expert in Lahr environment, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are diverted, large colonies of divided and distributed in other places."
Drive the only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, no longer the trap."
Without the surroundings, will not solve the problem in the cities, said Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible a combination of scaring animals in residential areas and sensitive bait to return to settle in other places.
"information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and etnóloga publicises contrary to treat animals in a completely different way: "the best thing is that we can withstand a peak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Circuit on the teaching of grajos Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has its own opinion about the criticism by the sound of birds: "They are all forms of communication, have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, grajos not only use the resources to access mouthfuls shales, if not producing tools to use them as a resource.
Recently, ethologists of the University of Cambridge found in grajos four so far the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds learned quickly that they should drop a stone on a platform in order to achieve a larva of moth.
Without much training, acknowledged with determination the size and the form it should take the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the shrewd should resolve grajos a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a larva of moth in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach its prey with the peak.
But researchers have left a piece of wire.
With the four animals formed a hook, which caught the bucket in the shooter of the tube.
Three of the four did grajos at the first attempt.

Massacre at a personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the pain of the battle (The Sorrow and the Beauty): an intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long type dramatis personae that can make you fall into one heart.
Here are some tips for action: grubbing-up mildly this page and turn the page on its brand.
Come to know very well to these people in the narration novelística Mr Englund dramatis personae, and this function as its GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, as one of his men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which describes, rightly, as "a work of Anti-History."
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, "a book about how it happened." talking about "feelings, thoughts, experiences and states of humour."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experience in times of war of plus or minus 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanical at escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members would be crazy or die.
Their lives here as parpadean votivas lit candles at a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others are going.
The book by Mr Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War, was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves so expertly through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; you spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a book touching, almost from the start.
The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina reeks of cordita.
When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is at home with your children, or you are huyes?
Anyway, what is?
Almost nobody understands what is happening, even by what it takes to fight this war.
"lack of facts," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German fleet of high seas.
Their stories have been obtained for the most part of memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.
Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more alive in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and cope with what we have.
About telling the story of a German schoolchild said: "Substitutes substitutes, everywhere."
"ersatz coffee, aluminium false imitation, rubber, paper, bandages buttons of wood."
Still talking about the meal surrogate in Germany.
"meat describes made from rice cooked in fat and squeezing carnero (and topped off with a bone false made of wood; tobacco fact roots and parings of dry potatoes; shoes with soles of wood."
There is, he notes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered."
Some stories are about the honour and courage.
An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and said about the war: "you feel that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that veneer means civilization and that there is not a brute behind pechera almidonada tachonada and that."
Instead of a British soldier realizes that will probably die, and that no one will notice or care.
"once you resign themselves to the thought of sacrifice, one would hope that could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a person being strangled in secret."
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century bestiario: the mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes of clothing that carries his shop while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.
Mr Englund spoke of the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading the service at the front.
"the most bizarre expression of this can be seen trade gonocócico, that we buy embadurnan with soldiers and their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate as looking over their eyes, which often leads to blindness for life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task.
In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war "waged exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, as The Great War and the memory of modern Paul Fussell, or novels as No novelty in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive histories.
The volume of Mr Englund joins a Pantheon unconventional.
His book is one of the most devastating end that I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
Do not disclose.
But it is as if he had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.
After one false step before a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
They chose the night from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was held in secret, except for a few high-ranking officers, saying initially to others that they were joining an exercise.
The Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underscored how the operation was plagaba of challenges for the Police Department.
They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as espray of pepper spray on the protesters, breaking the rules of the Department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas."
And that is why the police operation to clear the protesters from Zuccotti Park revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared, seeing as it had developed the occupations in other cities.
A mock major catastrophe was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking into Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called training of disorder - counter-terrorist measures involving swiftly to mobilize large numbers of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last meeting of training was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the last minute, "said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the Mission only as" an exercise ".
"The few polis that I know that they were called for this, I told them that it was to enter the park Zuccotti," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew that they were going to enter the park Zuccotti were at the highest levels of the Department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson for the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged ahead of time after hearing about the plans.
The operation of the Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the borough - dozens of mobile operators routinely used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who commute to work, had been going up and coming to the park during the day, making the 1 p.m. a good time to go.
"It was appropriate to do so when the fewest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers congregated at the junction of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before exiting.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that retumbaban from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
The agents of community affairs were at the park with his clear blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up his things and left.
Do not touch any shop until the, Broj 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time for the protesters to collect their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that it was for their safety.
But many journalists said they tried to avoid coming to the police to take action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by agents.
Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, they were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the dense thicket of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and bags of garbage, paper and plastic packed with clothes, teams of the Department of Cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged away, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A core group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp candaron between them by the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly.
The agents of the emergency service were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 more or less a. m., said Mr Kelly.
The road-clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbing the public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The most senior officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the Department, the senior uniformed Officer in the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the Chief of detectives of the Department, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, "he was not running the operations," said Mr Browne.
A second group of players expected along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to go.
There were barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block to the South.
Since these positions, he was at the police to expand beyond the perimeter of the Park Zuccotti.
At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people on the outside.
There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most vocal of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood went flying from the crowd.
In the end, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The Union of support workers sued the City by redundancies
The Union, which represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon at the disposal of the Union, the borough 37, in their effort to repeal the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost its work on 7 October, in a move that union leaders have described as a political revenge for his refusal to allow, last spring, access on the part of the city at a depth of healthcare by working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing at the City Council last month, the Director of Education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council RUF retaliated by saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the support staff of the school would be dismissed.
Officials of the borough 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education that would be sued. Be held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the claim, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Education Department of the city as defendants, and has eight redundant workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like the majority of people who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been inadequately subsidised of chronic form.
It said that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit said, "this is not a wealthy suburb of parents to raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the district 36 fell 3.26% this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrolment for poor schools.
The Union also argues that the directors of secondary schools may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes more often the act of removing a master of the payroll of a school with a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central Office.
"sixty six coordinators of parents were dismissed," says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus."
Closed mission, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
Finally seems to Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was required was that the rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate will consider a resolution, sponsored by the Chairman John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties fought among themselves and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution that authorizes the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and that never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut the funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the mission of US in a kind of purgatory legislature - with Congress sufficiently embarrassed to criticize Obama's handling of the Mission, but not as angry as to actually take the grass beneath their feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO Mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for its tremendous courage and remarkable resilience to free themselves" and "commends the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners are engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition towards democracy in Libya."
The new measure would win the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as the bill in June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the top Republican on the Committee.
The spokesman of Venue said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually achieves a vote by the entire Assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have failed so far to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Of Goodlatte is the only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance just in the House, and another handful that "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical between themselves, but they give their sponsors - mostly Republicans novice seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote an amendment of the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while the Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of New York, wants to remove the two-term limit for Presidents.
The Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as banning flag-burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the States.
So enthusiasts who have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In Congress, lawmakers proposed 111º 77 amendments, and made 66 at 110th.
The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when members regularly featured more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they did not have much more successful then than it is now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"beaten but not defeated," Giffords spoke in his first interview since the shooting on TV
Ten months after a gunman fired him at close range at a constituent event in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, sang accompanied by the melody of Broadway, "the sun will come out tomorrow," and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The programme documented their difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that shattered the skull and drilled the left side of her brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, again by surprise to the House to vote triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, and sang River - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords, 41, responded: "quite well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program "20/20" of one hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book, "the pair Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting on 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, you see it in his hospital bed, his head shave and a long scar across his face.
It can only have one or two fingers, while her husband erguidos behind.
Months later, sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to perform simple actions.
A movement of the head.
One of fruncimiento lips.
And then, her first word: "what".
In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "tostada", a request for a change in its breakfast menu.
Footage broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: sees the Congressman singing along with therapists songs, "Ms. Girls Just Have Fund" and Cyndi Lauper's "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours of therapy every day, he said that he did not recall the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the killing of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held at a Missouri prison and is being medication by force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," he said Giffords to Sawyer.
"tough, tough, tough."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of the recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I told him, `Gabby, it has not been defeated," said Kelly.
"Just has been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to catch you and you're going to come back stronger than ever. "
Troops felt more pity that respect
The event was a gala of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, and aviators and marines stormed their posts around him.
The crowd of label got up and applauded.
"men and women were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fund-raising in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"The show as a kind of orphaned children," the Officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
It took.
But it was not respect, really. It was regrettable.
The contradictory impressions starkly illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorador.
It extends to the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, told members of the service.
The public increasingly acts as if given penalty those in uniform.
"We are not suffering at all," said Brigadier-General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon head to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of souls helpless."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to sound ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the ira faced troops who returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, the majority of the talks on the pity was conducted in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine Corps, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some regard them with a sense of fear that clashed with insurgents and travelled to exotic locations.
Others will wonder whether there would be a "veteran angry and violent beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington.
During their job search, he said, felt that some interviewers subtly had asked him whether he would be able to stand up under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.
"When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative perceptions," recalled Cancian telling it to their children.
The military concern stems, in part, of the American indifference towards the wars.
The gains on the battlefield are rarely elected to the praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, we do not appreciate the military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
In contrast, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women with a case against the army for its alleged passivity in the face of the violation.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are planning for the next one.
The soldier from 1st Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she said she was raped by a fellow student.
It was October 2008, and went back to their headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who was wearing a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink.
"sounded an alarm signal," said Lyman.
However, the native Texas left aside his concern.
I thought, no, has 19.
"It is in Texas," he said.
"I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, throwing down and violating the claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand is filed against former Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go on trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand implied initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke said that going to the leadership of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? the high command."
Burke also said that since February, have been in contact with nearly 400 survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.
His strategy: instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present a number of cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed defence strategy - in essence, that the military can not be sued for current or former soldiers from injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a Judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"the damage alleged is part of the military service of the plaintiffs," say the documents.
The Defense Department declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
Whereas women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear lines of the front.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time that the army will also be modernized, Burke said.
She is not alone in their struggle, and three other demands are in progress, in addition to the machine.
In the Yale Law Clinic for Veterans Legal Services is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting an environment misogynistic.
Moreover, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a claim against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" allocated to victims of rape in order to give them the high service - a common occurrence, according to activists like Association Bhagwati Action Network of Women in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing the discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
They have submitted nine separate bills in Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and the response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure in approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report, published in March, also examines the indices of processing: in 2010, 20% of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described the attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation of the military police in less than an hour after it had happened.
That night, he said, was asked to have the details of its violation 11 different times in a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having had sexual intercourse with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as witnesses of personality in the name of the suspect, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought that I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I said to my commanding officer," that was not his view. That was my opinion. "
At Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for the service.
In January 2010 was discharged from the service under menos-que-honorables terms, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law George Washington.
However, he said, "In my opinion, should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence of responsibility.
He added: "the chances are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the audience is not on its way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, made the tail in their hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We are going to continue to fight against the army in this item until the reform will take place," he said.
"or until we killed, whichever occurs first.
The walls have eyes: How to Get researchers are studying in Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba its anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having made a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time leading up to the attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy - but you have to go on Facebook.
"We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on the European digital populism by the British think-tank DEMOS.
The cache of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett said, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years.
The team of Bartlett found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then you went announcements, but instead of linking them to a new band or product of diet, advertisements inviting users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the room.
"It is a whole new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of turnaround, "those who combine their activism in line with the offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the "likes" messages on the walls and updates of State.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova" of Facebook is fueling a boom of the investigation, boosting the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title until nearly 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to study the people that you could not bring yourself with a folder on the street.
"before, when intentabas to survey people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go through the party, and they would never get access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all of that - you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the problems of salud-social.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that college students who spoke of their exploits of binge drinking on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drink that students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggested that fellow students, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of State with its binge drinking.
"You can not treat a problem if you can not diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of the Child in the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinchando" to his own people to obtain data.
The Team Data site has produced statistics on the status of the relationship and the Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should be available to other large amounts of data for research).
However, users of Facebook know that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to the thousands of kilometres away is to allow the site to undermine your personal information.
But what happens when users of Facebook become part of a survey that even know?
While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data offline and online is a free lunch for all.
"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be reviewing their profiles," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study carried out with the walls of public Facebook students.
"as far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic this being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information in the profile of a user and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a pen sujetapapeles and remain the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is No substitute for entry into the real world and talk to real people," he said.
"social research is supposed to be on social terms - and a lot of the social still happening offline."
"cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik made his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter for the "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway," said before a room packed with 500 people.
"I am opposed to the Court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their points of view."
For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written statement beforehand, to contact the families of their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of Breivik look in the eyes, other to confirm that it is kept under lock and key.
All attended with the goal of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya to ​ ​ Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"it was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at journalists and survivors in the eye when they entered and left the building.
Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of "resistance", the judge ruled that it is not a mental illness, and said that there was no evidence that he acted with co-conspirators.
It is possible that some are comforted that attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist in place of a radical group.
But that does not automatically eased the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish that it seems a monster, but we do not think so," said a family member of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seems."
7 lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, is shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of the technology as the Great Inventor Moderne.
But what the fans of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs Rediscovered recently has been dusted in advance of a series of special screenings in the major markets this week, is how much understood this creative minds about business processes and workflows of products.
It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also an organizer of a meticulous and yonki flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is to think that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Nerds (The Triumph of the triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extended and rare conversation.
At that time had passed barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and we worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the adoption of a popular Internet.
While a small part of the interview Cringely was used in Nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director.
This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: the Lost Interview, 68 minutes, at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies.
And very muses.
In four different locations throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, seeking clarification.
There are also moments when the perfection of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, pushing him to go faster towards the items or arguments of utmost importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what it sees that other companies do good and evil, and offers its own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something crude and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the dreamer poised on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, and it was made.
A quick summary of seven remarkable footage of The Lost interview:
On how he learned to carry a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked:" Why do things? "and the answers that you give an unchanged:" Oh, that is just the way it goes. "
No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounts of Apple.
Baffled by the way with the costs - often starting with a "standard cost" on rough estimates, and then was consistent with a "variable" - developed an automated factory which ensured that could determine business costs in detail.
On the joke with the Pope:
"Jobs narrates the Blue Box" which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people to effectively hackear telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT & T, while creating a loop with the greatest number of satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and again a minute later to the public telephone of the door," says Jobs with risita one.
"We were young and I learned was that we could build something ourselves that we could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was a lesson incredible, and I do not think that Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost dropped out, calling on the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several Members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk with the American diplomat, the two erupted in laughter just before the very Pope was excited to go to answer the phone.
On falls in love of technology (and telemarketing with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build an accountant of frequency, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and made him a call.
Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard part-time.
"that was a significant influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the employees of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first computer of panel has ever done."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen of cathode tube, and I enamoré.
Get a trip to HP as a teenager and lost time with that machine and write programs for it.
About improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs spoke about inventing new products on the march.
Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of base plates, a customer asked if it could put the whole team.
Working with just 30 days of credit, had to find out the Assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while in Apple, recalls the struggles faced in the development of a computer mouse.
"I remember having dramatic arguments... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build by 15 million and that it was completely reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he heads the rebirth of Apple, Jobs presciently foresaw the way in which many industry leaders encountered in his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"say that you have worked at IBM or Xerox, copiers and printers do better, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more successful.
The departments of sales and marketing increase the success, so they are the kind of people who run companies and individuals responsible for the products were expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position rots because people do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the craft necessary.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have hijacked the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times its size, it could have been the Microsoft in the 1990s...
They took the defeat of the victory.
On the innovation as artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it develops the big idea, changes and grows."
We learn much about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices that you have to do some things that you can not do that make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - is limited to try to expose yourself to the best that a team of human has done, and then try to adapt those things that you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never had a shame about stealing great ideas.
What made in large part to the Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it was not for it, could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas cenan with rivals in the law of healthcare while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether to accept the challenge to the healthcare law President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers to set out the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the total reform of healthcare passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the demand and, in fact, is expected to be a landmark case of 5 1/2 hours in March, and the result is likely to further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the decision of the Court is known.
The lawyer to appear before the Court and argued that the law should be dismissed will probably be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles.
Another firm sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the Court on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican in the Senate and an opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards.
Indeed, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If it were, it could be argued that fall under the Code of Canon 4C, which reads: "A judge can attend events to raise money for organizations connected with the law and other, although the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appear on the agenda of this event."
However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas absolute two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of Ethics in Government.
"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the Code goes against the demands of several judges to comply with the Court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Causa Común).
"The judges were agasajados at a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the Court."
His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by critics who say that mixes too easily the activity of the Court with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Solicitor general for the Obama administration when it filed the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan refrain of the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that it will do.
Boeing receives a request record of 18 billion
The airline Emirates seeks 50 double corridor Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft stands at a record of 18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a gold mine in future growth in orders for aircraft.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend called for its largest history for commercial aircraft from its dollar value Boing 777 jets - 50 double corridor.
The successful request came from the airline Emirates in Dubái.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total sale price at $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Hall of Air Dubái 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel savings and services for passengers spectacular.
The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are the property of their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but that an increase in fuel prices - usually bad for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the market of wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt of his rival Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 airliner.
The victory of Boeing's fair in the air comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with 777-300ER the.
Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers require an increase in the payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co climbed 1.5 per cent until 67,94 dollars.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon said that the drugs helped his opponent of the IRS, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the election of the violent State, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for Governor of the Western state of Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the electoral process, and particularly yesterday, is alarming, not only in Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... seized the polls, erected barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the IRS.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it was the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The IRS is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have overtaken by little room for Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, his brother refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of Governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home State of President Felipe Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A mayor of the NAP was killed a week before the election while making campaign by Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous local candidates left the nominations by fear.
Although the IRS, unpalatable as they appear to be the election of Michoacán, a victory would help to boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the IRS in presidential polls, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I believe that this victory should be very encouraging for the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare for helping to rescue the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term to prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, general Manager of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two great fastest-growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries adhering to the difficulties of Europe in a "fair" and said that the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We are all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe to emerge from the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can not be immune."
"So if China and India can help, by all means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that he might push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided greater bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Commerce Minister, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone remains volatile and turbulent," he said.
"We have a monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for one billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million people live with nearly $2 a day or less.
"at some point you will realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday at the beach and that will not be good," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reservation should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making as railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant knock-on effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces the "low risk" because of the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows of their economies.
The Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence
The Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget cuts looming could undermine national security and provoke a reaction in the financial chain from the corridors of the Pentagon, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, the Assembly line civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that could be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Department," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "abduction", would give rise to a 23 percent of overall reductions and a great many new projects.
"a cut of this large, applied indiscriminately, would make the bulk of our projects and naval construction could not be carried out - you can not buy three quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta Senators.
"We will also be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the willingness."
The cuts in time would amount to combat troops, Panetta said.
"While the financing for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the abduction, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," warned Panetta.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in the contracts and oversight of the contract to support the war."
"The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline in the United States as a major military Power in the world."
"We are firmly against this draconian Action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they issued the letter to Panetta.
"This is not an outcome that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"the abduction is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."
If the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensified calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, despite reaching a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that it faced difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a squad without bullets."
"It is an air wing without sufficient pilots trained."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep abreast with potential adversaries."
"In effect, invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay at the time in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the axe, including those who are already testing and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the warplane F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned ballistic submarine, the new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new combat vehicle on land that the Army and Navy humvee, need replacing.
Halting the development and additional evidence of F35 the could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
As a lie detection
A look at the most recent headlines we are an indication of just how serious and pervasive deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is occupied by exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accused of lying to the other.
The managers of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assault children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with a microphone saying to the US President, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.
The Congressman from New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with its denials quickly objections by the irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of wrongdoing in the financing of the campaign for the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one living will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton for lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Are widespread legends on the traps in reviews of school and university.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the responses of exams to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance.
Mentor should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lie and cheat are acceptable.
How much deception us?
In a single day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That sure, many of these lies are white lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential skill to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the aim is to say: "You have," the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been objections.
The Liars look them in the eye.
Not always, tartamudean balbucean, ruborizan or disturbed.
It can not be concluded that the liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A lie detector can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the statement, microfaciales expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries on deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
The good liars have the ability to read properly to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and feeling intuitively how perceived by others.
We know from research that the introverted extrovertidos lie beyond the men say more oriented towards themselves "lies", while women say more lies "geared towards others" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners that persons who are not married, but the lies that usually say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying.
How to know if someone is lying?
First, the usual behaviour of the subject.
It's called "creating a baseline."
Aid to provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.
The position of the subject, laugh and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone golpetea normally with the foot around the time for not doing unfair charges when you see golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting.
Next, find groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and non-verbal.
Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.
Those who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, can enroll their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change its stance significantly or display a "relaxation postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the difficult questions have been completed.
Often the interrogators falsely imply that the interview had completed only to seek postentrevista relief.
It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson got the LEG until the Fund and used the past while he claimed that his wife murdered was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
Those who cheat can also use a polarizing language: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Anyone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when replying to a difficult question: "well... to tell the truth... until I was... in my opinion."
This makes the answer is a perception rather than a fact, and it is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of the delay in its adoption.
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the adoption of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions, while apaciguaba environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project to return to direct it.
TransCanada said on Monday night to move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska Sandhills in, and hoped that the project won approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol in Nebraska.
The managers of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company remained confident that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project to study new potential routes that avoid the areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a massive underground water supply.
"This is a real way forward," said Representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department, it is possible that apart from any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and they expressed their full support.
The pipeline would stretch 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
Would carry 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This would require that across six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but beloved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposing the plan are weighing legislation to force a retreat from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study of the current State Department found that the project raised only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered an independent evidence of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, representing a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child vomitara of fear
A family of New York says that the music diva disk, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a mad in the lobby of the Building in Manhattan, aterrando his daughter to the point that vomitó of fear.
The tirade of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" spooked Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, both suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased its fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when the scene-shifter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, Professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk fell to the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, leading to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he stopped near the door and put her daughter in the soil for a moment.
"somebody came up behind me and said," Do you know what you are doing your daughter? "he said" yes' and I went to take it, "he said.
Angry admonished LaBelle to pregnant women.
"he said in an aggressive tone," he should not have left her daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I said," I have no interest in what you say or think. "
It infuriated and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and began to throw water bottle on me. "
He said that Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told her, 'Look what you've done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.

Climate Adversidad slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, dropped foreign investment and the economy shrank
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, calling for change, which generated high expectations for progress on the economy, but given the adversity of climate for the start of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing billions in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the State's economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic collapse of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of the impact of frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development took damage in $582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the total damage suffered 78.03 percent and the remaining 2107 percent had partial damage, the main victims were the crops of vegetables, corn and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography State unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year saw a rapid growth, while January to March sinaloenses 053 55 thousand were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent between July and September, and the average continued rising to 6.19 percent, a rate that many people cast over sinaloenses 74 000 unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 000 969 individuals.
Minor liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactor, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the School of Economics and Social Sciences UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, in terms of actions from public policy have been made.
"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for purposes of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in the Congress to combat money laundering, already for the people that grab dollars illegally is not easy to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration arrested
Lopez Cervantes noted that the increase in unemployment, there is also a factor in population.
"The number of people who are going to the State in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties for entry, and second because entering already have too many difficulties in finding work, that people are falling and is demanding jobs here in the State, which means that unemployment will rise," he said.
Informalidad
The analysis of the labour market sinaloense is compounded by considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the working population in the State works without being listed as a worker before any institution of social security.
Coupled with unemployment and informality, another labour lags in the State are low wages, the company has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 000 375 pesos.
FDI Downturn
In addition to the economic downturn and the rise in unemployment during 2011 is recorded the biggest decline of the Foreign Direct Investment in the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy January-June FDI State added 630 000 697 million, which represents a drop of 87.74% compared to the 5 million 143 000 312 million recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accounted for a total investment of 17 000 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Before the stage of economic contraction, the State Government in July for the State Congress's approval of a claim by 3 billion pesos, which would be targeted investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2 000 600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez reflects a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Industry Transformation, expressed during 2011 was absent from the harmonization of wills of different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"the performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground lost in this year, in 2012, we must redouble our efforts, not align the effort of all, and particularly the good progress already synchronized of this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo Lopez said that events like the frost from the beginning of the year stopped the State economy and restricted their performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frost, one of the main impact has been a slow economy that is not turning quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that may have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing far below the expectations that we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he is required to prosecute the State towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"overall we have noted that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that will redefine the vocation and economic course of the State, because it is important to prompt the full potential of the material and human resource of Sinaloa," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex the stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future to channel the best efforts of the Government.
"Overall, I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development, there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
Noted that the current administration has shown progress in their style of driving public policy.
"There are elements that may say that the Government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done, and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.

Court validates "analogue switch-off" in Mexico in 2015
The switch from analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that the so-called "analogue switch-off" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that the President Felipe Calderón is not overstepped its authority to issue the Decree detailing the actions to effect the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court ruled on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, owing to the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a reserved power by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchy and subordination of law.
In favour of the draft voted only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the very Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and to admit the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition.
The full Ministers also decided to dismiss the application filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said Minister does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive can not structure through general rules measures to ensure that the public service is prepared.
"Nor do I think that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the Rector of the State.
The switch from analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system, according to the principle of economic stewardship of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It can not be concluded that the executive, to issue the decree, which blow challenged in any way the competence of the Congress, because it is providing administrative enforcement of laws issued by the Legislature, assured.
Analyses possibility of one count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to data released by the COUNT the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial race is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 6 000 74 minutes total.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality in regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán where, according to data released by the Programme of Preliminary Election Results (COUNT) the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial race is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 6 000 74 minutes total.
In this regard, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, barely on 9 November, the electoral Body adopted a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled, Michoacán not accredited its Constitution and the Electoral Code of the State or its Act of Electoral Justice, whenever the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline to enter into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication on schedule in the Official Newspaper Act of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) settled the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the Mandatory state of constitutional reforms, which has no right to "punish or veto."
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the General Council of the possible IEM will be partial and total tally of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial recount of votes in one or more electoral packages, may be on the assumptions that: the results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and count in the record of the box or not in possession of the President of the same; or, if there are obvious errors or alterations of the records.
In addition, the total tally of the vote received in all cells of the election may occur when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumptive winner of the election in question and which has won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; if at the beginning of the sitting there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that applied for the second candidate.
The total tally of the vote may also be conducted if at the end of the regular count establishes that the difference between the candidate and the winner allegedly located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, if and when there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second, in which case it shall exclude the electoral packages that have been the subject of a partial recount.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where, according to the SOURCES of the difference between the first and second place is only with 0.16 percent, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

On Wednesday, he will form the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to introduce the new Government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government.
It is expected to present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when it will assume the post on new executive.
Monti said that the President will present the outcome of its talks with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I would like to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The context is now staccato-like," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy combat, a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti were boosted considerably by the backing of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, it is significant because, until now, many of its members had opposed the Government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti should have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday, its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has made an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his Government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on which politicians just give it time to implement reforms before early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be formed only by technicians, a sign of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of Spaniards is higher than ticos
Of the 22 players called for Spain, 10 more than 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned reached 50 matches.
A glaring contrast to the Costa Rica, comparing the 22 summoned by both countries for the friendly today, 3:05 p. m., at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world champions of Europe, and number one of the monthly FIFA ranquin, accounted for a comprehensive record of interselecciones games for Class A, the Tricolor alone possesses the defender Michael Umaña as the only 50 international matches.
This figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama, 0-2) (in the Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain a year of intense activity in domestic league and Cup championships, and high-level clashes in European Cup and Champions League.
This was compounded by the experience with the Spanish Thrust eliminatorias complicated in the European Championship and the World Cup.
ticos footballers, by contrast, have a limited international friction in an area, Concacaf, as that is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum register of the Spanish Selection is an archer Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England fall in London (0-1) matched the record of the Andoni Zubizarreta exportero, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas play today before the Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain internacionalidades 127.
cerebral wheel Xavi Hernández, Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the team, the Iberian Zubizarreta cited with 126 and the battering ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost near the century-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It remains with Xabi Alonso, 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
The rich, and near Michael Umaña, are the left lateral Junior Diaz, with 48 appearances and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded 30 matches, with 31, Keilor Navas Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
Of the national side, with fewer than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson debutan yet.
The all-time scorer in Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is showing more so with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in his tour of two decades of history
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the rally Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts next Sunday in the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that they will realize the dream of playing in the country.
So assured the rally and Co-Founder, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The Group is on the wing suramericana of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its single scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p. m., along with the Band angelina The X and nationals of The Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
To his supporters, Costa Rica is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will touch in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fans?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only the second time in South and Central America and has so far been grand.
I have been in Costa Rica just once, and holiday; it is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensity in the preceding days.
What do you say to its most ardent fans?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.
Some people even as regards his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does he adds that a bit of pressure on his visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We touch a pair of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have put into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How was it discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends are always going to be surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places for surfing; this was how we learn, by means of people who love the pool.
To see the tour, have been delivering shows enormous with many songs.
What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what they can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good range of songs; try to touch on a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the Repertoire.
Why is this?
I think it is partly because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire they carry while not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of why we liked these songs and that we were able to have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and I therefore believe that it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of history.
Looking back, it is hard to believe everything we have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
Firstly, I think that none of us imagine that we would be in a large rock band and have done so for more than 20 years ago that seems like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all want and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places of the world who always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What you meant to have been a key part of the emergence of grunge the?
It has always been an honour to be part of that group of big bands.
We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement stems from a group of friends and is something unusual.
Occasionally, a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave at the same time in the same city.
"We are proud and honoured to be part of the Group of Seattle.
Yet we touch with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so that we are fortunate to be friends of all of them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like you would stand united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us we have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than the duration of many bands.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, because of that, they have also opened musical avenues that give him freedom to each experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each one and could not be better.
The relationship you have with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.
How are stock?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure that we will not be too tour because it is easy to fall into this game of the large crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares.
How recalls another project Mother Love Bone?
I think we write very good songs and the principle was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disk until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because both duration and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how to make me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was an amazing man and I miss.
The band Robertas national The will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that therefore the chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals, and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why is always changing the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings the and I think the first thing that happens.
As a rally, what are their influences?
There are so many.
Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many who could talk all afternoon on falling that I love.
How Pearl Jam has managed to maintain the relevance grunge despite not being as a fad?
I think that all of us always feel somewhat disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, I am reminded of the bands that I mentioned earlier, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden Nirvana, and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is worth listening to music and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At the beginning, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
Why is this change?
It is interesting because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album which may appear leaner, but there are also songs such as The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark but may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard and are deeply obscure songs.
I believe that if there is any more trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that for me.
Also, I think that it can be a happy person and still able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is again boarding for medical tests
The former President Alberto Fujimori was detained Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength in his legs, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years, serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffering from various ailments, including a cancer in the language that has been operated on four times and kept under control.
The Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the Canal N TV that Fujimori will be evaluated during dÍas three at the National Institute of Cancer Disease to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of their lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said that he does not want because it knows innocent.
He underwent surgery four times of cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kg weight that you have joined other pathologies such as erosive gastritis quiste severe, the pancreas, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in his legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori meets detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people at the hands of a squadron of annihilation of the army which operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official party, headed by the Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, and composed of a number of ministers and businessmen, starting this Tuesday on a visit to Mexico with the aim of expanding trade between the two nations and deal with political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with a couple of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a broad agenda of meetings with political authorities, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan presidency.
The meeting between the two Presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information throughout the political issues between the two nations," according to published the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to ensure that Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France emerged when the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, included in the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community to those countries that remain tax havens, which led to the rejection of Uruguay and the so-called consultation with its Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired since November, the G20 group of developed and emerging countries more powerful in the world, and has operated with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax in order to break the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a coalition of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have operated since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber bigotudo gets the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil never Bowser, but until now it had done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" peleará for the love of the girl in technology estereoscópica.
The title, which arrives this month at the stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to harness the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the man who has to say how it should operate estereoscopía without glasses," said the head of specialist press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the videogame in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game for Nintendo originally thought for that support," because until now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Ocarine of Zelda: time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a videogame "accessible" to enjoy a smooth and rapid departure.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to integrate users less adept.
After all, most experts can give a "second round" to the levels of the game, this time have greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not to succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions is also the return of the characters in a portable console, a fact that had not been reached since 2005.
In this Nintendo videogame is flirting with the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, whereby the plumber from the whisker will have to walk mined platforms of dangers with the objective of ridding the Princess Peach.
Although the player will find developments in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also a Luigi "jugable."
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to us
President Álvaro Colom announced this Tuesday, which was handling the extradition of the Alfonso Portillo exgobernante to respond in the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
That concludes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country in the North that claimed to Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom said that its decision followed the independence of judicial and executive branches, taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.
She asserted that during his mandate "got no hands" in judicial decisions and taken upon all extraditions have known.
In addition to Portillo, will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
This fact by Colom is a formality Executive then to exhaust the judicial authorities and the constitutional process of exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Criminal Court Fifth and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo be extradited once he has settled their legal situation in Guatemala and guarantee their human rights.
Portillo was acquitted by the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was President, which was the process that predated the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, and the case reignited.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the drop in the marginalization of kids without training
The stock of the first 25 years of life of the entity of social support Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation over a quarter of a century.
This is in addition to the hundred jobs currently made for this social group.
The anniversary provided yesterday to take stock at an event at the old manufacturing complex of Fabra R Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Born in the neighbourhood of Trinijove Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradicción or in a situation of marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused to a large number of responsible entities and institutions in the last 25 years have collaborated with the Association.
The diverse representation in electoral politics, full time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the Socialist exconseller Education, Ernest Maragall, and the Mayor and current councillor exteniente ecosocialista Ricard Gomà.
Also went to the Great Hall of the Fabra R Coats the current Social conseller of Benestar i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general manager of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But stated that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current is also true, but added that the work done so far, "is a good basis."
The Chairman put Trinijove as an example to learn to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the charity and for the work," he said.
Vacated a farm where they were macrofiestas okupada
The invaders were seized in 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that living the neighbours of the 51 street Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left midday yesterday voluntarily illegally occupied the building, and they organized macrofiestas that desesperaban in the neighborhood, by court order and without the need of a police intervention.
After the operation, it changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation.
"There will now be a control of access," said the manager.
Those who had invaded okupas, 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took any electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to paint the walls and put waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted until two days and desesperaban tenants.
On the side of the building is a discotheque Balmes, 51, who was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque suggests that the invaders from the farm is unfair competition, which sold the canopy to three euros, while the discotheque worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local leisure had to respond to complaints about noise, while neighborhood, as pointed out, not the cause inconvenience customers of the club, but the inhabitants of the House okupada and, above all, attendees at the holidays organised there, that had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the inconvenience were so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "forgiven" rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks had received more complaints from neighbours by the situation.
The Chairman of the municipal branch of the PP in the City, Alberto Fernandez Diaz, claimed last week "immediately vacate the property to deal with the problems of coexistence and civility that produce neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer had only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months had been okupas entering all floors of the building and in almost all floors, and that any even has been stolen.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end the impunity and be incivismo against the firm that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, Mossos cleared a building at the Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police went up 35 street Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noted that four people entering the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Do park or mountain?
The architects agree on the timing of the announcement beyond polemics on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of 80, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration gave few tracts of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park will again be in the fable of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not aimed at the North-South axis but mountain top (bottom) - (Sea).
The rating of Collserola as natural park is in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone jabalís, with the role of the bear Yogi.
In these was until, in September, the Council megacompetición convened a composed of 16 competitions for many other gateways for Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of Park, without doubt.
Or that someone wants to put doors to the countryside.
The question goes alone: Park Collserola, or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organisational side and by what means of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among barceloneses all architects.
It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two Members of this ancient caste of elected were recognized in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few matches between the opinion barceloneses three architects, and university professors, which have been submitted.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the front coastline "is necessary to" discuss "the front of mountain", given that the speech by Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should be based on the most extensive fleet of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
"Collserola is more complex, the architect for the title of" Gates "Collserola holds a" trap "léxica: we must not think of them" as the entrance to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where we need to act. "
Roldan and Bayonne Mòdol, as experienced in the urban world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
"dangers arising from the" uncertain that today is projecting the public space "after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the" Fòrum his swan song. "
The first fear is the very definition of borders on where it can be built.
"limit is set as the next step," i.e., they exceed.
"We need to think in new instruments, urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan PGM (CPA)] can lead to real disasters."
More matter-of-fact question, Mòdol believes that simplifying the strand vallesana of Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not", by a mere topography.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the reality of Collserola "should not fall on deaf ears," but appreciates the opportunity that the City offers his body to intervene in this project, "from the first moment."
And even more, understands that the proximity of the mountains in the city is the laissez-passer that enables architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile which must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success story," said) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives way to this piece is complex, because in the foundation of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 contests have been convened cross-cutting - said - in the sense montaña-mar, but there is no longitudinal reading, to see and understand the entire area."
This leads, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in programme and with the definition of the architect of the next door.
In his view, however, the Council should ensure that the Strip immediately above the Round of FALD should provide throughout an area of equipment to make a smooth transition between the City and the Green.
Casino spares Jonás Larrazábal and free ride
After 72 days of curfew, the legal possession of the Casino Network granted clemency to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days remain imprisoned, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal agent of the Casino Network granted forgiveness before the Juzgado Segundo Criminal District, which remains a process for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Network Gil, Sergio Garcia, released a series of photos and videos in which he allegedly Manuel Jonás required him to pay a fee for the Economic Council regiomontano allowed the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public outcry, the State Attorney-General's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Mayor panista and 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the official of the Public Prosecutor in 3 Property Crimes, was transferred to the House Settlement 1, located in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital of the State.
There remained for the 49 days to issue a second restriction order after the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office ruled the offences of bribery and racketeering.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the prison in Cadereyta allegedly blackmailing with 1.5 million pesos to the owners of the Casino Network; however, only spent a few hours in the medium security prison because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the cells of the city of St. Nicholas Garza.
On 25 October, he issued an arrest warrant for the Secretary of the Second District Court of Criminal, Jorge Yanez, who said that nearly two months of investigations were found sufficient evidence to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal hold of Casino Network, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went before the Court José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the Mayor regio; so that in the coming hours could regain their freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned to García Gómez if they had repaired the damage and who the partners of the gambling house was granted a pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
With the basis for the dossier 197/2011 provides the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter may not stand any claim on the process to be followed, and that he will require repairing damage or punishment.
After the hearing, the agent of the legal gambling house near 15:50 them was ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Woods.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yanez, was transferred to the prison in the town of St. Nicholas of Garza to notify Jonas has been pardoned legally and his file will be shelved.
Also, notify the immediate release of the order issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the crash which killed the Secretary of the Interior Francisco Blake, and seven other persons.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results on the accident which killed the Secretary of the Interior Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without which the pilot could try a hard landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were right to fly.
"The elements seem to indicate that the Unit had several contacts with the ground, aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the Unit was designed for 19 people, so that it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that research in the area of impact is not reported the emergence of oil in the ground.
"in a search report that there are no parts or components of the craft in another place, the impact was presented in structural terms.
"The design of the helicopter was to 19 passengers, with appropriate requirements for transport passengers.
The plot has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the Secretary said that it was a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, could even reach a year.
For its part, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff operating at cruising speed, and that this happened in a soft ground upwards.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal operation of cruise at the moment of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six major element in the research:
visual flight:
Under the legislation, the airline flight was conducted under visual flight rules, meaning that the crew must have visibility during the flight and ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM lived right conditions for take-off, as we move the aircraft towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloud at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that the cloud the crew has sought a zone of minor elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last record of the aircraft, of the radar coincide, probably before the impact was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Scattered remnants of the plane in a small area.
The information available so far suggest that the impact happened in a straight path and hand.
The pattern of scattered remnants of the plane to presume that the helicopter hit the ground in terms of structural integrity.
There has not been found evidence of fire or explosion.
At the site of the accident are still without disclosing evidence in the remains of the craft of some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research results indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work has been found pieces of the aircraft to a rise of 9 000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground presents a slope that runs from the seven degrees until 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which they are expected to be disbanded along this route.
The information provides elements seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area cordoned off the site, about the accident, have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces Protocol to find obesity gene
Directs the Social Insurance an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, "Protocol" genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence, "which will provide markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry Speciality Hospital Medical Center of the National CENTURY, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that he joined a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses and social workers, nutriólogos.
The team is supported by specialists and students graduate of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies Cinvestav (a) of the National Polytechnic Institute IPN ().
The investigation was invited to participate in the population, whether or not to go to the sport of IMSS units participating in the Valley of Mexico, where it is carried out tests to minors, every Saturday 8:00 p.m. start.
Stressed that the Protocol began in Unity State Athletic Cuauhtémoc Poniente (Mexico), and that since 8 October, the activity is carried out in the Unit Nezahualcóyolt Mexico State Athletic (East).
Once it reaches the goal of collecting 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence (south of the Federal District) and finally in Unity Sports Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify Mexican risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
At the conclusion of this November 14 World Diabetes Day, explained that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and monitoring of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on diet.
They were also asked about the physical activity and background heredofamiliares of disease, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that lead illnesses such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Detailed that Saturdays applies to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference of), the taking of blood pressure, determining levels of glucose, cholesterol and insulin triglicéridos, and genetic (seeks to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this research reflects the concern of health professionals at the alarming weight gain in children.
'health surveys of 1999 and 2006 noted that in just six years ago, there was an increase in the case of children, from 77 percent in obesity, and girls of 47%; in terms of overweight is also observed a dramatic rise', stressed the specialist in the IMSS.
Indicated that the justification for the search of the markers relies on the fact that the population of the country differs from others for his genetic history.
Reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian Heritage, 30% European and 5% African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) and stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if present some degree of overweight or obesity.
Indeed, he said, the presence of folds of dark colour acantosis) (in neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic disorders and until prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered in writing to parents who were explained each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be done to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: the sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e., the increased consumption of azucaradas drinks, tamales, carbohydrates (bread, pizza, hamburger, etc) with high in fats and proteins and genetics discussed in this Protocol.
UNAM Asfalto avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher in the School of Chemistry at UNAM, develops with asfaltos modified polymers to produce a mixture with improved performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Mexico Valley metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry FQ (UNAM), who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is apt, potholes could be reduced in number, or even eliminate it altogether.
In his Conference a technological view of potholes, made in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory at his office asfaltos develops modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of asfaltos modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance, and therefore the formation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, asfaltenos calls, and other low molecular weight, maltenos calls, which together give him to the pavement characteristic behavior viscoelástico.
The behaviour viscoelástico asphalt is that high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets, the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that will change during the day in accordance with environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of material, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each kit, piedritas constitutes said, is awash with asphalt.
The transit vehicles and generate efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt is disseminated even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt, enough, it puts a final layer of rolling so-called kit, which is made of a material of stone, i.e., a fine sand also washes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of cars, should have more mechanical force that the asphalt and provide friction in the way.
As part of the carriageway is going to receive and impart efforts, the kit rolling requires also have the right thickness and care must be the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt.
When the ground Wets, water is spreading in the interior of the kit and it is difficult to leave, it causes a thaw in all strata of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, is the first to wear the film tread and only then affects the asphalt, but the damage does not happen overnight, but it is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
It is also a member of the National Research System explained that the vehicular burden is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer on the pavement should always be in connection with the vehicular burden and to ensure compliance, to prevent the formation of potholes frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt emulsions, for example, the TAR, that other countries are already including in the market and to repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures.
What is missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna did not achieve the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 Princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the appetite of the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of winners, wearing the crown of silver and the gang credited as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the Crown and sceptre, the Department has risen to 14 degrees of Princess and Melina was one of the Legion of vallecaucanas women who have been near the Crown but were proclamations Princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question is how many are missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite with each submission showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected as Queen of the Police and Better Face Jolie of Vogue, titles won queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first is considered a key factor in the decision of the jury to appoint the First Princess is not impressed with his answer to the question, "What is this book that you set for yourself and why made by Martin Murillo Gómez, the Literary Carreta Leamos.
interrrogante vallecaucana responded to the:
"I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturalizarse definitely think that the book that I set of childhood principito" is ", the book is quite profound.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of world literature that everyone should read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called "the ardor of blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizarse" and second for failing to explain specifically how each of the books that cited the mark.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result, "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "the" principito is a great book. "
Among the assumptions made says that the burned Valley favouritism.
A journalist bogotano hinted that to be the preferred candidate ovacionada, and that was all preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote for the best artisanal clothes, and Queen Mother), "that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó Queen and therefore not shone in the scene."
And that was reflected in his first appearance in a bathing costume on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation.
Although lució in both safe, it showed that he lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic, it showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "at home", the Channel RCN felt that the fact that Melina outside designated Princess "found that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest is not as Queen."
In addition, Valle was at the last very elusive with the press, and there was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, that is, at last, the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to the social needs of their country.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
There is also speculation that Valle guilty by its flaws in the fibrosis derriere and that he noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose as the candidate "natural beauty" with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.
The developer Queens Jorge Hernan Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, "but your problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very visible, it dropped points in the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the surgery vallecaucana were practised.
"The surgeries are good, but not the Valley was able to do.
His body was never strong and here is the cost. "
For this award, which for the first time released the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a bathing costume emerged a cruel heralding that last night was met, it was said that this was that Raymundo contentillo denied to Melina not to give you a taste of the Crown.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina since today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for designation of the National Contest.
However, it will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its overwhelming step by Cartagena, was elusive Crown.
It was the work of the identified caleño that the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lofoscopista went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November a CTI lofoscopista Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the main leader of the Farc, "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of their fingerprints.
Of the seven who work at the station lofoscopistas CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada carried 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where many times had to be placed by more than five days in the jungle to arrive at the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley, and then to conduct training courses, specializing in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar warned him to carry a minimum clothing for three days.
Something big is expected.
The Friday night left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
I knew that it should identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who headed the oldest guerrillas in the world, so I asked him to carry the 10-finger card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the signs do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a Eliazar transplantador and a flashlight, comparing the fingerprints of the body with the card.
His eye was not ruled: "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man native Puerto Tejada was to confirm to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the main leader of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
For one of the Cali dactiloscopista Sijín recognition that made the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference by the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
Many people are not aware of our work.
It is an exact science dactiloscopia, with no margin for error, which may prove to be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lofoscopistas support research for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of persons captured.
When caught, many offenders present false papers or papers.
We take the fingerprinting and seek in the database.
The investigator told that, in a case of theft, it fell to him to remove a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported their power to take a vault full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to draw a fingerprint - but, in that case, we were able to obtain the footprint of any hand and identify the offender, who had participated in various thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints may also exclude or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.
I recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around them.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a family member might be suspected of the crime and, indeed, an imprint on the bottle coincided.
But this does not guarantee that it has been the murderer, it is found at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactiloscopista explained that the objects' fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. "
When they appear, they use a tape transplantador or to lift them.
After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the database of crime, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," indicated the expert from the CTI.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI.
As well as not all that glitters is gold, not everything that touches turns footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the match.
The "indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters in the square agolpaban Zuccotti to camp.
A large part catered the eviction order paruqe and moved to a nearby.
The members of the Movement takes Wall Street challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York to try to come back, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square of Manhattan where they were evicted from early morning and trying to occupy another Park in the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of protesters in the square agolpaban Zuccotti, where they wanted to access through a court order allowing the "indignant" return to camp at the scene, while another part of the Movement responded to the eviction to occupy a park to the north of the city, where there has been further arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp out in the square, we are going to install elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the Movement, "took Wall Street", Mark Bray.
He explained that the response of the "indignant" at the eviction from their camp made personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived at court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" came to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the centre of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for one hour managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although he could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Efe that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The Organization ensures that several hundred people had been installed at that point, which already has shifted a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the square Zuccotti - which is a compound of private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday, which must review the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the protesters displaced until there were allocated to these hours and copies of the court order and even surrendered to officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who complained that some officers beat demonstrators.
The injunction prohibits authorities to evict members of takes Wall Street or implement "laws that were published after the onset of the occupation or ban the protesters re-entering the park with tents or other properties that used previously."
The Mayor Bloomberg outlined in the press that, owing to the court order, the city had suspended the re-opening of the space to the public and to the protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to return to install with tents and sleeping bags.
The eviction regidor defended personally carried out dawn of Zuccotti Square, an operation which saw around 200 arrests and decided that the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "in a place where people do not venÍan to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others," because "some business habÍan received threats" and "temÍan neighbors for their quality of life."
"the eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the Movement, who accused the Mayor of "lacking the respect for freedom of expression."
Those responsible for "took Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organise "major action" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to mark the two-month duration of the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special TV
Alongside Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme, "it's Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," "Baywatch lifeguard in conejita", "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" baladista) (Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme, "it's Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December, giving rise to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV circulated today images of the television programme in which Anderson, also known by the wide distribution of a homemade video on the internet porn features along with her then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger muñeco a representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a presenter on the part of the tour, "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special of CTV account with the Canadian Singer Bublé, at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that there is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "Fox" to the American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan has surfaced after the earthquake
GDP grew 1.5 per cent thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst natural disaster in the country nipón since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo pinned material losses at $300 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure of GDP between July and September, served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter and 6 percent in annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is, moreover, the fastest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, for the Rally of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment in a 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditures to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the real trigger of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invited to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This variable broke a 1 per cent, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan's currency - has become one of the "safe haven" selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for US, a privilege that weighs a regions in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose survival is determined by the economic health of large groups of the technology.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September to the value of the yen.
While the markets remain with their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower our guard.
"We must be alert to the risks that remain, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the Member States filed in September, more visible signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy underscored that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths until 100.4 points, compared to $100.8 August.
The euro zone, even below the average, which is at the level of 100, in the rush to 99,13 eight decimal points.
Athens returns to feed doubts
Papadimos said to be approved adjustments, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the risk premia peripheral fired and uncertainty reinstated in the wooden floors, Greece is still stumbling into the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional Government Hellenic has more imposed by the requirements of Brussels for a genuine belief of the political forces began to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days agreed in its designation may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the due date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," asserted Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras not dispels doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything."
The Conservative leader was a step further in its standoff with the EU and the IMF, the agencies must unlock $8 million that Athens urgently needed, and made clear that it would not give its blessing to any commitment letter of compliance of adjustments.
But the European Commission escocida, even by the impact caused by the referendum órdago Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that its demand is strong: do not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties "Greeks do not sign a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will return "very soon" in Athens to discuss with the new Government, "What is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek knot has yet to come.
Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope."
The Queen stresses the place "dominant" of Spain in relation to this type of finance
"Spain has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of the Microfinance."
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has emerged in the last two decades in the second donor posed in relation to this tool of cooperation, whose "essence" noted that lies in being a "tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen opened yesterday the V Global Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that is kind of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by United Nations with Horizon 2015, and, in particular, "he who has a target of halving the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, with which sets the" poverty line ".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and performs this task with" responsibility, "said Sofia, who waited that initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which runs until Thursday," to ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, "main beneficiaries of these loans.
"Many achievements" and "many challenges that we face."
The Microcredit Summit arises not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform to push "two basic goals."
Thus, His Majesty explained that he hopes that by the end of 2015 are 175 millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and that 100 million households out of the poverty line in the extreme.
The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago of a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, I emphasise Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition."
It described the father of this tool as an "idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work has known about 15 years ago, when the Queen visited Bangladesh to hear on the ground by its lending policy.
This experience followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other events, such as those in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "all I saw the continuing evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project earned him yesterday as the "head of family" gathered at Valladolid on the part of the "baquero of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded his speech by encouraging you to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic State.
In this sense, said that it would be a mistake to link the cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, because it is a "permanent obligation."
Jimenez found that micro-credits posed "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and "now more than ever," Governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to "excluded people who all shut the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present in a city that "opens its doors caught the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the President of Europe by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Union (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democrat party.
Initially had not been included in the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the policy of the Government is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the leadership, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.
standing ovation for the several minutes it won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, will allay any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: "The response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "The time has come to open the way in Europe."
This could occur in the amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage, "to give a face to Europe."
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 27 to reach an early agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority of the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank in terms of weight of each economy, which obviously would reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm tempers within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is it has tried to win over its Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentado in France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government launched an offensive against the sickness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, as appellant since 2007, of the fight against fraud and punished.
Moreover, to accompany this offensive, that part of the will to save rigorously, but still recalls a linchpin of the presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before they can take the low.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill lost four days of pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
It is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
Moreover, it would be accompanied by another measure with a reach more symbolic: impose officials a day of absence without pay in the event of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
As we discuss these issues, the majority returns to put on the table as the question of fraud, this time directed towards the abuse of parental leave.
"They will substantially increase the controls and, furthermore, if someone was caught in a fraud to repay the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
Like the other cases, the impact of the announcement seemed slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the area of low labour.
In fact, since 2002, is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit.
The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.
Look carefully, firstly, national figures.
According to the French Institute of social Security (CNAM), in 2006, was paid more than EUR 237 million in benefits for leave.
According to the French Institute research and documentation in economics of health, subsidies for low represented, in 2008, 5 percent of health-care spending, rising to $11.3 million euros.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54 percent is connected with the sickness, a figure that amounts to $6.2 million euros.
Consequently, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have grabbed an average of   14.5 days off work, compared with $17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Group Alma Consulting.
An average that, without doubt, hides diversions: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster. com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 employees of French respondents claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010, 37% of the sickness lasted less than 8 days, 22 per cent of between 8 and 14 days, 15 percent of between 15 days a month, and 15 per cent of between one and three months and 11 percent were more protracted.
Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to get sick.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the sickness is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
The fraud has a rather limited.
The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of the sickness of more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found, in 13% of 285,000 made, that the casualties of short duration were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, found that 11% of the cases were "properly adapted or unjustified; a figure, taking as a total of $1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Therefore, it makes a total of 169,000 cases "unjustified" among several million workers who caught a sick leave.
Without doubt, a miniscule compared with, for example, the black economy.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of revenue of between 9,000 and $15 million euros per year, i.e., more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, without doubt, significantly more than the fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece will need to implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten out its economy.
This is what you said on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; further added that the 100 days that have been granted to her Union Government would not achieve that objective.
"For efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," declared the Head of the Government, which made its first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of the eurozone on 27 October, will be the "primary task" of the new Government, "is at stake," the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has projected that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "until around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group showed on Monday, supporting the measures already adopted to try to overcome the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," said during a meeting with members of his party   New Democracy. "
She expressed agreement with the goals of reducing the deficit and the debt, as well as the fight against wasteful, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU had not released the loan of $8 billion euros needed without a written guarantee of the cross-party support for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough, and they would not sign anything because of the external pressure.
A committee of experts said that they should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Canadians live denying the death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives denying death.
Indeed, only 9% of Canadians is ready to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make provisions to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical.
This Committee recommends that the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is that option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For a start, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of the death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth post, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of the death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians wishes to die at home, just 68.6 per cent of them died in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard the registers Quebec, where 86% of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it wishes to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its implementation, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.
"in Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."
"in Canada is practised assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favouring euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since we believe that allowing persons whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey conducted by Angus Reid in 2010.
In addition, 66 per cent believed that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not understand that the lives of the elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to the people who have practised assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed that it should not start proceedings against them.
In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations suggest that specified in the penal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also seeks to train health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear to deal with a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in connection with the palliative sedation or terminal, which is already used extensively in health institutions of Canada, the Committee calls that, except that serve to reduce the physical pain, are seen as euthanasia and are subject to the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the area of the Law of health have already expressed their reservations in connection with the findings of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in Health Law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who have signed the report because, among other things, is not restricted the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
The specialist in Health Law Margaret Somerville also expressed its "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which he called a "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questioned the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President al-Assad to leave power
Damascus complaint a "plot"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, with the support of Russia, the reluctant and claim that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have spoken out in favour of the abandonment of power by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader who requested the President Bashar al-Assad to "relinquish power" in Syria, where they have already died a quarantine of civilians and members of the forces of the regime.
"If Bashar is really concerned for his country, he should resign, in addition to create the conditions for a new phase of political life in Syria," said the King of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has complained that mediation efforts now in Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can not meet them go," he declared, referring to Syria, a neighbour with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that it has "reinforced the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tough tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, have already killed 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the region of Deraa in the south of Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory OSDH (Human rights).
Two other civilians have died in bombings and shootings "with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Mualem Al, for its part, believes that the country is "moving towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus of their functions, which in its view constituted "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not waver," he added, ensuring that "the cooked plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently considering a "mechanism of protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the dispatch of observers of the UN to help protect civilians against the regime's repression that, in his view, is placed in the "paranoia".
It is scheduled to hold a special meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat to bring about the implementation of the plan of exit from the crisis, adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has tried yesterday as a "flawed" decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan of exit from the crisis, but not expressed its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti called time on the markets and sacrifices Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time for markets to form his team and put in place a programme which will include "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should be a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad agenda with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups parliamentarians who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
For its part, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, has said he hopes that Mario Monti requests before Friday, a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new Government has enough support.
The consultation will end with the presentation by Mr Monti, a limited list, certainly a dozen Ministers, the head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, calling them time.
"Democracy, there are some precise deadlines" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "confident that the markets have patience and understand this."
His appointment by President initially received the blessing of the markets, but then imposed the concern, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team consisting mainly of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would include "political".
The new Government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, believes.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before the Friday.
Monti has pledged to work when it takes office, taking into account the urgency and with the goal of Italy "regain its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn has stressed that "even with a new Government, would not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted during the past months, has called for the adoption of new measures of rigour.
"The head of the Chiefs' Italians Emma Marcegaglia, that he would kill, it also stressed the need to boost the economy," as a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements in terms of deficit. "
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconismo"; "Professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorial.
The big question will be the longevity of his team.
The President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place before April 2012 about $200 billion in obligations of State.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program.
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used in a nuclear weapon, according to the American NGO Monday, a specialist at the nuclear risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and in other documents issued by the Agency of the UN.
The IAEA said last week its "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, drawing extensively in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a military nuclear facility in Tcheliabinsk Oural (Soviet) and have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led to contact in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
After that, it is believed that cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says that "there are strong indications that Iran is developing a system of" nuclear detonation "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only know the technique, but also, as reported by one Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in the technology in the military nuclear programme of their country of origin."
The crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by 50 per cent
The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the other types of racial and religious violence has decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., has increased by 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in the crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and offences anti-religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly 6.628 until the cases, of which a 47.3 percent is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that have returned to increase this type of crimes and offences", highlighted the human rights organisation Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," The organization said in a statement.
"The Human Rights First has long noting that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," said an official of the Organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US Government can and must strive to end such abuse," he adds, considering that these efforts could include an improvement of police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the US federal law is inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
That legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to the race, colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and resembles Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site changed on Monday, the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activity of those who remain, which means that its service would seem a little more to the Facebook.
A new "pestaña activity" and other so-called "name" may continue legiblemente and more direct in the activity of other "Twittos" - that is, those surfers whose messages ("tweets") remains on the Internet or that you follow you.
This makes it possible to know if they give up on messages, if you pay for new accounts, if any message as favourite, etc.
This new formula of Twitter was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading to the rest of the network on Monday, has indicated to AFP the spokesman of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which is known for its operation little instinctive, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message of another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le, s'ouvre initiés bonheur des ainsi at a public plus maniement plus a large avec celui des comparable to Facebook et réseaux grand public Google+.
In the network, users have discussed a coup of "tweets" with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, it is intrusive and too similar to Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The role Activity will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "Golden Rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of grand coalition Social Democrat / Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "Golden Rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign Note of Austria by the rating agencies (triple A).
It was the same Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the upper limit of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If you reduce the solvency of Austria on one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay $3 billion more in interest each year," said Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to member countries of the euro zone for the past 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or an Act with equivalent value.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt that kind of "rule".
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease each year at 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, beginning in 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal State should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while regional states and municipalities, should submit balanced budgets.
The aim is that, in 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threat with a new market intervention of change
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again the marked change if the yen continues to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we see that there is an" excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach around the historic highs that led to the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the US currency.
But the yen has been increasing steadily since then, driven by purchases of investors who view it as a "safe haven" value in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar again been listed on Tuesday at less than 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic Bar of 105 yen, reaching a level close to those who caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro in more than 160 yen.
This explosion of Japan's currency hurts exports of the archipelago, which encourages the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of overseas earnings for Japanese companies when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the region of Tohoku (North-East), highlighted Noda, which fears that the rise of the yen cut because of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained the growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday of a two-day meeting of its Board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institution, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that we should not expect greater currency flexibility on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emissions increased by five trillion yen ($47 billion euros) their purchases of Treasury bills, driving the $55 trillion yen (519,000 million euros) the threshold of the money spent on the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the market with liquidity.
The euro area:
Types grow, stock markets falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is hurting the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of countries continue to rise further weakened.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink in a little more negative area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and is at 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions in connection with the yield on loans from the euro area States most affected, stock markets around the world are paying part of their recent gains."
"investors, nervous, are well aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent, renewing the concerns of the interveners of the market in connection with Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue to be carried out in a margin of small changes, so that investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of the concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 p.m., the European currency   worth 1,3570   dollars, a fall of 0.4%.
According to traders, has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU, which met on Monday in the Congress, to adopt a motion which provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty coming out of the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit types of Italy and Spain remain some disturbing levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in connection with interest rates of the countries of the South, but also of France, continue to fuel fears of conductors.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has called time on the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being smothered under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, has claimed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of the eurozone on 27 October would be the "primary task" of his Government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, while the Sunday's legislative elections will be held there.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of the growth figures for the euro zone
From a statistical point of view, France has seen an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e., a figure more favourable than the 0.3 per cent, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in place of a stalemate.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has seen a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecast for the whole of the eurozone   to 11 hours, after which the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts are worth more than the dogmas
If there is an issue that can not be treated in light of short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate that an electoral event is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base its opinion on objective facts, in sound data.
Now we are seven billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean duplication of the electric demand before 2050, unless it deprives a huge part of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, we will have to address the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
That is not the case in Belgium, which subjects himself to the need to find a source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, that only objective is to build plants in the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit at the Park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, sometimes as an example, the reality is against this speech.
The choice of Berlin will mean a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, including Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal.
In a few months, it was felt the harmful effects.
We must think about the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the wind industry, which gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the French households.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undercut realism to the wonderful statements on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and create jobs that can not deslocalizables.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMES and the loss of $6 billion per year in exports of French nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician responsible an APR designed to function sixty years, when it is expected that the collapse of its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is a miraculous source of electricity production, like there is a diabolical source.
The development by Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementary nature of the sources of energy.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is imperative to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority which exercises strict control and transparent on both existing plants as the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions, causing no consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was caused by the design of the reactor and some human error unforgivable.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German manufacturers and operators, the RPA presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While the study all electrical players who wish to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for competitors from Areva and EDF, because that would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and manoeuvring dominasen a partisan debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative subjected to political figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who had come to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters."
However, rarely discusses from an economic point of view.
The issue is that, on this issue, there is considerable consensus between left and right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidelines stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard, explaining that France "can not handle all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, it is believed that immigrants are a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the level of generosity with which they operate with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the "co-development will solve the problem of migration."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is electorally profitable, but economically goes very expensive.
As economists point Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 pp), there is a broad consensus among scientists about the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration hurts weakening growth and employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace national workers, especially for the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for national workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where the formation does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would struggle to work in a country with a lack of anaesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes that the arrival of recent positive difference in wages and employment of nationals.
In light of the foregoing, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows presents a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that bring immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth, there is a large proportion of Nobel laureates naturalized Americans and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less cost) of 150,000 euros in public budgets of average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek points of growth that he lacked "teeth".
These teeth, who dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, you only need to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember that because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years, throughout the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, Colonels in Greece.
Some may believe that democracy triunfase definitively on their enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, it is not enough by itself and might even become a tool of oppression, "as stated in the old Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a control and a separation of powers, an education, positive, solidarity, economic and social justice.
The current crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political crisis and democratic.
The Greek referendum palinodia verdadero-falso had, in this regard, revealing a double effect: it showed the need for a strong return from the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of the impossibility of his inconsistency.
We must reflect on this ambivalence to overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been moved, and that, in many cases, the soldiers because Republicans are not moving in the right direction.
It will not be won if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of need and in a disorderly manner.
A blank cheque to the European absolute monarch or a high vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to get beaten, but a joint exercise, fully-fledged, calm and continuous, options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is No crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would know where they end up the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is bowing to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is a humiliation in the international arena.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of their nations.
The most urgent need is to regain popular sovereignty over the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free from markets and prepare for the future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that may not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having long struggled against this proposal from the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now a European economic governance.
So be it.
But think about it without further political integration and democratic, and without that is experienced as such by the citizens, it would be a new madness and lead us to a new stalemate.
We must assume a new phase of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
That lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It will only be possible to build a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us Europeans.
The cards with chip without contact "spread"
The Hall of the global chip cards began Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic mood.
Indeed, the year 2011 should end with an 11 per cent increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, mobile phones and SIM cards, etc.), with a total of $6 million units, according to estimates by the Cabinet Eurosmart.
The segment is the most powerful technology without contact, which allows the joint transportation or purchases simply approaching the card at a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year.
Its quota should continue to rise in 2012 (includes 580 million units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for cards with chip 6,925 million (card).
Europe, which has long been left behind in the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the sector of the payment without contact.
Some 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: they are using 400,000 Visa cards without contact.
But the supermarkets work by four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million cards MasterCard Pass without contact.
To get the gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to its customers.
"There are two big French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate in the future, among its clients, bank cards with the system without contact," said Gérard Nébouy, general Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove payment via mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with technology NFC (Near Field Communication), essential to conduct transactions.
"are falling behind."
"but should finally experience a real boom in the coming year."
"We anticipate that it will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 throughout the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped with about 200 customers and partners with a foundation that allows the payment without contact.
It has a similar project BPCE in Strasbourg and Marseille.

Of the Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) had appeared as well and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which have long suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even Algiers has already stated that "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by persons associated with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day, along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of callers indicated by several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly attracted the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other by a man who, presumably, is near Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an achievement, but surely we should expect to own more formal evidence before speaking of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial support and intellectual outside and which is increasingly active," says Nigerian Kunle Amuwo, an investigator.
In recent months, these "props" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational methods, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex, and in the same style than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington is pressuring Muscat since to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to view the group as a community of theorists unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and a fundamentalist Imam, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, hausa (which means "Western education is a sin"), to encourage the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the Association is experiencing a rapid success.
Politicization and requires a strict adherence to sharia law, while its militants took to the fight against the infidel central Government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, pubs, administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were particularly active and multiplied attacks against the police.
The reaction of Muscat was, as so often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the town and there were 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalizing and abandon their fiefdoms in the north.
Last Christmas, claiming an attack that cause 80 killed in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram returned to attack against Muscat, in particular against the headquarters protected by the police, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal.
The creation of an axis terrorist in Africa, from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, unsettling all specialists in security.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that Somalis Al-Chebab of operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all information."
The world according to Republican candidates for the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in naivety and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is.
In the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been increasingly estruendosas statements and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Extend the slogans, often infundamentados on China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination by the Grand Old Party, has threatened to bring the Chinese before the WTO and report them "by manipulating its currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of fragments of the entire sector towards Asia.
As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former Ambassador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that "apabulla" emotions.
He has asked for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, want to Iran," fanfarroneó.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with their obligations under that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the candidate with the second best classified, for its part, shows a shameful lack of such items.
Recently, urging a counterbalance to the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to develop nuclear capability ", apparently ignoring the fact that China is already available to the military atom since 1964.
tejano Governor Rick Perry, who supported Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, said that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US army in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, as advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
There are considerable differences with the Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President replied that Reagan was also simple ideas and we won the Cold War.
Recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They insist, quite rightly, in the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit from the "guys" of Iraq and in their misrepresentations in Libya, and labeled as weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population judges of a rather positive balance of national security of Obama, who finished with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, distrust of military interventions that generate a collapse.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must provide gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra bufet and a delicate, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the Sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have revolved together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, each year will arrive   27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional to Western Europe via a first took of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of   $55 million cubic metres of gas, i.e., enough to cover the entire French consumption.
Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of constructing a third tube for the same journey.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries were firmly opposed to the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will provide gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of its power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to shut him access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet Pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, to support the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a gap between Europeans in East and West.
Russia has known in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct partnership between Russia and Western countries rich, big consumers of gas and with some reservations increasingly limited.
"this pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organic form," confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating how big contracts in the gas sector are as much political as economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The tube submarine is made of laminated steel, cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.
It supports in the bottom of the Sea, at an average of 200 metres.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precautionary measure," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
It was necessary to step up the protection of wildlife.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: either by valves, nor by seasons of maintenance.
He was provided a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced the same to see that the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state-owned company was established on a permanent basis in the sea off its coast.
"In the event of failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of the escape, the gas pipeline, therefore, will be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider unlikely that there will be an escape, since they have planned junturas, which is expected to have an escape from 100,000 years.
The control of the State of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged down by a ship, which carries out field inspections, as well as through a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on potential distortions of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any kind of redress.
The movement of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.
The principle is 200 bars and, out of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to undertake this project.
The company leader is Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the shares.
It joined the German E. ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch and the French group Gasunie GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
With its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented to the company, during a period of 25 years, the whole of renewable transport capabilities of gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the input of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach $7.4 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached $240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure not to exceed its investment, because Gazprom assumes alone the risk of expenditure.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, in a sandy coast of planted Pines.
Some valves, with 4.5 metres in height, form the exit door of the gas.
There are few sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine notebook, a brand.
Created a half-century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to send people a taste for the script.
Has a whiff of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The book, Moleskine is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pasta, its rubber sheets, their white ears, as aging at the time.
However, with the current aspect Moleskine notebooks were born in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to throw the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
By that time, Maria Sebregondi consulting company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, the huge amount of mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton barnizado used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an object old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century," account Maria Sebregondi, since he became responsible for the brand in Mode mode.
And it reached the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has been the production of confidential early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to   70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, and open spirit cults.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its inception, now owns nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
Circulated their notebooks in bookstores, since the Fnac until the small shops in the city centre, and has managed to impose their identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists put his own book.
In August, also launched a notebook with covers of leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Building on its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: handbags, notebooks, pens, covers of computer... the brand encompasses a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the Investment Fund, GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?
About 19 percent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a strong public policy, implemented since 2005, the rate of unemployment among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
Is Desalentadora?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, general Manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"the progress achieved since fifteen years are considerable.
"at that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still much to be done."
It is worth mentioning that unemployed persons with disabilities continue to face many obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to have older: 37 percent has over 50 years (17% on average).
With a low level of qualification: 80% had not finished high school, and   2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38 percent of average.
That is, there are many issues that impede especially the return to the world of work, "which constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, general Manager of Tremplin, a partnership founded in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.
These are the obstacles objectives.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mindset of the people, but it is moving too slowly.
A survey conducted in April by the Association for the Cité IMS-Entreprendre noted that managers surveyed have "a level of knowledge on disability under" with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual."
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are   very far from the goal of recruiting a 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in an Act of 1987....
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%.
"now reached around 3 per cent," says Pierre Blanc, general Manager of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law.
The evidence: the number of establishment "under this provision," as the amounts disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from $59 to 46,000 structures and 606 (480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, in particular among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 percent of companies that have between 20 and 49 employees with disabled employees on its payroll, compared to 82% of businesses between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "a joy."
About to face the Tuesday evening Bleus 20h45 (), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens not conceal the pleasure that creates this friendly match.
We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually done the hatchet.
Five months after the gesture of resentment of his STRIKER against Turkey, the Belgian team had only praise for him.
"I am very pleased by Eden, by their progress and because a Belgian."
"I want to move," he replied STRIKER of Lille.
With regard to the contrast between their presentations in his team and in the selection, "as a whole", has been justified.
"in Lille, I am all year, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to put myself."
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes at Saint-Denis, finally, for "shine".
We must not forget the "pleasure".
Leads to encourage Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been a fan," he said.
Without doubt, this will strengthen especially "particular" of the event.
Especially because they will face "to Mathieu Debuchy () (), Yohan Cabaye (and Adil Rami)," he recalls.
"We have just face recently.
"playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has done its part by reference to the "pride".
"pride" replay "at a gala party."
"pride" is also seen as a "neighbour", that France "becomes a team of very high level", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would love to be able to share with the plane Bleus towards... Brazil in 2014.
"our small Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You can see it in the next few games." including the match against France.
Portugal shows much confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento is faced with a great optimism for the return against 22h00 (Bosnia), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party ticket, they lacked realism to both teams.
"When you run these 90 minutes, we will be a successful team and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
No doubt Selecçao; the, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal   of happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the match 0-0 (one-way), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not resolved.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given the tranquillity.
"It is a good result, but at the same time carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the light of the Stadium View in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that pass, before an audience that should be equally excited, even if it is clear that the Party is "very matched," dixit Bento an optimistic but lucid.
"We hope that the Party is well matched, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," declared the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", has, however, seen in the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The tie on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosniaks could get a tie, but also need to score.
"It is a good result, but at the same time carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home, Bento regrets."
"We are going to play against a team that has a high technical quality and provides players with a great individual quality," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the outset, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave no time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time, is realistic.
