A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the fraud.
The latter, the brennan Center for a myth, as it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada are the States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration or complicate the ballot box.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.
As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters have photo ID and proof of us-staatsbürgerschaft present.
Furthermore, these laws also shortened the period for the early vote, denied the right to register as voters on election day, declared invalid and citizens of the right to vote, for which a gerichtsakte vorliegt.
Before the elections of 2006 has no us-staat required by the voters, produce a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state, has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in 2008 of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years they promoted in 34 States draft laws, with which the voters be forced to produce a photo ID.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ausweiskarte as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the citizens, i.e. 21 million wahlberechtigte people no identification issued by a government of their state.
In addition, five million neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to receive the necessary ID.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are regarded as voters who cast their vote vermehrt for democratic candidates in several countries, it is not allowed to use their identification issued by its creation.
On the other hand, these same states will allow members of fishing or jagdvereinen, choose the more for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state for the select asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, the voters demand that your us-staatsbürgerschaft nachweisen.
These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states have laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
They have also restricted the right of individuals and groups, we provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to voter registration in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other States passed laws that aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
For instance, in the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same is true for the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of voters were, only 46% of the electorate, the chose in advance.
Of course, opposed the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the veto of the democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They could limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States passed laws that reveal demand of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted in and see them as a clear aims to influence the 2012 results in the crucial states.
A 2011 report from the brennan center shows that those states that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes represent the wahlmännergremium are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States.
prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: should be made the test or not?
The psa-test way in fact sometimes incorrect results, with false negative, but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to more hesitation the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two medical specialists obtained.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that, when a nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood the formation of Metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
For men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient must be shown the extent of the risk of its cancer really made clear by him the possible options, where prostatakrebse untreated, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases rather opting for an active monitoring of the disease.
For many men, in which you have cancer detected, no treatment place today because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring and offers you a treatment in progression of the disease.
We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who does not.
That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for urology movember has developed an instrument, with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of psa-tests.

Prevention the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough.
"if there were no more smokers, this would value at least 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian krebsgesellschaft.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously damages the health of people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian krebsgesellschaft fördern overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm- mastdarm- speiseröhren- bauchspeicheldrüsen- and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life against grimmdarmkrebs protects," he adds.
The food
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In too much of it increases the risk of developing a grimm- bzw. mastdarmkrebs.
meats should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by räuchern, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic.
"the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But their investigations are currently not conclusive.
After the Canadian krebsgesellschaft are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.
During a study the reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another more of an increase.
shown the effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not yet clear.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family vorbelastung.
"the implementation of a früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer."
The higgs-boson analysed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the higgs-bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
We believe in fact that this boson in nothing less than the mechanism is involved, who is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And it is, after all, the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted, but empirically has not been observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the standard model predicted higgs-boson strongly resembles.
Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week on a large physik-kongress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to agree to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we expect that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is a low risk to deceive, and we take a look at what it is about.
In this world there is a necessarily unumgängliches law meant that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to break this rule - and try not to strong, because they will hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli'sche ausschlussprinzip that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, when they are in the same "quantenzustand" and the "state" largely consists of some of its properties.
On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, which are called fermione and artig obey the pauli-prinzip.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact in the same place at the same time.
The particle adventure these bosons are grouped according to the website of the BERKELEY laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "kraftteilchen spread," by the great forces of nature and with which the higgs-boson somehow would be used.
It has to be stressed, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as expected.
If you are able to read these chronik, then only thanks to a bosons uitzonderlijke banality: the photon, or the "lichtteilchen," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge up or change the direction," disrupted "the electromagnetic field that is in this place, like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolettstrahlung etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "carrier of the force."
stabileres field
The same applies to the higgs-boson, with the difference that a different field, the higgs-feld, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows.
However, the higgs-feld much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock zerfurcht could be.
A giant particle accelerator as CERN is therefore necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the same higgs-feld: those who do, have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research now "may well be" asks Mrs plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the standardmodells (sm), and also enable physicists to look closely at all the variations between the observations and predictions of sm.
There are also many physicists, the eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and the model plug some holes.
It has to be said that the latter is great shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the schwerkraft (ups!) and the dark matter, ups, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again!).
However, the CERN derartige abweichungen not found until now.
impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-laboren not suspected that their work would cause such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the bell labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "laborspielerei".
Imagine...
applications also can also arise from all the instruments, surrounded the research.
For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the look a small light sensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras around the world today as "eye" and introduced him 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really never know it can...
palliativpflege - the best way to die... | Le devoir
With your committee for "Death with Dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of lebensendes.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, is still a lot to do in this important area.
Le devoir has tried to look more closely at this.
A few weeks ago lebte Mr L. still alone in his apartment in The montérégie.
The prostate cancer, aufzehrte him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed," he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois in beloeil liegend, in which he arrived on the previous day.
"however, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from running alone to go to the bathroom and even to eat.
sitting at the table before a tasty lunch, he resigniert agrees to help eat.
brave succeed him even to smile and to speak with the foreign, working around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"in the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt," says Pierre brodeur, psychologe victor-gadbois at the home.
Return to the kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person to take a step backwards," he notes.
Because according to several people who work in the palliativpflege, find big events in the midst of this backward steps.
The patients in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois eingewiesen, are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage you will by the doctors and nurses who care about you, no longer showered with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear," deliberately and by erstickung "to die.
But by the disease I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wish more in life," she says, before you accept that you set up a mask that helps her breathe.
They expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, who is from Italy.
At the home victor-gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers care and assistance in the food.
The palliativpflege will be used, if there are no other options more.
To the deaths more pleasant.
In Quebec, on 11.700 inhabitants a bed for the palliativpflege.
This is very little, if you take into account that one day we all will die.
Here is the live under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. christiane neustrie, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying according to a mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar level.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer served, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken.
"We help relatives and patients alike," berichtet pflegedirektorin Nathalie savard.
At the home victor-gadbois is not a day as the others.
In addition, an old man of 93 of the last familienzusammenkunft in court, and well supported by his pillow, while his honor anstößt, a young man dies of 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"for six months, three to five beds are always with cancer patients aged less than 45 years belegt shares," Dr. christiane neustrie concerned with.
53% of the home victor-gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
problem of access to palliativpflege
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no special access to palliative care, i.e. to care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home victor-gadbois and the society for domestic palliativpflege in the greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This is the big flaw in the healthcare quebecs ensures that several palliativpflege specialized doctors look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
for the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliativpflege as Dr. Balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. christiane neustrie, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to quality palliativpflege have accepted, before we move on to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was, without having taken measures to their relief.
I fear that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And, at the same time several oncologists treat their patients despite schlimmster forecasts verbissen until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has aborted a difficult chemotherapy.
As I told my onkologin, that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I abandons the fight, told you.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotente care
Dr. neustrie believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, thank the staff that it has not granted this request, after their pain from a team of palliativpflege have been arrested.
But it must be made clear that the palliativpflege in the schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent.
After elsie monereau, head of the society of the domestic palliativpflege palliativpflege 8% of patients not to speak in the greater Montreal area a schmerzbehandlung.
At the very end of life are the doctors, often back to the terminals sedation, the gist of which the patients either sporadic or permanently until the date of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity, in this terminale sedation zurückzugreifen.
Patients whose pain not be soothed, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean," I want them to be eased without me," but "I want to see my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalismusstipendiums Canadian gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec
officials of the bauhauptgewerbes straßenbauamtes, businesses, geldbeschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia erzählen every day, what you know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed.
A "industry," the Quebec was very expensive for the taxpayer, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since then it has taken drastic measures," witzelt Jacques duchesneau, a Member in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was exposed by him because a thorough investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties to straßenbauarbeiten in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed.
The "duchesneau-bericht" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he said, "if only the Transport Ministry saved a billion dollars to the Treaties," because some zügelten in their instinct to get their share.
The charbonneau-kommission "has already brought two mayors to case," he adds, in the hope that it succeeds, "the tactics behind the individuals show."
launched a 2011, permanent antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011 launched, permanent antikorruptionseinheit proposeth identify with their troops to auditors, and analysts of the government also great efforts.
Also the police the "marteau-truppe", which since 2009 has ensured that the "kanalisationskartell" by Montreal in the artificial inflation of treaties zurückhaltender going on...
In recent weeks it has lined up house raids and made accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as frank tampino and Richard marcotte erhoben, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles vaillancourt, has resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third largest city.
He is suspected of, in exchange for public procurement repeatedly to have received bribes.
Specifically, engineers were accused of straßenbauamts of Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission has declared the operation of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the mediator in Montreal erhaltenen contracts to in touch with the Mafia, paid the Montreal gave the money to the Union, the party of mayors gérald tremblay.
Mr zambito he has had his hand in the game throughout the 2000s, by more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) gave to provinzparteien, especially at the time in power formerly-known-as liberals.
He also admitted, an illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie normandeau organized.
kanalisationsverträge, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
worked in Montreal the "system" of corruption smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles surprenant this has described in detail: in ten years before the Commission he received from contractors to travel gifts, uitnodigingen golf-turnieren, restaurants and eishockey-spielen, and bribes in return for $736.000 kanalisationsverträge, whose cost it artificially aufblähte.
Other officials of the straßenbauamtes have admitted that they are schmieren ließen, by the bills with false zusatzleistungen artificially aufblähten by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr tremblay, that he deliberately on a schattenhaushalt has overlooked its coffers with schwarzgeld filled.
As a result of these revelations is Mr tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which Montreal crashed into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm schlug.
As mayor of stadtbezirks rivière-des-prairies, in the east of the island, they rebelled against the sale of gemeindegrundstücks that acquired for $5 million in 2010 and for 1.6 million was sold to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% schwarzgeld in the election campaigns
of the study, carried out at the end of the day, she says that they are "on a thread that allows the operation of ants unterwanderten system to understand, in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure was "painful, but positive."
We are going to clean the wound, however, need a certain ermittlungseinheit only for Montreal, and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
We clean power.
Regular.
Jacques duchesneau seinerseits notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "officials who are aware of the tactics," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% share of jewelry in the financing of campaigns in Quebec witzelt he: "I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit the donations to parties at $100, which will not be strictly limited, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "as long as the wahlkampfausgaben schwarzgeld in politics in circulation."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the funding of parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage on the bottom, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal damages, calls on Mr duchesneau those who laugh, to take a look in their own backyard.
"psg is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have with psg a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of psg erklären.
Great players have come.
Every day I do on your side progress.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my spielniveau.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football, everything is very quickly.
But I breche not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF clairefontaine until my season in saint-etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of thus introduced by Carlo ancelotti competition...
The latest additions this summer are accustomed to win games is very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo ancelotti much in relation to my spielposition.
He is supported by co-trainern as Claude makelele, who played in the same position as me.
ancelotti is the right person for the job?
,.
ancelotti flößt all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious vereinen.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of psg?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of the spitzenreiters Lyon us.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the first knockout round in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we are against very good European teams have our say.
First of all we want to first of our group in Porto, so that we can complete the second leg of the achtelfinales as home.
Can the psg in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget for...
In order to be a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for himself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially is the psg the resources, so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, this title abzusahnen.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory davonzutragen.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally should be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux to win the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff to him.
Do you think that the media too much of the psg expect?
In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we in a home game against troyes 4-0 win, and it still is, something you can accuse us, this is certainly something frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We try to set up a concept.
A team builds up over time.
shown in the Champions League we have strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons is unable to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge spending.
In terms of the sums invested believed you to spielpause with 15 points ahead!
This means that our opponents and ignored the French championship would.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not good, from this new psg "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling winner and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties.
The psg seems completely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic abhängig to be.
So much the better, that speaks of a "zlatan-abhängigkeit."
This means that Ibrahimovic is really powerful and scores many goals.
That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done, is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their spielniveau.
thiago Silva, is one of the world's best defenders, allows all other also to make progress.
As you have seen the 2012 with the French national team?
As disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in this em.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented from something playing herauszuschlagen.
I have seen things there, emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today it was me to achieve good games in the national team.
This was for my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The nationaltrainer is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its aim, by he had qualified for the European championships.
I hope that Didier deschamps the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
is on 16 October in Spain forced unentschieden (1:1), a auftaktspiel?

Everyone has used for all the other.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
With bitcoin pay and sell without bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies is a political vision greifbar: the belief that the current, of bankmonopolen designed monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, this is of satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange like bittorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions recorded.
Several thousand webseiten accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, before he has recovered today to around $10 to $2 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in relation to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that you win or play with (and sometimes zurücktauschen) can buy.
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority and each time bearbeitet.
With bitcoin are all netzknoten gleichzeitig repositories of the rechnungsbuchs, auditors, geld-emittenten and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for every payment, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of the associated with this transaction data will electronically through a double verschlüsselungssystem signed.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded in the entire network widespread rechnungsbuch of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task which started on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary zentralbankier, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole "zerhackt."
The goal is to find that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning) ergibt.
If this number was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions verknüpft, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat Two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is no link, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has resolved the task, gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a hundertmillionstel teilbar, what makes some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin, have been attacked and the bitcoin-einlagen stolen.
"The vulnerability is not the actual minutes used," assured Pierre noizat just paymium has introduced, this is a company with real money for the payment and the network bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
major players such as Wikipedia verweigern donations of this kind.
By others such as the blog-plattform wordpress will accept them.
Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel rechnungsbuch analyses and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-schlussverkauf" started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon holmquist is pleased, who works for the company coinabul the bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as transaktionsnetzwerk.
His system paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that it is cheaper.
In addition, manages the owner's identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in the traders, and the latter must no new terminals or install computer programs.
You just need an address, a phone "can be photographed and identified", is Pierre noizat plyuk, assured that he has thousands of users.
There, it is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal ausgerichteter systems be reconsidered.
"It will take some time before bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, the various today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success to revalue the currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa and surobi).
NATO and the United States should at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army takes the possession of territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future without all of us to expect.
In particular, we have the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and versehrten.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their jahrhundertealten and archaic traditions, even if you jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined.
toleriert, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there, if the western countries are discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in nijrab, I have observed by a with almond bepflanzten Hill, with the help of French loans was financed erfolgte properly.
The helicopters überflogenen lastwagen- and panzer-konvois have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no einströmen more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
Then, Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various aufrührerischen groups covered by the war.
Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to the security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the organization al-Qaeda überwältigten farmers until now, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a position of inferiority.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war are 2001 come to power again.
They have transformed into geschäftemacher by land seized the government, in order to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and so benefit from the massive American subcontracting zogen.
They have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who could take advantage of the American benefits: the flight is considerable.
filled the young people have the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
about 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the population.
In the cities are the state schools full of girls as young.
These young people who either the obscurantism of the former parties still to corruption certain executives want to return, we will have to provide jobs.
All parties, including the armed, are obsessed with mobile phones, watched the Television with his Turkish series, the modern world, is everywhere.
An army is now available.
Are the authorities, under whose authority you will be regarded as legitimate?
former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which is the power of the central administration.
Afghanistan, the country's mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister since the 1964 constitution was, the United States wanted to make him a centralised State with a strong präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially at the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s and already long before dependent on foreign aid.
industries have not been rebuilt, functional stauwerke are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables is produced nothing.

In a country that was devastated by 30 years of war, would be a state control of infrastructure have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan immense natural resources did.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to make its.
Without energy to process the eisen- or kupfererz on site, or no mining is possible without means of transport for the export of the mountains.
The Chinese have the kupfermine of MES Aynak already almost, I leave the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the major employers in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new Cooperation Agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girl and jungengymnasien, Institute for French at the universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "zivil-militärischer actions" of the Ministry of Defence (cimic), was set in 2012, many charitable work in dozens of villages and measures to clean up the agriculture and carried out by a small French nichtregierungsorganisation hold, in order to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciliation of aid and offensive actions.
This work, for the many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the insurgency: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.

A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, these are often at an altitude of more than 2000 metern liegenden tälern very hard.
In the message, dozens of written questions of small projects of communities of the province kapisa eingegangen.
So that the farmers get rid of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which say that their own your wish is, you would be the continuation of low, well controlled and directly relevant civilian aid needed for their benefit.
A constitution with the brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed mursi.
While Egypt in terms of the verfassungserklärung it temporarily the unlimited authority granted remains divided, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.
Just a week ago, the Head of State this House granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger divisions in the country.
For his opponents remains the President in his "autocratic delirium," adding he continued "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters assured you that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
within 14 days should a referendum will be held.
A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to abandon their plan, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
It is also a way for the President, his public and democratic legitimacy of action during the protest raging across the country.
After bekräftigungen in an interview with the American wochenschau time seems to be Mohammed mursi convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Especially as the Egyptian people vote with this recourse to a hasty vote will put an ultimatum: "Either you for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should supposedly put an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals is not fulfilled the request.
Shortly before the verfassungserklärung mid November, they have turned away, as they are of the opinion that they have not been able to bring to bear, their views.
representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the civil society have acted similarly.
To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy Members, added.
Some are the moslembrüdern retentie.
It is not surprising that the article meistens adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, incidentally, that the only difference of the day... in the time for prayer is expressed, as some members of the board were of the opinion that the grandfather clock, the constituent assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, paragraph 2, drew all the attention, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The salafistischen parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good intentions and for your respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" say the Liberals, who see this only as propagandaschlag.
Because, according to them, is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
You have particularly Article 220 zuerkennt a consultative role in the eye, of the University of al-Azhar, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the ägyptenspezialistin Sophie pommier this is worrying, because "the people who have been asked for an opinion, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also fed by the fact that the next rector of the university will be much less moderate than the current.
"there is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not ulema, but scholars who have been trained to become part of the French system," Alexis blouet appeased, the writing a thesis about the Egyptian verfassungstransition.
He but acknowledges that "in relation to the Article 220 can have a ambiguity, because the terms used the religious vocabulary are based.
It relates in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, shops. red.].
And in the future could be raised the question to what extent zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers, which he granted the President of the Republic.
The moslembrüder argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military is the examination of the defense budget not presented to Parliament, but a National Defence Council.
As there will be no ban on civil cases in military courts, as the associations have called for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with you as the freiheitsbedrohend ansehen.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, and could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Furthermore, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines heba morayef by Human Rights Watch.
Your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will be Saturday aufmarschieren.

In the city they come mostly by bus in Jerusalem, but there is also a schnellstraßenbahn ahead and the country's only u-bahn-linie in Haifa with six stations, which connects the lower with the upper town.

"the great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members and civil rights activist, discuss the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act already with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each arbeitsmigrant tells a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, drop it.
So far this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.
However, should the tests with time, according to federal migrationsbehörde in future for all workers to be compulsory.
In this context, we must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and to the foundations of the legislation.
sprachkenntnisse must both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit be proved.
exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
also exempt from this legislation are people who have received their ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
sense, problems and protecting the rights
The whole of the prüfungsstellen, under the aegis of the puschkin-instituts for the Russian language, the Russian university völkerfreundschaft, of Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other universities are.
The migrants can store the tests in all the cities; already have already been more than 160 entsprechende centers opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal migrationsbehörde.
civil rights activist, stellten prior to the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what is this all about?
What changes is the provision to sprachkenntnisse show, both for the Russians, as well as for guest workers?
Above all, counter the migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the delegation of the federal migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor sebelew.
Their rights must be protected, however, before their departure.
Only organised rekrutierung will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical observation.
sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without sprachkenntnisse inevitably people with bad intentions, put it under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow building, where he will meet with dozens seinesgleichen months without food and documents will endure schuften and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"in the home, you will be the one promised, and on arrival you cheated to get their passports taken and not receive the promised reward," confirms the head of the headquarters for migration of the Tajik migrationsbehörde tolib schwaripow.
not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia want to earn their money, that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not your fault, so much as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks, can also make a sensible primary education.
Because there are not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them a decent clothes, shoes and schulsachen.
As a teenager take these children then the first opportunity to making money. immediately
"It is difficult without sprachkenntnisse," you are.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status for.
You have this status not, so there is no investigation and, therefore, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
banned "welcome" or "access for unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also the legalisierung costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Make a fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely gefaelscht and we are not registered, and it will create cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," is the tadschike umed huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the sprachtests bescheinigen, have already been by employees of the federal migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers were printed with a normal color.
Of course, the new owners this not in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document siebentausend rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official review: this costs a arbeitsmigranten three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights activist agree.
For the moment the authorities can immigrant workers covered by the test for the first time, only promise that you get time for a sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, newcomers without sprachkenntnisse posts in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
innenministerium ignored illegal arms market
share of legal weapons to crimes very low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the waffengesetzes for private waffenbesitzer.
that the authorities in response to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the punishment of the Moscow lawyers Dmitri winogradow.
The police wants to wear the nicht-tödlicher weapons ban in public and raise the age from 18 to 21 years for the possession of firearms.
The proposal, the chairman of the security and the fight against corruption, Irina duma-ausschusses jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the waffengesetz shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attraction of the screws."
The Internet was published an open letter, the author - representatives of various waffenverbände - call to refrain from taking "senseless verschärfungen" by the authorities.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the strafrechtler wasilij lesnikow, the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the interior ministry were 142 committed crimes in 2012 with use of registered weapons in the course of six months, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law on private waffenbesitzer criminals will not stop, on the black market to use.
Now you can find any weapon for little money in Moscow, according to the authors.
Meanwhile, the Ministry stressed that the prevalence of illegal weapons is under control.
suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The arms are on multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such hauptkanäle, says a former Colonel Viktor baranez, 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff worked.
screenshot of a website, the waffenbestellungen s.259-290
The first channel is the army or the military, in other words weapons, which were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers and the kaukasiern themselves," says baranez stolen.
On the second channel clandestine weapons, the ordnungshütern are stolen by criminals.
baranez explained that these weapons conter, who both have been stolen from the waffenkammern police as well as directly by employees of law enforcement agencies.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military waffenlagern.
With many militärlagern there was often to explosions.
"There is evidence that it was arson, in some cases in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military.
make a contribution to the black market in accordance with baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and therefore not withstand the weapons under the hand on the black market, such as in Moscow, dump," reports the expert.
Another channel of the schwarzmarkts is smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a dedicated, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, which organised the smuggling," explained the former military.
Where the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supply of schwarzmarkts with illegal arms around.
Written in 2011, a report from the centre for problemanalysen and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the interior ministry and the Federal State statistics service, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, from the army and the rechtsschutzbehörden.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "debt of leaders, in their work with weapons to do it," says the report.
According to the data, the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% back to thefts in the production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A verkaufsberater a waffenladens, does not want to be named, assured that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, long nobody buys, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supply in a waffenlager.
On a Ensign is a weapon, for example, type TT, bought a gun.
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.
"the dealer is the weapon in the city and sells them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know, of course, all aware and, therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodically kontrollkäufe dealers offer by the illegal weapons," adds the verkaufsberater.
"as in the luxusladen"
Buyers and sellers will find most on known to each other.
I had seen websites and blogs, as someone was aware of me and I suggested to the station "begowaja to come," where a person would wait for me, which I would in a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the weapon I learned only there
militärkommentator Viktor baranez
"to get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the verkaufsberater. "I have as a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but we must go there and with a code agree as "of Ivan iwanowitsch, the effect is that the daughter had lost a tooth."
I am currently even to some schlagringe about a friend whom I trust.
It also gives me the schlagringe only because he knows that I not verpfeife him.
newcomers looking for weapons, in various ways.
The former military Viktor baranez tried it in the middle of the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on the subject.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
Was he got a photo album, in which "everything possible" abgebildet.
"I felt like in shops selling luxury goods," recalls the military.
The buyer gets согласно baranez not a pig in a poke, but everything can ausprobieren.
I buy not just as a potential customer, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we are a target.
"I can shoot it there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the approach.
shopping from the sofa
internetsuchmaschinen show search results to web pages and groups in "vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for different purposes."
It will not be any papers needed there are still personal meeting.
"You need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "kampfpistole or gun buy."
Users enter their orders and ask questions. There
is also sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users "Ivan" (wörtliches quote).
"buy a TT. Moscow," is the lakonische question of "fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service, recently shut down countless scheinwebseiten, and buyers who want to buy weapons, go to the service zuhauf into the network.
The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in Siberia and must coal shovels
militärkommentator and former militärangehöriger Viktor baranez
I have heard of the scheme: the site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money on an ATM.
"In response, he received a photo and a description of the weapon," reports the press secretary of the nonprofit organization "pravo na verstecks oryzhie" dmitrij kislow.
Viktor baranez stressed that we finally empty out and behind bars can be, if you placed a question on a web page.
The Federal Security Service, recently shut down countless scheinwebseiten, and buyers who want to buy weapons, go to the service zuhauf into the network.
"The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and must coal shovels," he says.
A makarow for 100 dollars
The purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 dollars to count.
According to Dmitri kislow by the organisation "pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a type makarow pistol for $100 to 300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military waffenlagern aufsehern middle class.
According to the official statistics, the interior ministry, the number of offences with illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 9 thousand back, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to 7.8% dwindled.
In the United States strike fast-food- and supermarkt-beschäftigte
One in four American teenagers sitting at some point behind the checkout of MC Donald's
In the last few days there was massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants across the United States popular fast food chains such as MC Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's, taco bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether you will soon be back to the air out.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple walmart- and fast-food-beschäftigten the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly gewerkschaftlich organisiert.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, in the ausverkäufe took place in the US, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to handgemengen.
On this day, some walmart-mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work down and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branch of the chain, which targets individuals are low and middle income.
Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the walmart-filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why buy many of the slightly paid walmart-beschäftigten only at the workplace.
The prices and the warensortiment machten Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart the goods often sell only so cheap, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of serious conditions, for example lack of trucks or handscanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution for the company health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical walmart-mitarbeiter, 9.5\ xC2$ deserves the hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company's wage increases on 12\ xC2 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are about 1.1% more than they now pay donations.
Walmart wage increases would fully applies to the customers, kostete every purchase they only 46 cents more in the future.
per year would be the extra expenditure of just 12,39 dollars for them compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only to protests in nine States and that the company no losses bescherten.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and the next day in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the walmart-kassen on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing huffington post that a "less than five" walmart-mitarbeiter the work niederlegten only "another PR stunt" and the action of the trade unions, which organised the protests that had happened.
"free cash!"
The protests went further in New York this week, where their goal but not walmart-filialen (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid.
jumaane Williams, a member of the New York municipal
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation in 7,25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
No one was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to make do with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there are the forum a comment to the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the 40th street and Madison avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast-food-restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food-branche.
The US law prohibits it standing in the way of corporate governance, this objective and gewerkschaftsmitglieder abzumahnen or dismiss.
On the other hand, makes the governance you not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food-branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
unhappy
noisy protests there was on this day, many other fast food options in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local democrats languages including stadtratsmitglied jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, bürgermeisterkandidat bill de blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food-mitarbeiter together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, every New York deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food-industrie.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, far from all of them employed in the fast-food-branche are in the tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain is so far only moderately überlisten"
The supporters of modern technologies popular issue of augmented reality is usually seen through the lens of a special glasses in recent times.
First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then know that Microsoft had such a patent pending.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d-technologies in microsoft-labor in Cambridge shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a durchgangsstation.
It's the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and virtual space to create.
- please describe a brief, what research your group operates.
- we are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity is largely stuck in the period in which worked with pixels on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.
However, we want 5-10 years vorausblicken and predict the radical changes this interaction.
For example, the xbox-konsole and the kinect-sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without kinect xbox, as all interested in motion control.
- what awaits us in the future?
- although kinect the interaction has brought on a physical level, is much still on the flat, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive.
We try to change, work in a real three-dimensional darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We have the computer world in our physical world entlassen and make it fassbarer.
To this end, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helme Los!
- what do you think about sprachsteuerung?
It is popular, but it will not overvalued?
- It is certainly not the allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all umstehenden would like to inform about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of governance of objects in public places on a project, for which short and narrow, instead of spreading gesten experimentierten.
The gestures were not recorded by the objektkamera, but by a bracelet, the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future, mixed steuerungstypen, for example, gestures and language.
- As?
For example - we would you ask me to give you this sprudeldose to rich?
They say it and, at the same time it.
- Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- this means that they want the user can afford to adapt what a machine at the time and what is not?
- not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next time we especially need to be working on the development of new sensortypen, which make it possible to capture reactions of people more.
The can, for example be lasersensoren, as they offer in depth a good resolution, which is very important.
- which claims they are on the basis of their work with the xbox kinect-sensoren on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?
- the current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithmen more work.
It is not only the resolution along the X and y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.
, the speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little.
Stephen betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in redmond a berührungssensor with an adjustable verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
influenced not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
- kinect is currently working with three "cameras," and one of them actually a infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary rgb-kamera.
It is not used to calculate the objekttiefe.
More cameras may solve the problem...
or increase the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be a flexible, kinect-ähnliches system, in which we could play with various kameraneigungen to see how we help the three-dimensional ermittlung a position.
- if I remember rightly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google's glasses not to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects?
- of course it is not pleasant to keep unterwegs always collected a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses could switch to the smartphone,
The glasses is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an augmented reality through glasses prevents you can work together with other virtual objects.
- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony stark in iron man, but also normalsterblichen accessible.
There is a problem, to the critics frequently this idea out: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
The answers to your group on this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of sensitive perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual projektionsunterlage.
It takes pressure notável true!
But there are also technologies that actually are aimed at the "pictures in the air" to give a robust, for example, produces the interference by some gerichteten ultraschallstrahlen is in a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but at the moment is still so weak, as pustete someone on the handballen.
There are also tapes for the wrist to nervenendungen effect on the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- have you tried to fool the brain?
It to think that it can feel what it should feel, if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.
Here lies another task on which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people that has to be physically located in a closed room, think that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
so far is only moderately outwit the brain, and we still have many busy years.
It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers so attractive: on many issues we are only at the beginning.
own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
rosbalt continues the "Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the urban dwellers, the form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the fine list landeten already senior representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often without recognition in Europe, in the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of rosbalt is the extravagant knstler kirill Miller.
The whole town knows kirill Miller, dressed in red, the bearded one time at the Russian museum, sometimes in the summer garden, time szene-treffen or encountered at openings.
Wherever the images of kirill Miller also issued, will attract large crowds.
kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, the new myths created.
kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile in the face by his presence on the street his fellow citizens, and to you for good mood.
He recently snapped a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg drehorgelspieler, because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image finally.
- kirill, why are you actually always in red and not for example in yellow and Turquoise in the city on the road?
I chose the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world is red of the compromise between artists, imageberater and society.
In the society calls everything differs somewhat from the graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But let me through my provocations with the people come into the conversation.
any of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- when did you know that you have to be painter?
were issued - at an exhibition in the palace of culture newskij, in my work.
I realised that I must go down this route.
Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognised painter then to end, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the new generation of painters, so with the representatives of the "gazonewschina"; it was "pushkinskaya 10," and then was once end.
It attracts me to theater, to fashion, music, actually to everything except the literature.
- and all the united in your art-klinik... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovierungsarbeiten a musikalisch-künstlerischen club for the boheme, the House of St. Petersburg boheme.
Many were born there: n.o.m. tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "ucho van goga" There came.
cast and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight shirts and also the trendy composer Igor wdowin today was one of them.
When the group started to play live, was from it "Leningrad".
trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of "halli-galli."
We gave them trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "griboedov" have their origin in the art-klinik.
There, our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press, on the award was "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and that I was reached at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without making a cultural contribution to make.
- your work have a unique style.
- many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly currentness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian museum as clowns."
clowns timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it grieveth and bereitet fear, to be so.
In a clown blurs the everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by we dictate that everyone fully to dress up.
Now, everyone on the clothes and is based on the outer and not on the interior of the people.
But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but it should in the face of spit.
The deception disappears through the verkleiden.
- recently we saw you in the role of urban drehorgelspielers. - a city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- can also be commercial art be beautiful?
- today must be commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
Earlier formed the people large groups: the bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other.
Now there are mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not einhundert-dollar-note, everyone likes.
Now you have to consider, whom you'll like.
Now, every kultstar about 100 supporters.
- to the appearances of stas michailow come but several thousand!
- come to him verlassene women, the sexuell-soziale sphere plays a role there.
for cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes on.
I have supporters, and the important thing is not to cheat and that, not to destroy it.
In my youth I have such images painted in a collector even in a number with the works of Falk and larionow hingen.
I started with images, which normally only come at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
- kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- good kulturexperten.
say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real Tsar it was different, because the Tsar understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what the experts, but they could be the road is blocked, as it hochrangigerer experts need to properly evaluate the the former and you clear the way.
Now, only their own taste.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that you honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters, therefore, must look for other museums.
Petersburg - what is for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there is much more culture and an appropriate breeding ground.
On our stones can art difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people, visit the exhibitions and concerts.
We are the much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants the city st.-petersburg
birth in space
Earth danger.
Global warming or zusammenstoß with killerasteroid.
caravans of raumschiffen erdbewohnern aboard are on the search for a ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we in the weightlessness or on the ersatzplaneten fortpflanzen can?
Many choices in my opinion, there is not.
De facto, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomische sternberg-instituts Vladimir surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars vergleichsweise lebensfreundlich are, there is on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in all, possible.
The issue of reproduction in the all treated the researchers first of all in relation to the flora.
already half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation in orbit gezüchteten erbsen difference is not in the least of the species on Earth.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem. begins
"The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laborleiter of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische problems ran, Vladimir sychew.
Without firm untergrund überschlugen the chicks wild.
ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the neugeborenen fixării unui.
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud.
Four days later they died then simply.
"twice we were chicks hatch and found the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," hält Vladimir sychew for a failed experiment with the chicken in the all clear.
The last brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, will be based on the biosatelliten "bion" only same-sex species are.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized were sent into space.
prinzipiell noted it was nothing special.
"It was just with the biosatelliten, but again, it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir sychew.
After landing bekamen the weltraumratten nachwuchs.
The issue of reproduction directly in space you could not solve so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their fortpflanzungstrieb.
In contrast to animals could man it in principle.
abstraktem think the Homo sapiens is capable and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk there was in Tereshkova.
The most precious that mankind has, is the female body.
Our möwe flew them, and no one on earth would you can answer the following question: übersteht the space?
It is after this flight can bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says raumfahrtveteran wachtang watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space, gave birth to the first female kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, andrijan nikolajew, was also kosmonaut.
In 1988 gave birth to the second woman in all, swetlana sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son.
, remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut to long flights, where all went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut waleri poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet the humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in vorbereitungszentrum cosmonaut is a mandatory station during the flugvorbereitung.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small ichtyander zeugnis of drop that life on the land the ocean entstieg.
There is a connection between the fact that approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid as a child is, and that it can more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swim just 2 weeks go by.
"This is too little time to forget something," says babyschwimmlehrerin Marina aksenowa.
While for a newborn child so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness is the bauch- and beckenmuskulatur extremely fast back and so has the ability, the child herauszupressen.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende hilfsmittel.
The birth could also take place in a spezialkammer, for example, to the child herauszupressen.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity.
Without the erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles cannot train.
A newborn child in orbit cannot be set as an adult for training in a belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of, which is vital for his life.
"This experiment that we make, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world," says the head of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor pestow, advance.
So far, the birth of children in space theory.
At some point, but they become reality if the erdbewohner in their space ships to a distant planet up, all of the home for their geborenen nachkommen.
nkú-chef: control of the schwarz-systems failed by verschulden Politics
The Czech Republic in connection with public contracts has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, is back in their application.
In the interview for aktuálně.cz says this is the Vice-President of the highest kontrollamtes (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, nkú), Miloslav kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us," said kala the current situation.
To a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As negative praxisbeispiel he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "schwarz-system."
The Prime Minister, said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would harass - so the system is now banned or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and impede the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities," kala notes.
At the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies they talked about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, under which both countries' laws on public contracts were compared.
So what was it in concrete terms?
There is a parallel examination, with which we have started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the fact that the European legislative sets, as are, to build the national legislation on public contracts to handle. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences say. Generally speaking, are perhaps even something "strict laws in the US and perfect," but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?
just such a common control could help that we stop, we constantly seeking perfection of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and to exclude illegal enrichment or criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we are achieving this goal.
It may even be that we the system in this way only with excessive paperwork burden"," and those who seek loopholes in the system, have it significantly easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values remained higher.
You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech vergabegesetzes.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our nkú, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, is the German equivalent of the nkú bundesrechnungshof, is similarly structured as both work with us and also has a College, this is just something else is formed, authorities is similar.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is a state, however, is that there is this Courts of Auditors in the individual States - is the German system differs from our.
The brh may only federal funding control what our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities for us, subject to the control of landesrechnungshöfe there.
As regards the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
In general I would compare it without specific details reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, and you certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
Perhaps that is where the auditors are better?
This is certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like.
This is still worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise you would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?
As regards the Czech legislation, which was important for your authority the revision of the vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in force, it is in our tests have not yet.
As our controls nachträglich, we must take place here with some delay.
implications we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have introduced the new instrument "recognition of risks inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - this will impact the changes of course, as the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified.
You see the adoption of this law more positive, or the system will be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption confirmed.
It can occur, however, the problem that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous Rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carriers (for example, in the case of operational programmes of regional policy, the regional council) dahingehend that any failure to comply with the vergabegesetzes amounts to a breach of discipline.
It makes sense, but then to make the law even tougher?
I do not believe in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, on the real decision-making not impact.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all, which way is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that allowing the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "schwarz-systems" behelligen würde - what does that mean exactly?
The schwarz-system is now banned or allowed?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and hinder the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities.
He said: "We can change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.
The vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is right for the protection of the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone because of formfehlern is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing with us.
on the streets there is sometimes eisglätte, but they are mostly dry.
on the streets of the Czech Republic is partly schnee- and eisglätte.
Mostly however, the streets are easily passable, sometimes is increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary the streets this morning easily passable, sometimes there was snow and eisglätte.
The temperature fell to -5 to -10 ° C, it should be warmer during the day.
In the region of snow there is now no longer, and at the lower altitudes is only a thin snow.
On the mountain ridges of the ore mountains, however, are about 30 centimetres of snow.
According to the bezirksstraßenwacht was because of fog limited visibility.
The superstrada r6 and the infrastructure of the first straßenklasse in the region are currently fully passable.
However, attention is offered, for example, on bridges, on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
Plans are also all routes of the second and third straßenklasse, including the mountain roads.
On these roads remain, however, abschnittsweise vereiste or ausgefahrene schneereste.
Particularly in the higher altitudes is therefore increased attention needed.
districts pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets ostböhmens is danger because eisglätte in higher altitudes and in the mountains on the streets sometimes even a ausgefahrene schneeschicht, shares the road and autobahndirektion on their websites.
The straßenmeistereien warn drivers before eisglätte may occur, particularly in the higher positions in the district of pardubice.
To eisglätte it can in particular verkehrswegen the second and third straßenklasse lanškroun ústí nad orlicí, polička svitavy and vysoké mýto come in the quarters.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow, particularly on the streets in krkonoše and in the mountains orlické Hory.
A ausgefahrene schneeschicht is in höhenlagen on the streets of the circles rychnov nad kněžnou and trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia it is today mostly sunny and serene, and it remains largely niederschlagsfrei.
The temperatures move between -3 and + 1 ° C, there is a weak wind.
district plzeň
The roads in the district plzeň are easily passable, locally, however, increased attention is needed, and the driving is adapting to the weather.
This is the morning chill, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing.
As it has snowed before and then the temperatures fell, it can come on the streets to eisglätte.
Local is also expected to fog, with the view, however, will improve in the course of the day.
These data come from the bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The motorway D5 is virtually fully passable, increased attention, however, recommend the straßenmeistereien between the 80th and the 131 kilometres.
The roads of the first straßenklasse are mainly dry, but durchgefroren.
In the south of the circles plzeň and tachov, it may reach eisglätte abschnittsweise.
The roads are the second and third straßenklasse feucht, and therefore also applies here the reference to possible icy sections.
driver mainly on the less frequentierten böhmerwald roads in the area should be especially careful.
Of olomouc
expect schneematsch must now drivers, in the direction the olomouc höhenlagen in the district are on the road.
After the use of streufahrzeugen schneematsch remains on the pass červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards videlský kříž.
nächtliches schneetreiben forced the straßenmeistereien for use in circles\ xC5 umperk fielen according to the straßenverwaltung about 3 inches of fresh snow.
In the other areas of the district, the roads meist fully passable.
"in the circle\ xC5 umperk verbleiben schneereste at high altitudes.
On the pass červenohorské sedlo drivers have towards jeseník with schneematsch count," said an employee of the straßenverwaltung\ xC5 čtk umperk today against the Agency.
and her colleagues in the bochnia jeseník had to in the night out, according to its data, the streets to the höhenlagen after chemical treatment free and wet.
In the District of olomouc fully which roads are passable, in circles\ xC5 ternberk drivers have to careful in waldabschnitten drive, however, because the roads here are still wet.
bezirk ústí, bezirk Liberec
In northern Bohemia melden the straßenmeistereien several bad befahrbare straßenabschnitte.
In addition to several places with snow or eisglätte is the bergstraße telnice after knínice in the bochnia ústí n.k. according to the traffic police blocked.
temperatures will also remain in lower below zero, so that will keep snow and ice on the roads. From the lowland, particularly in the southeast of Bohemian mittelgebirge are opposed to it reported no problems, and the roads are usually dry there.
so far are not verkehrsstörungen reported.
eisglätte in particular from the periphery of\ xC5 tětí reported.
According to Meteorologists were there on the night ideal conditions - rain and melting snow during the day, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
Of the main routes and on the road I/13 on the border of the districts ústí n.l. and Liberec bad traffic conditions reported.
The closure of the road between telnice and knínice was needed because of branches, the snow were pushed up on the road.
\ xC5 imon ornest: at our concerts we want positive energy sammeln
What do you think about that in less than a month of doomsday is due to take place?
This is one of those katastrophenmeldungen, to which we humans so like anspringen.
We do with our band the tap tap more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the doomsday to stop or prevent.
In December you realize also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
You can our readers the project closer to vorstellen?
It is a landesweite benefizveranstaltung, which we have two years.
For this, we want to use the maya-kalenders marketingpotenzial whose end for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m. prognostiziert is.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, will take place from 21:00 gleichzeitig three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts to be roughly at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a zeitzone for 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends.
By whom is this idea?
Originally think of me, then we have the idea together with our graphic honza Augusta fleshed out.
We would not gain enough positive energy to the doomsday to prevent, but we also want to cooperate with the public, what state we consider this world once handed over to our children.
At the end of the maya-kalenders we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and schlüsselanhängern against the doomsday, with their purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band the tap tap, together with other performers also included the so-called anthem against the weltuntergang entitled "doomsday is from."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also on the benefizkonzerten erklingen?
Of course, and in the end, provided that all is fine and the weltuntergang takes place...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
Also, the hymns together in a direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the video clip, also xindl X singt with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, that implies that we achieve many fundraisers and concerts.
We strive to these people closely involved in our projects.
It was clear that most are interested in cooperation with us, and enjoy it.
What purpose benefits the proceeds of the concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier bildungszentrums studeo, where we already six years together with the Association tap in jedlička-institut work.
The students of the jedlička-instituts are regularly maintained by editors that help them in different activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to the editors go, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the jedlička-instituts should create its own building in which we then move in with this project.
Each concert treten several groups and performers.
according to what criteria they have chosen?
We wanted a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague treten chinaski, for example, support lesbiens illustratosphere with Dan bárta, the tap tap, marián bango and Jiří suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their auslandspläne are not just small, so far, they are already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group, made up of people with disabilities.
How you manage these travel locistics and organisational?
It is not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage. We must also, of course, many instrumentenkoffer and other luggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čsa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I am sometimes have partly been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By their foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, as it deals with disabled people.
As you have seen these things?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that the East is everything still in its infancy.
In Prague, Moscow is not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.
It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately, entstehen clubs there, are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way we must catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we later on...
It is, however, still be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities selbstständig in public space, go to the museum, toilets can use.
But it is not just üblich, that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, where we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if major athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers from our ranks, are things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.
The tap tap is very popular at the moment. But if we go back a couple of years: what has it in 1998 motivated to start a band?
At the time I started as a supervisor in jedlička-institut, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.
And since I myself am musicians and ua. saxofon games, I, together with a colleague a musik-ag founded.
Well, and with time is that as our leader, láďa angelovič is wont to say, something out of control (laughs).
became known the band but only in the last few years, or Am I mistaken?
It is true that has helped us cooperation with famous singers; we have also started to campaign actively for us to.
We are aware that, if something is doing and this is not to see on the outside, their own performance in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the eu-fördergelder we can also do good editors, high quality equipment and u.ä..
It was their goal, it with the tap tap so far to bring?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that can things in a different way.
copied in show business today often one of the other.
This is logical, in its own way as everything new viewed with caution and only after a long time will be accepted.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the viewers usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret müssten.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if you have the funds to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities in something, this is a progress not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success also helpful, that you are a strict boss, as we hear from many people?
If you would like to do something well, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
But this is, in my view, completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you find that you need to have test twice a week, vorbereitungsphasen absolvieren and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then erlischt enthusiasm in many quickly.
It works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, the tap tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 in this?
A single: láďa angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. You cannot prevent.
Who has the will and the desire on the part, is welcome at any time.
will take place the day before the predicted Doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: incheba-arena/Prague, fléda/Brno and plynojem/Ostrava; 12 tschechische bands and other musicians
All three venues will conclude by live-schaltung connected and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday is from" the band The tap tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the facilities of a multifunctional accessibility bildungszentrums that under the name studeo in jedlička-institut should arise in Prague. cost: 25 million kč
admission costs 400 kč, children up to 12 years free, tickets are available in advance at bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was on a ministerratssitzung of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as zwanzigstes Member of this space. Poland is included with the second Member State from the former eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 esa-mitglied).
Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several esa-projekten.
The way of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish kosmosbegeisterte employees with the space, but they do not always on understanding stießen.
I refer, for example, of the lecture by A.\ xC5 ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work presented "entrance to the outer space exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born. However, 1905) made the audience cold, and after years remembered\ xC5 ternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan gadomski had shown interest in his work.
\ xC5 ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the outer space exploration" by Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix rep-hirsch.
Dr. Jan gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of the space was ua. dadurch acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a eisenbahn-draisine was built in Poland, for which a raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or to brake the draisine should be used.
The information come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry, to deal with raketenbetriebenen floors.
The research led the Institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw wolfke and Prof. gustaw mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents which that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war.
But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
in 1937, in the press of dipl.eng. rohoziński stammende draft fotoelektrischen jagdrakete on, and the following year was the work of "rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza leliwa-krzywoblocky" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of raketentechnik from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy) coordinated.
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, the war began.
More articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the Journal problemy, in which four long articles are devoted to the space.
The article by Prof. M. subotowicz contains the proposal to create a raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there was already the first projects for comparison, and it was clear that the Exploration of Space future would have.
Already in its beginnings in 1956 was the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was founded in 1951 in the autumn of 1956 ordinary Member.
The following year, the first pta-vorsitzende, Kazimierz zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
held he had this position until his death in 1959.
since 1956, the PTA maßgeblich took part in the development of highly successful meteorological rakete (rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Polish rakete for scientific research.
The first type, the rm-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the rm-1a, built, and began in 1959 in the błędów-wüste flugtests with the zweistufenrakete rm-2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development should already be able to make real scientific work - the rakete rm-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of höhenwinden used.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
rm, the successor to the first missiles of the type from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte meteor-1-rakete.
The rocket was designed as zweistufenrakete, their total fraud 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rakete three types have been developed (meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of transportraums for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1a-rakete had a transportraum with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0,34 liters and meteor-1c 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types 37 km.
In the 1965 to 1968 was developed in luftfahrtinstitut meteor-2-rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 miles.
Then, the versions meteor-2h and meteor-3 built.
Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, on the creation of a national cospar-ausschusses followed two years later.
Poland was also involved in the framework of the interkosmos-programms with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek zweiter interkosmonaut.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court the law on voluntary work.
This decision gave rise to a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue time from a wider perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation.
due to the large differences in the value of work (löhne) It comes to preisspannungen.
Under this term is through a state trying to understand where the manufacturers, imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition, making the competition for usurping "unterbietet," with a greater market share and increase its profit.
This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business there. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
As the capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily the spending increase.
This situation is made even worse by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to replace the total economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practices of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce artificially the social level of their own people and thus to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital in particular lohnbereich.
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by reducing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are several years ago public lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers such a small salary that the state must increase their income to subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees workers exposed.
The austerity measures of practically all eu-südstaaten undoubtedly will amount to the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance darben on the margins of society and do hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here is, of course, the question of where this capital is?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This all of Latin America.
liberal theories and media claim that the state must not with capital involved in its own economy ad nauseam, and that planned economy lead to economic disaster.
Private capital engstirnig insists on his position that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy.
But then we must ask if the capital the policy and to the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even beyond.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically ubiquitous almighty and in all States lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual bevorteilung, of legislation, is criminally punishable, but nothing in the virtually everything.
The situation in Germany is such that a staatsministerium due to a lack of finances private, closely with the industry verflochtene rechtsunternehmen tasked with formulating gesetzentwürfen.
These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
The violence is no longer, as the Western verfassungen announce, but of strong financial groups, from the people who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly fall into a situation, as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic at times cäsars and pompeius' describes: "the state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices were filled by violence.
against schmiergeld, through illegal erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.
corruption has grown hemmungslos vote already purchased, and the people went to the election... "" People with character bewarben not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul... "" I really started talking about it, that the only medicine is a one-man rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man elected... "appian thought it to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.
As it turns out, is today's society as well as in ancient times based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
The private sector is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.
Now, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the slightest seek deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look to the ruthless liberalisation of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state, the sinking this regime for liberal democracies can be regarded as some pause, already looming in the next round.
particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, and witnessed the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to press down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution is targeted politisch-soziale reforms, to increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratory of the chaos.
"nothing... that emerges from violence, or ever could arise" singt sting in the song fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons do not want war, there would be no," says the dying gutele schnaper, wife of Mayer amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.
The a stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide and committed to the Palestinian Arabs call the State of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about it, who in these recurring waves of killing schuldiger and who is victims; in the end, Israel's current residents including selbstverwaltungsgebiete were born in the current political situation and have not seen the beginning of the violence itself.
My concern is to open up the readers look behind the scenes, the look, whom the 95 years spannung (gerechnet wersji balfour-deklaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East are mainly serve.
My thoughts are based partly on zugängliche historical facts, others are derived from this and go out from my own understanding of who or what group of people strongly affected the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can represent a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really were getting these people themselves that their steps autonom certain, or whether behind the throne was someone who drew their actions to a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time, concentrated in the wealth of the world is in the hand less individual, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not created within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomisch stands out is a particularly rich families who could be described as the head of the kraken (I do not know whether anyone else is on them, I do not exclude this but) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about you.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) has been bought in the 1990s of the 19th century by the Rothschilds, to connect your name with hochkriminellen action to prevent, in whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and to the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, run wars or are these (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the fall of ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia in the meantime, its central bank has the Russian government unterstellt).
Whoever has tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as the central bank, began during the civil war, launch their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre.
j.f. Kennedy began to launch their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; the member Louis MC fadden was poisoned after 1936 the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929, he wanted to sue.
The global machtgelüste Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert pik, a freimaurer of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed, the big monarchistischen staatenwesen Europe to eliminate, by the second war should be especially broken Britain's colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would not consume as many resources for their amenities and luxury concerns and would also create a universalreligion), (the ökumenismus here is nothing more than the run-up to) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top is unleashing a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from chao - order out of the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see foundation of the Fed, so that crises such as those of you in 1907 triggered not repeat).
After it had succeeded in them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian zarenreiches, the war was no longer necessary), then, the resolution of the mitteleuropäischen großmacht österreich-ungarns.
In the Second World War easier to spark ließen bankers by the policy a latent conflict, creating Germany with gigantic kriegsreparationen belegten; thus, they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to the German only a sufficiently strong leaders unterjubeln, which named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take and also took to spark the kriegsbrand.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, where a branch of establishing a judenstaates sought, as in the historic area judäas with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned balfour-deklaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the local Arab population.
There was terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain losriss, on the the international bankers anfänglich had kept him, or if everything went according to plan, is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps laid the foundations for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the kriegsreparationen against Germany prepare the ground for the second world war, the declaration of the state of Israel was the creation of the brennpunktes for the third world war.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash the Jewish people will like this war in the second world war victims in the front kampflinie, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (one need only think, as sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where only wrong in an endless spiral of violence is wrong, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
We must distinguish between the citizens of Israel and of its leadership here, but the international bankers are in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates to choose from.
The current Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, the international bankers loyal ergebenen politikers, doing everything to spark a war with Iran, which has given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan could extend...), soon became a global conflict, and where it due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide street run by hormus, about 20% of global oil supplies, could come to the deterioration of the global economy.
In which light because the words David Rockefellers from 1994: "the only thing we need is a crisis that spans everything, and people will welcome the new world order."
In your idea is the new world order a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of finanzaristokraten.
A world in which every newborn at birth is a chip implanted, to submit to the essence of total control.
"and it is that the small and the large, the rich and the poor, all free and the servants, give a malzeichen on your right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malzeichen, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who has understood, considering the number of the beast.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig."
The film ARGO: when it's at its worst, Hollywood anrufen
In November 1979 besetzte a mob demonstrierender Islamist students the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
for their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades was the patronage of his regime had maintained.
For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford the Shah jettison, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time she was not in a position to in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt the geiselbefreiung made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian Government had been.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods hervor.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film ARGO of the film director and actor Ben affleck describes an episode of this story, the US a small teilsieg bescherte.
Just before the occupation of the message, six botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them an extravagant story to covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a drehorte filmstabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction-film besuchte.
Of the genres
The plan developed by experts for "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also made the cooperation Hollywood needed.
So the camouflage was credible, erschienen article about this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
afflecks film is a special combination of several filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called "caper movie," i.e., the story of a successful husarenstücks such as the film ocean's eleven.
This change in the movie The stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the dokumentarszenen from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs shown in the title sequence, and there are no major differences in the filmfassung the same situations).
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly überspitzt therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the cia-zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on besprechungstisch amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben affleck is a remarkable reboot his career with this film succeeded.
From a belächelten actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO his third feature film after the crime is not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is afflecks first film, not in the local Boston plays the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place it was one of the features that the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood abhoben.
affleck proves this sense but also in ARGO, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - indeed the eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and it gives the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere even history.
affleck and his team achieved a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
act in too many places too much
The director also had to deal with that, that history is not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
He works with the little but it quite successfully, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft - and then not always seems so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is averted, or even the chase on the runway, looked a bit curious).
The weakness of ARGO is his too widely-dispersed range, which is limited by the need to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan arkin and John Goodman is very charming, but their characters have more space in their roles as hollywood-mitarbeiter deserves, and that they are in the film is far from alone.
afflecks film loses it a little traction. It is a film that we watch with some interest and in the design and a thriller from the 70 years erinnernden retro-stil goutieren can.
enthusiasm, it is difficult.
Until now as a reminder of a living piece of history in some way and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the bloat of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, every year a survey on the absurdesten bankgebühren exclaims, has decided to hold the contest "most absurd regulation or idea from the eu-werkstatt" this year.
"On this idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of major European companies," said Patrik nacher to care about the organisation of this survey, the newspaper právo.
Among the nominees absurditäten is located, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then genossen women in life insurance an advantage, because they are objectively less risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible attacks from the eu-werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The real vote will occur by the end of February 2013," said then.
controversial regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which in its result naturschädigend, furthermore, the prohibition of reliable quecksilberthermometer just because this is a relatively small amount of this gefahrenstoffes enthalten, or even the directive to the size of hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butteraufstrich" or the marketing of conventional light bulbs.
bananas must be 14 inches long
The eu-apparat entscheidet often under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (for example, currently trying the Czech Republic, also with veto-drohung demands Czech banks impose).
lobby-interessen were also discovered that the highest handelsklasse bananas in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and should not have "krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that it only the fragmented national standards harmonisiere that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the note that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years the balloon not without the supervision of an adult can inflate.
The EU stood in an American study, according to balloons are the leading cause of the death by asphyxiation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of jahrmarktströten.
Curious einfälle there is also home
relatively absurd is also a directive, which European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU, because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead say Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The server bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez faire in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the scale of lebensmittelvorräten on the territory of a Member State.
The EU laid the höchstvolumen lebensmittelvorräten found that, on the day of our membership of the EU in the area of the Czech Republic are durfte.
The Czech Republic überschritt then threatened for the volume for pilzkonserven, for which we have established a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, but that they have no sea, or by the idea, to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, however, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We in the EU will refund request," said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav palas (čssd).
As an argument, he led to the getreideernte was very high and the state as a result of the so-called interventionseinkäufe überfüllt camp were.
Because the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, the EU should согласно palas hundreds of millions of euros to us figures.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far in that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding offered the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of the Communities Minister Pavel němec (us-deu), specifically, it has to be the funding for the establishment of fördergeldanträgen act to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
regulations in the Member States are easy to target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to the experts are more the eu-fördergelder for projects, which together with the deepening of European integration have nothing, but when the budget negotiations were imposed by individual Member States.
Emotions calls in the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "olomoucké tvarůžky" to defend the inländerrum (tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "tuzemák."
The name 1300-talshus may only be used for products from zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the company of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola, the lübecker marzipans or the parmaschinkens now the Karlsbader biscuits, carp from pohořelice and třeboň, or even the saazer hops.
With a eu-marke can as the pardubicer gingerbread or the hořicer serpentini breasts.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said okamura.
Mr senator, how you get to the idea to stand for the office of President?
It is not about me, Senator or President to be.
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would run nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic plundered for 20 years will, as thieves around freely, while the people's taxes and the retirement age be increased.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no option but to influence things, to run for the office of a senator or the President.
In the Senate, they have succeeded and then immediately made on the road to the castle.
return it not their voters the back?
I have said all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of senatswahlen.
Later I have this clarified and said that I will run for the office of President, if I am elected senator.
But my goal is not function. The function is an instrument, with whom I can do my vision.
That I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television complaining, but every niedermachen who wants to make a difference.
In addition, the media, the honour rauben wish, and confuse the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
about me was, for example, claims that I would journalists are or that I was Jiří Paroubek consultants.
We are talking about their visions.
The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retroactive vermögenserklärungen included over 20 million Crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As ordinary citizens, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and this keeps the population only.
As an independent parteiloser I have a much greater potential to win support for all political parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I am without schubladendenken and parteidogmen of each party can take what is best for our country.
See you as a man in politics more to the right or left?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people give me more left.
For me, this rechts-links-denken but totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right camp belongs; I would like to human beings.
I always support publicly every good approach, even if it comes from the ksčm or of the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone described as populists.
But confirm the not by what you have just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you have a idealziel and a vision.
And this would you approach.
This can be as far as I am concerned call populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only keywords.
And that brings you in politics in the long term not far away.
Or do you think that you, if you only long enough to talk to the people, will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them on our side, to achieve these goals.
It would be no problem for me, as President, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to urge the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors on to the statute book.
And the raised müssten may then say why you object to this.
A strong personality, which highlights abuses, can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a credit of the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I have only just started and attempts to find my program, for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little, as if okamura tschechien should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that I alone nothing faciliti; that is why I have discussed this with several celebrities, if you do not want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example with radim jančura spoken, but because arbeitsüberlastung refused.
I also have the investigative journalist Jana lorencová supports, the fraud in the trade with light fuel oil aufdeckte.
My candidacy, I began with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of voters are not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct election of Mayors and bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about setting up a separate party after?
I have not thought about this, because I don't have time to review the past each potentiellen parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.
I do not even have money for the präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 kč.
You have no money?
You talk about vermögenserklärungen, how would your?
My wealth I appreciate to about 60 million kč.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a\ xC5 kodu superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was also a kindertraum - James Bond has always appealed to me, as he was in the car drove to women galant and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but their own money you do not want to invest in it.
This is not particularly convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have 2.5 million put into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources to deny.
The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senatorengehalt I could not live alone, so I could for my son not the English school finance costs, the 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You're still continue to work as entrepreneurs, to have their livelihoods?
Not, you said that these activities will be back?
But this is not linked to the level of the salary.
As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.
For example, my deputy managing director of the travel agencies in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, the Republic of rettet.
But I must but also of something life.
Which monthly income, they were used as an entrepreneur?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still so.
As President, I would my activities quite einstellen.
You can find the full conversation in the samstagsausgabe právo.
The mvrdv architects show that the real adventure are not only in the head - the example of spijkenisse and the recently errichteten bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find this funny, it looks futuristic buildings, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette verhaig, a passantin roadside.
And Stefan spermon, it-techniker in a nearby großbetrieb, says: "But, well, it is already the House."
But I wonder, what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-bibliotheken, right?
spijkenisse, a barely besichtigungsbedürftige schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, is strange rekordhalter.
The 80.000-einwohner-gemeinde has the lowest bildungsrate across the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the education and the seven fictional bridges, which are displayed on the euroscheinen than pretty bepinselte stahlbetonminiaturen nachzubauen.
The success of the bildungsoffensive stayed in check.
And so, recognized the stadtväter that there is only one way, the statistics to be Mr: a library to her.
winy Maas from Rotterdam architekturbüro mvrdv, master of tollkühnen balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, sometimes cynical buildet, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared to wettbewerbs-hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on her face.
And while the jury still verdutzt looked and with the achseln zuckte stapelte the cheeky Maas his exquisite mitbringsel the size to a pyramid and finished his aktionistisch untermauerte speech with the words: "love stadtgemeinde!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the bücherberg spijkenisse, for the so-called boekenberg!
Nine years later, of the 30 million Berg aufgeschüttet.
It is part of a revitalisierungsprojekts, belong to the garage, supermarket, post office and a few neighbouring residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November, the bücherberg awarded the second prize "best library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 nominated.
This is not the faceless kleinstadtretorte, which until now had more to offer than a postmodern pedestriansed and a stunned hässliches radnice, behind the White walls would be inclined to suspect a molkereifabrik to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, spijkenisse now has the first public kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: büchereldorado under käseglocke.
There is a lift, the right through the hills, but the real space and lesefreuden erschließen euphonix fußläufigen climb the topography.
The rundum verglaste interior is bright and clear, the gebrannte klinkerboden and elegant straßenlaternen speak in the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and boys and girls playing football.
Everywhere and books, books, books.
"normally, the bücherregale along the facade, and in the middle is a big, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have the classic raumkonfiguration on its head and the reading area from inside to outside. They
The Interior of the bücherbergs is sent used: in the middle are offices, internet-bibliothek schachclub, umweltzentrum and haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure is the black bücherregale, the time wandverkleidung, sometimes brüstung, sometimes stiegengeländer.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and bauingenieure whether of the unknown baustoffs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said joop trouborst, project manager at the borough spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agrarbetrieb one day met with a suitable waste from agriculture.
For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes kunststoffvlies as wurzelunterlage.
That is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The thin текстильного holds a, two saisonen, then it is ready for the sperrmüll.
pressed for the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantitiesñposes four centimeters thick plates.
Under hitzeeinwirkung and pressure in the so-called landbouwplastic (klp) to a dark, homogeneous belastungsfähigen material that was a after new cars and was a reeks sportschuh.
After 105 stufen is we reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long tour will be in literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch kroketten and eingetopften ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide for atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literaturgebirge.
donations for the new Soul
"You would not believe it, but this House is in spite of the many glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology," says trouborst.
heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the bücherberg under a glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly into the interior.
The broad holzleimbinder standing across the glass, serve as a shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
fully automatic blinds. Do the Rest
Stefan spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library.
Also Lisette verhaig was already there.
And also the tcm-lehrerin cynthia bogarde, the boekenberg even as spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, each residents invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - be filled.
The concept is caught on.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now each residents a certain relationship with this new House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
This is mvrdv those königsdisziplin gelungen, the man called in the jargon identitätsstiftung.
spijkenisse literaturgeschichte written.
So young and uneducated, they may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
szabo: "German must play greater role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned Berlin for a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then enthielt Berlin.
Why?
Stephen szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.
must now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But, at the same time, I believe that it not supported the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy switches and away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
reflected the Germans are so between the fronts.
expected of them, that you have a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think you buttons are still approach to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
have a foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Had these interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.
This plays a role in any case.
But I would also not want to attach too much importance to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in any case in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by it has abstained on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that, in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
But because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, that position public.
I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so hellauf begeistert of Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult for Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other to agree?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead pushing things out of their own position.
do precisely with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major global player - Germany wants to assume a major role at all?
Or is Germany the lead still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time Germany will assume a greater role, verschiedenste anti-deutsche feelings freely.
This makes it the German not easy.
This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from, the EU not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"protection" in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese will
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph lauren ebenfalls.
What is Armani Polo?
behind it lies a in China officially registered name, but it has nothing to do with the ursprungsunternehmen.
But it enjoys protection, as long as the actual namensgeber not complaints.
And even then it is not clear whether you get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor wessing, which specializes in schutzrechtsverletzungen in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The nachahmern rich already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
It will be held from simply lu-gucci Gucci, Prada is prada-kny eintragen.
Also German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturers PUMA.
pattloch opens a folder with eintragungen of markenamts in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, where a Chinese company the trademark zegna df PUMA to protect a kunstnamen, which is also the fashion company ermenegildo zegna bediente.
That the Chinese world champion in the copy and the injured are intellectual property, is known.
In the big cities there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients before he goes against that Chinese companies from markenamt officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "bâng mingpai," a beifahrermarke.
The word is based on "bâng dakuan."
that women are meant, the rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"This is geschäftsschädigend, we must combat it," fordert pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the alleinstellung disappears, the imageschaden is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the industries are in the millions, especially in expensive vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the marktforschungsgesellschaft clsa is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But löschungen dubioser entries in markenregister are hard to reach and go to the money.
up to nine years can last for the procedure, with an uncertain outcome.
pattloch reports of cases in which the Court complaints abwies because, after the long duration of beanstandete name to "marktrealität" had become.
If the plaintiff must have bad luck, he even the plagiator pay money, because his brand in China injured, says pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
famous cases concern graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the baumaschinenhersteller sany, the company that recently the German betonpumpenbauer putzmeister übernahm.
resembles the Chinese must therefore until today use of an emblem that the mercedes-stern.
The volvo-käufer geely used originally a blau-weißes logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.
The modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile schauen ließen in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
While this markenamt ctmo in Beijing is that there 2010 due to lower personnel and raumausstattung bottlenecks have given.
But last year was one of the "emergency in workflow returned to normal life."
It is the bestand unbearbeiteter einspruchsverfahren dropped by 22 percent.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections on erledigung.
tackle costs a lot against
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record for the tenth consecutive year, the list of capabilities around the world lead, and means that China shares with the authority.
That also holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken.
Simplified, it means that any application on average 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros.
To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German company freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
While the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture imitierter kraftfahrzeugteile ausgehoben was.
But secured the nachahmer continues to the Chinese rights to the brand freudenberg.
We have failed to do this, because in Germany familiennamen could not be protected, says hanno wentzler freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich, chairman of the board of directors.
The markenamt ctmo dismissed the appeal of the Munich because back.
In the next two bodies got freudenberg right, but the prozessgegner still fighting today.
We must höllisch careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is extremely complex and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could be hardly put the firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files must review, to provide evidence.
Five years ago, freudenberg the other side in vain a "high sechsstelligen eurobetrag" to resolve.
"This shows you how much we value is," says wentzler.
zurückzuschwappen the dangers in the Far East threaten even to Europe.
That is, if there imitatoren vulnerable brands ensure.
So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name freudenberg for shoes and leather anmelden.
This business has long abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
höllisch must be careful," says wentzler."
Both he and the lawyer pattloch raten German companies to be very careful in doing business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but if the foreigners "everything is somehow schützenswert anmelden, even in China," as wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his markendramas unterliege, it would probably be the other side pay royalties for its own name, said wentzler.
Or we will in the segment squeezed out of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: stampfen, singing, help
The choir in Heidelberg probt imbongi - and in Swaziland freuen aidswaisen about it.
The story of a connection, the far more than 8733 kilometer überwindet.
First there is the stampfen: cowboystiefel basketballschuhe damenpumps and herrenslipper search on the parquet floor the takt, find him quickly.
eins-zwei-drei-vier.
Only then, the voices of singers slowly - old, bass, tenor and soprano - bedrängen, find and track.
And fiete hopf, the 29-jährigen conductors, makes it almost from its stoffschuhen, if it brings together with its smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday night, the choir in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg probt imbongi a new song.
about fifty singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the humangenetikerin to hausmann.
"om 'obani" is not an easy piece, every chorstimme has a different text and also in a very foreign language: zulu, the 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland is spoken.
To help themselves
There are about 34 million people worldwide, the UNAIDS estimates, the program of the United Nations to bekämfung AIDS.
23.5 million people of them live in South Africa.
live in Swaziland 245000 aidswaisen.
More than 40 percent of the population have now HIV positive.
For 180 aidswaisen in the village esitjeni has the Association voices for Africa sponsors found in Germany.
70 of them visit a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can have a patenschaft übernehmen.
It guarantees the child school, school uniform and a hot meal every day in gogo-center.
imbongi means in zulu storyteller or lobpreiser.
The bantusprache fließend can speak in this space, no one but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir songs in this foreign soft language and brings you back then, where they originally come from: from time to time in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers luftlinie of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village esitjeni that depends on the stimmgewalt of German Choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple lehm- and strohhütten, a majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents, because they are the HIV succumbed.
In esitjeni shows up in the small, woran quite Swaziland krankt: highest hiv-infektionsrate lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male foreskin, the ansteckungsrisiko nachweislich cut by half, of the population hardly be adopted.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland are the immunschwäche-virus, with center 30 to die is not unusual.
In a common afrika-reise discovered the choir in spring 2005 the village, but above all, saw the imbongis many children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
leaving school without qualifications has been in a poor country certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir the association "voices for Africa," which is almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in esitjeni since then.
facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
To the bacterial STI zählen syphilis, chlamidia and tripper (gonorrhö).
Frequent virale STI are HIV, humane pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
crab and itch are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the hauptbetroffenengruppen?
syphilis and tripper are mainly in men who have sex with men.
The robert-koch-institut assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany reported syphilis-fälle transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are chlamydien-infektionen trichomonads candidose (mushroom), tripper and humane pappilomaviren often occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in relatively small - yet: about 20 percent of the hiv-neuinfektionen accounts for this group.
Among young people treten chlamydien-infektionen much more frequent than in other communities.
After European surveys refer to three quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here are also humane pappilomaviren among young people often before.
As has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis-infektionen, according to the robert-koch-institut of 1697 erkrankungen in 2001 to 3698 erkrankungen in 2011 more than doubled.
The number of hiv-neuinfektionen goes back since 2007.
2011 there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than a year before.
The symptoms indicate a geschlechtskrankheit?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to the urinieren ausfluss, unterbauchschmerzen and blisters or warts.
But often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How you can protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
As part of the pathogen sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed through schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.
experts recommend that, especially in frequently changing sexpartnern regular investigations.
Early diagnosed most STI cured and complications can be avoided.
By patenschaften, donations and, last but not least the gagen, which the choir in Germany ersingt, some comes together.
"overall, we have already sent about 200 000 euros after esitjeni," says Annette lennartz, the chairman of the Association.
In the village itself managed zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, the money from Germany.
They also cares that the orphans unterkommen well, at one of the grandmothers about.
The gogos, how the old women in zulu called, are the base of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at aufgenommen, give you a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day just in time for school.
Anyone who has nobody comes to schutzhaus khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cooks, the every day for more than 200 hungry children cooking.
In addition," voices for Africa "launched a nähschule, two hühnerhäuser built and together with the American gesundheitsorganisation PSI organisiert make that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not to be taken for granted, because the disease across the country also is so obvious, it is silent on loved ones dead.
a king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually remarkable in a country in which the King officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
polygamy of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to the officially sanctioned way of life that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers, carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms there would be on every corner, says Annette lennartz," but the rarely used.
The culture is different - in flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the imbongi-chor travels every two or three years together by the South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black selbstbewusstsein that many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the days of apartheid.
a bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition is not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce abgetrotzt grenzsoldaten some tears.
The journey is always after esitjeni, where the singer visit their own.
Even if the small village on landkarten hardly findet, in the valley of the ezulweni-flusses is more than known.
"After esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
And if the 8733 kilometer luftlinie to Heidelberg returns to the pumping singers in the rehearsal room on the bergheimer street lights, then you can see it here.
messenger: NASA discovered ice on the mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet mercury ice.
The ice cover is may be up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as stated in three studies published on Thursday in the journal "science".
The probe messenger have found evidence that the permanently in the shadow of the region of the planet is the ice sheet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.

Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes are growing - and the insights they provide, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale-teleskop in palomar-observatorium near San Diego the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.

The drive through the talysch-gebirge wildromantisch socio-chic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could argue that it would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic group of talyschen that not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and aserisch and very durable.
endstation lerik.
The small town of flaunts to wuchtig geratener architecture of Soviet times, so don't want to fit into the picturesque mountains.
tourists from Europe hardly come here, too onerous is the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only einspurig.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not yet arrived here in the province.
But pilata fatulayeva (48) is convinced that lerik the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the eurovision-song-festival famous - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here is the life of about eight dozen talyschen documented from the area, the older than 100. fatulayeva shows a schwarz-weiß-foto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago a child conceived
But controversial star of the museum is the keeper şirali müslümov, become the 168 years old should be.
, however, there is a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old, müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he should still have a daughter testified.
Has şirali müslümov so charged in his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, altersforscher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the hochbetagten in Central Asia.
"Many hochaltrige people there are also striking in some areas of China, Japan or the hunza-tal in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of documents is, however, no scientific proof of the age to lead, especially personenstandsregister were missing.
Day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around lerik remarkably often reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why live here in the south so many hochbetagte?
The aserische reiseführer Farid mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes of talyschen.
Museum director Ms. fatulayeva dagegen believes that it's diet chaiselongue.
But cutting the kalorienreiche diet of talyschen love should be so healthy, especially the meat, bread and dairy products and many of whom daily drink a glass of melted butter, dietary is not just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of lerik, lives rubaba mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it is for this broad still relatively young.
mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a butterfass that you tirelessly hin- and herrollt.
eight people live here under one roof, including one from mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Also two children jump around.
In the kitchen is how guests tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen armadu-gläsern is served.
mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in reih and link, under your headscarf hides it long, dunkelblonde braids, her son before us reveals proud.
I have my hair always washed with milk, so you I never went out and retained their color.
"shampoo, I have never used," says mirzayeva.
monthly pension is enough for Life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once in the supermarket food bought.
Then tells of her husband, who was in the army.
Worst it was in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar aliyew" took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is being driven by the nation's vaterfigur, ruled the country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan old.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), gets mirzayeva monthly pension, for local conditions, a sum that you can live well.
And perhaps it is also mirzayevas lñngst ergrauter son right: "the old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, caring and are happy.

As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the rechtsprechung reasons on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
It was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will exploit the vague wording and the attendant legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one new hinzugeführter article: in all issues relating to Sharia law should the al-ashar-universität zurate be drawn, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would result in de facto the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much in the verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military should continue to be maintained.
These courts dienten during Mubarak's rule to repression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator were up to 11,000 civilians in militärhaft.
The state should also, so it is in the draft," protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and promote their morals and values. "
This is legally as vague wording that state institutions with the help of this Article might even control the content of film and literature.
In klartext means nothing other than censorship.
No Article übrigens lays down ausdrücklich equality between men and women.
This is another to insult the prophet Mohammed and his messengers or to slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
As dubious is the wording of the "insult to the people" is banned.
Is there has been a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of jurists?
open to interpretation, as much in the draft, the mursi to sign before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented for referendum.
"The revolution is returned"
The opposition is becoming organised for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to topple the Charter, before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said hamdin sabbahi drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-chef the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft Constitution belong "on the scrapheap of history."
kurznachrichtendienst via Twitter he accused the anhänger mursis, want to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he exclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it," said the opposition jasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet gesühnt," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be to want to monitor, making it void.
"the Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew ihrerseits to gegendemonstration, cautiously but not in Tahrir Square, but after a massengebet on the other bank of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the salafisten attended and shouting: "the people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded by mursi: "A cleanse the country!" and beteuerten: "the Koran is our Constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably bürgerkriegsähnliche zustände heraufbeschworen.
The mursis anhänger clearly did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood do declared, both the opponents of verfassungsentwurfes and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights, not even before"
Hafez Abu saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, who until February and all social forces einbinden should have gone.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (eohr) defended the Muslim Brotherhood do, when they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their belief, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"and now is the word 'human rights not even in the new Constitution," he complained in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
mursi machtausweitung on all three powers in the state because the lawyer resignieren.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"rather than strengthening civil society, you have the President de facto aside," laments saeda.
But without civil society organisations a democracy cannot work.
saeda feels alone, even by the international community, the ideological richtungskampf along the Nile regarded with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
rakfisk from Norway: is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
Could the secret of success of the country have anything to do with the local appetite for fairly übelriechenden fish?
Take a selection überreifer cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
and leave you there a week.
Just about must be the nasenbetäubenden smell of rakfisk vorstellen, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not disappear.
rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which - depending on how stinkend its fish would have you believe - up to a year in water fermentiert.
When the darkness in Norway on the country, and the weather is colder, strömen Norwegians to a celebration here in fagernes, this is dedicated to, well, really very impressive specialty.
"you can eat it raw and then into it with a glass of aquavit down," says havard halvarsen, actually in the local feuerwache works, but as a so-called "rakfisk-general" the festival was held.
around us people eat small fischwürfel and take large amounts of alcohol.
"mansche people dislike the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says havard.
The spirituose can replace the smell.
I eat some bites.
If it avoids rakfisk in nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride behind it.
rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoche, when there was no kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in the autumn in air-tight salzwasserfässern was drenched.
In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol gedämpften senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and traveled mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a buoyant labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long ago was much richer than Norway, strömen immigrants.
rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, if strictly riechender part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud EUR\ xC2 10.
Norway does not often in the world's media, and most people this does not seem to disturb.
Here hasst it still, different Breivik to name - those racist right-wing extremists, the 77 men, women and children, last year.
Instead, it is only to the "incident on 22\ xC2 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in your peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Norway is primarily responsible for today's wealth since the early 1970's, the growth of the world's largest oil and gasindustrien.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is us so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with reifem rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and the pungent blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are, as the saying goes - sensible people.
her English is just like the most people here makellos.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - dealt a large part of the branchenerträge is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years up to the global economic crisis, all with money to throw, it does not owned Norway his wallet firmly closed.
"as long as we can go skiing in the winter and summer hiking, we are happy," says Anna.
"and of course rakfisk eat," adds you with unbeschwertem laugh.
I am in the snow and am for another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
So a elch-burger is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening is again the stinkefisch on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations, which organise a rakfisk-dinner, in which guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging geruchssinne - fish.
There is a live-tv-schaltung with a fly bekleideten showmaster, of plates with rakfisk is surrounded.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor-jürgen?"
"Here are our points, havard."
You klatscht and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But perhaps it is the strict dunst of whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique pena nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique pena nieto prepared for his office, analyzed will grant from the BBC the challenges facing him and the mixed emotions of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday it was always a ring of steel errichtet, several key verkehrsrouten absperrt in the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The goal, it was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from Parliament to achieve.
On Saturday, Mexico's New President Enrique pena held the präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe calderons, Mexico can work well economically, but the country is in the grip of a drogenkriegs, which already has claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My Government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said pena held earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, was pena held as Governor of his heimatstaats Mexico tätig.
In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the divided opinions about the new head of state.
A direct Man
In the remote town of Valle del bravo they remember, for example, like to him.
Residents of the resort of write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can go on one of the highways, the pena nieto build, and are a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that were here once.
plaques with his name are outside of a modern sportcentrum and of an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel pena nietos olvera Hernandez, a congressman for the party, the PRI works.
In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 replaced by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Los pinos präsidentenpalasts great expectations of Enrique pena held.
Accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct person, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state not many people share that view of their former governor.
In association, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.
The beginning of this year, the military was switched to the drug gangs operating in the districts, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spots brachland near a large mülldeponie were left alone in the last two years the bodies of dozens of murders of women.
During the term of Governor pena held were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics pena nietos are of the opinion that he at least is not adequately addressed the problem of murders during his term.
But in the worst case have his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the heruntergekommene quarter, fighting irinea buendia with tears, as it shows me photos of their late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived in your home, it seemed as if your body was washed," recalls senora buendia.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the leichenstarre had already used.
While their mother tells their story, looks from the Wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross angebracht that wears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me, as if I a schwätzerin, unruhestifterin, nörglerin.
keeps you want you just accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if there were so many flaws and omissions," she says.
If President pena held on Saturday the präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to deal with this problem.
"I hope that as President, he is as he was as Governor," says the pri-kongressabgeordnete olvera in Valle del bravo.
But just afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.
The prosecutor claims: Bradley Manning have not complaining about abuse
The public prosecutor against Bradley mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison

The corporal of the US army is accused of thousands of confidential documents to have stolen
The public prosecutor's office on Friday tried to note that the armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about his allegedly suffered abuse in militärhaft.
In a cross-examination mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing at FT. Meade, Maryland maj. ashden fine that documents to weekly visit, the gefängnisbeamte while mannings neunmonatiger haftzeit made in quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment showed.
A day before the cross-examination, the following a request by the defense to the refusal of the trial was held - manning was due to the harsh prison sentence - had already been sufficiently punished manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The geheimdienstanalyst the US Army, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of, while serving in Iraq to have stolen thousands of confidential documents.
The material was then by WikiLeaks published on the Internet.
Wikileaks has manning as a source of information never confirmed.
At the hearing on Friday was fine with manning the forms by the officials after their meeting with manning during his detention in the quantico-militärgefängnis filled in, where he had from July 2010 to April 2011, verstärkten haftbedingungen eingesessen had.
The officials stellten manning questions and wrote his answers to.
As fine him he asked on Friday to the formularen manning admitted that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment had judged by the establishment as a whole as "very professional."
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had consulted manning directly on his treatment.
manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials have discussed this with him and reported to deal with these. They are not, however, been logged.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" no problems "and this was not necessarily that I said nothing at all," says manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise lind, manning also asked why he is not, as he complained about his treatment in January 2011 with a committee, which met from him a few months before mentioned on a form suizidgedanken should investigate.
manning replied, his intention during this meeting have insisted that his beobachtungsstatus to "prevention of injury" herabstufen to let.
The military said that it had him this restrictive status - a level under the selbstmordgefährdung is - to his and the protection of other assigned.
"I wanted to convince employees that it went well, and get rid of the beobachtungsstatus on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life, in my view," said manning.
manning said on Thursday his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transferred to the prison of the naval base quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was due to the heat once become unconscious.

"My world shrank to camp arafjon on this cage together," said manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was moved to quantico, manning have spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses allowed.
manning said he tried to remain in motion, because on the day was forbidden to sleep or even hinzulegen.
always have it with light sleep, from the outside in his cell eindrang.
If it is at night have turned and guards were unable to see his face, did he alert, so he zurückdreht again.
In January 2011, mannings lawyer formally appeal against the treatment mannings.
In April 2011 was manning in the militärgefängnis of Fort leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge manning also to an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday, as he had a night, sleep naked in his cell in quantico and at a morning count must be naked before guards and other prisoners.
manning had testified that he did during the counting never had the opportunity to cover, with its ceiling.
At the hearing on Friday gave manning, he made from a command of his guard closed that he can cover the ceiling, with which he could have been, should drop. He was, however, that no one had asked him.
On Thursday had manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked in the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he poses no risk to themselves.
manning officials have said that he would have the federal government for his underwear or flip-flops can use to hurt themselves, but not enough.
On this night, so said manning, were his underwear, flip-flops and glasses has been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce its hafterlebnisse at least take into account and his haftmaß, he should be at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that manning less guilty to offences committed, while other charges, which are considered too extreme to be challenged.

Among the charges against manning include the promotion of the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national verteidigungsinformationen and theft of public property or documents.
He will be found guilty of all charges, he risks a life sentence.
My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.
Many people were due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them hard times, he says
navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as confusion in made me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "de" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in zentralkalifornien and was my whole life "Mexicans".
An ethnic kürzel - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or call my friends in New York "Italians."
Later I opted for "mexikanisch-amerikanisch."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for kürzeln or hyphens,.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to get me into this language on both ends of an interview to say.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week after, when the future Mexican President Enrique pena nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues, which we expected, when the heads of these two countries meeting: immigration, drugs and trade.
pena held was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans now as high likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.
He would like to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc to model of the European Union.
And pena nieto vowed to continue the Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even if he mentioned no details on this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of ressentiment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced to leave you more than half its territory by vorgehaltenem rifle to the leadership of the country.
But for Mexicans, in centuries and not think in minutes, are memories of this event not to miss.
Therefore, once a us-regierungsbeamter even mildeste criticism of Mexico is, we hear - and among the elite of the country - in the Mexican press complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour bedrängen.
And the children montezumas proceeded on the kriegspfad.
And yet is the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. people, for the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or großelternteil - who got offered no chance in Mexico and towards the North.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is you.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have visited the American dream life, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders do not like.
It is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial a humiliating defeat and look down upon us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough.
arguing that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families not in Mexico failed, they would not be gone.
And then we would not now see caught behind the seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in the United States as a child einwanderte, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take them this evil.
While American citizen is, sees you as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong.
We love the Mexican band Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the bildungsbürgertums would resume their ties to the diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "Ambassador" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
It will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I fear, because you alone by, friends.
is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to make the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans a resentment for, as have their family members were only treated not so long ago.
hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican," than I thought.
Old fighting, New Middle East
The truce between Israel and Hamas could prove unexpected foundation for the Peace
Can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud.
Amid the usual recriminations were zahllose buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and embarked on the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in its historic conflict, is changing the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find the end.
won a war that neither lost nor is
At first glance seems optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21\ xC2 November continues, have strengthened the dieswöchigen kämpfe the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group had to even large loss.
Although several Hamas killed and 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten eingepfercht corners of the planet, it is Israel until now have not been able to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, added Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate palästinensergruppe Fatah.
And the Hamas could conclude that you have time on their side.
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken for the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most powerful Gulf States.
jubelnde hamas-anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent is - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren prägung stürzung Bashar Assad's face, to Jordan, where hamas-verbündete could threaten the king.
Under President Muhammad mursi and in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - by far the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on volksansichten.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove player Hamas, even by Israel and the United States cannot be herausgedrängt.
The Israeli hardliners, however, can draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defence system," Iron dome," can prove has, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel is quiet can sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States unwavering in their position and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest gewalteskalationen.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the sperranlagen, in the West Bank and therefore in the body of an eventual Palestinian State hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal under international law, but continue to be developed.
Netanyahu is as well. His Likud party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren allied group.
Why this hinterlistigen Palestinians verhätscheln and handed them a state of their own?
If you actually have control over the West Bank, they would not like their supporters in Gaza and rockets firing?
No, it is better to keep it behind the wall in check and to punish, if you dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail. But the Arab Spring could make them a win in the final.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries in seats, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's verteidigungsetat is larger than of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments little help to repair its economy.
For the pragmatic President mursi with Barack Obama zusammentat, in order to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era symbolisieren.
Also Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world take tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue their selbstbestimmungsrechtes deprived - a powder keg, which no doubt will one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
bloody missions to suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years will increasingly take its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost from outside
The right answer is that the vernünftigeren representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes gebiete abtritt.
The hope is that the cease-fire outsiders - for the near future small - granted more power to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now together with Turkey and Qatar the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to stop Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming un-beobachterstatus application.
Obama must also play its part, to encourage Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he failed the idea of his own peace plan.
far away in the White House, it seems as if it were just a participation averse.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform zigarettenverpackungen treten in force
Health warnings and ill body parts on neutral Green packs, are the same for all tabakmarken
The world's first laws for single zigaretten- and tabakverpackungen came into force in Australia. markenlogos and Colors will be replaced by neutral, olive lid, which, moreover, with dramatic images are printed, the sick body parts and by cigarette smoke show ill babies and children.
Apart from the various health warnings and pictures from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, in the same small font abgedruckt.
That leads Australia the world's strictest rules for tabakverpackungen.
The Australian federal government wants to deter young people from smoking by the glamorous image of the tobacco is removed.
This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% -iger probability, then no longer will start.
"You can already see in children young age that you understand the message, the tobacco companies try to apply with your brand," says bundesgesundheitsministerin tanya plibersek. For example, you cited studies that have shown that children a logo with the idea of the Crown Princess associate.
Although Australia has one of the lowest raucherquoten the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, consider other countries already have similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was, with the laws would the black-market trade favours, which will lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"the law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott mcintyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra ha of zico import pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for zigarettenetuis and silikondeckeln to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with its challenge to the laws scheiterten.
zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and waiting for new stocks.
For us, it is a good business.
According to experts, is the hole in the popularity of social media at exactly the population, directed to the plan.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from advertising, it banned them from acting as sportsponsoren and most dealers forced to cigarettes in shops no longer auszulegen changed. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local businesses and pages, but it has no influence on international sites.
"If tobacco markets and has left only a small area to promote its products, to the Internet is not around," says becky freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, freeman brands noted a rise in reports of "ordinary people" were drawn up.
We must ask the question: is this just a private person, as the great service to marlboro-zigaretten findet, having even incorporates a video - or has a marketing agency to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing to focus to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules - those countries at the World Trade Organisation complain about unfair handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia operates.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid 2013.
According to plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries, the similar verpackungsgesetze consider.
Canada was the first country in 2001, the fotografische warnungen vorschrieb.
Meanwhile, these extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show trotzig.
Images does not affect me.
I ignore it.
"You simply take a stake and is the box way," says Victor El hage when buying a cigarette packet, in a photograph with a mundtumor abgedruckt is.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tabakhandels "king of the pack" in the centre of Sydney, says that the single verpackung have the filling his shelves more difficult.
"in the past I needed an hour to a delivery einzusortieren, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes - then we would have told us, that's okay, we close," he visibly angry adds.
Time to be bored in a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful,
This thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not lie.
half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iphones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and kindesentwicklungsexperten führen boredom as something positive.
When it comes to you, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, potentially promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, we will no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom.
So we should the boredom welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
This I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not.
"Indeed, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The hauswände pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom actually.
John D. eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that is the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea before a fokusgruppe of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as they want to experience," a satisfactory activity, but this cannot be able to "define.
boredom is different from apathy, therefore, to the effect that the person is not employed, but that would be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to "disruption of the aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
boredom is therefore almost as to listen to as depression.
However, Professor eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes, we believe that US is boring, even if we only have difficulties to focus.
In their study," the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention "- in English, about:" The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, "which was published in September in The Journal perspectives on psychological Science", Professor eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants zuhörten tape, on which a person a magazinartikel vorlas.
Some groups heard a loud TV from the neighbouring region that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group had heard these sounds not at all.
The people who barely audible television heard, made to feel more bored than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding job, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says mark J. fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of guelph In Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you prefer a monotonous work exercised - "as the search for faulty products to a fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even fight by people physically remain attentive.
"studies have shown that children who herumhampeln dürfen, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sitting still," says Professor fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a "scale in the 1980s to langeweileanfälligkeit."
On the scale are statements such as "many of the things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers found that young is more boring than girls, so Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of westflorida - particularly with regard to the need for more and greater diversity externer reize.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter haufen.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment by, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of teenagers in school were doing homework and the bored, while 23% data to be bored, if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents gave, to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on your alltagsablauf.
back to my ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"with the boredom to the brain a saying that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know what you should do it best.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and to cook, will be happy.
But television can provide glücksgefühle in the short term, but these verflüchtigen long-term again.
So who's bored child an iPad is enough, but they can turn it off the boredom. It has not learned to talk or to control themselves, says Professor fenske.
And he adds: "selbstkontrolle transfers from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also receives more selbstkontrolle in other areas.
I do not believe that we should boredom celebrate.
We should also not see too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us off the permanent aktivitäts- and technologieberieselung wohlzufühlen.
Professor eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so as to be more boring to us. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only look for a way to shut down and relax.
"in an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to beschäftigen, once the noise is silent."
In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marihuanagesetz
The 19-jährige Community college-student footballer Anthony orozco atbilstošs sdosten colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marihuanabrocken and a pipe that they smoked.
According to orozco, he and some friends on a septembertag travelling by car in lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was orozco for the possession of drugs and drogenutensilien vorgeladen - kavaliersdelikte, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a gerichtstermin.
"We are treated like criminals," so orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drogendelikte less from the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offences that will turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped.
The police no longer pursue adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts colorados have announced that existing marihuanadelikte weiterzuverfolgen quote and people are still in court.
At the same time are voting on it several cities, from the suburbs denvers to the western mountains, new, state licensed marihuanageschäfte to stop at the opening in their communities.
"this situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, chief of police in aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington State kratzen perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide on the establishment of a lizenzsystems for production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline until 1 December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado is ahead in any case, most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only the drug for medical purposes and then the eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called i-502, enters into force on 6 December and this is also the conclusion of a grey area, in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant praxisfragen must be resolved in this time - for example, how the government target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres to schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the conurbation of Seattle," says Ben livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, chief oates sent his staff in aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the Public Prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years, and that the police will pursue "immediately" no strafanzeigen for these offences.
Chief oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban vorgaben to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to pursue.
In weld county in the north colorados represents bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to monitor cases of marihuanabesitz, mainly to persuade consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people prosecuted for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many were also charged for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the tatzeitpunkt were crimes," ließ buck said in a statement.
reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa county, where voters rejected the marihuana-initiative ambivalent.
The police in grand junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities no longer.
bezirksstaatsanwalt pete hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to not all outstanding besitzverfahren to drop.
"I do not believe that I don't waste my time on this, to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, has been clear from the start that it would not be easy to arrange the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the State encouraged among local officials a profound dichotomy in terms of the big green experiment to days.
In bezirksstaatsanwälten if it was a "cultural barrier," said Sean mcallister, a lawyer from Denver for marihuanadelikte stehende defendants in court, and on the ground as a spokesperson for the National Organization for the reform of marihuanagesetzen operates.
"You have such a big part of their lives to prosecute people for that they spent the legalisierung still cannot accept," he believes.
The first states that treat small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national musterfälle acted for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sale, at the same time, nervous wait for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to treat as a crime.
Advocates of the legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice department will give in.
Despite several aufsehenerregender defends arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States largely gestattet.
Kevin A. sabet, former drogenpolitik-berater the Obama administration believes that kriminalbeamte is likely to be no doors of small quantities of the drugs, but probably reluctant to seize the legal under the new legislation, staatlich regulated marihuana-geschäfte to tolerate.
several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities act.
Even before the election day genehmigten some local administrators moratoriums on new marihuana-geschäfte, although this could open only in about a year.
Last week, montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the town council.
Our Community has voted against this change.
We are then, for what the Community has decided and not after, for which the state has decided.
There are still many questions.
petronella Wyatt: I was in Oxford to, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
been it has always been my biggest dream, to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once considered the world's largest wissenstempel, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance - promoted.
But within two weeks after my arrival in worscester college - there in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had my suitcase and found as the first scandal of my life again.
My father broke out in tears.
My friends were confused.
The evening standard said it, I would be gone, because I would have had a problem with that fellow students in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author a n Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged Cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
. I ran
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason, in this alleged birthplace of enlightenment so blinkered and cruel seemed now: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, is a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of tory-studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week the same gleichberechtigungsschutz forderte, benefits the schwulen, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the corpus Christi college junior common room (JCR) indicate that they are because of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in the gleichberechtigungskomitee your college, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
The situation was exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC two," Wonderland: young, bright and on the right," was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was shown, among other things, absolvent Joe cooke, a former President of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce and rode with silver suit and silberbesetztem gehstock protzte.
at other universities say conservative students, they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old luke black, Vice-President of the conservative studentenvereinigung of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "there is a growing linkstendenz at universities.
The people believe that we are like the bullingdon club, without us even kennengelernt."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and geschichtsstudent in corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-jährige stephanie cherill, president designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says she observed in jcr-mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of Members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority.
arrived as unbelievably timid 18-jährige I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year the university had voted in favour, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education to give no title.
The atmosphere would have even stalinisten aufschrecken.
In the first days of the erstsemester-woche, in the new students and tutors kennelernen, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of tory-studenten not only duldeten, but even with pleasure take part.
political issues such as bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutoriums.
In my first of these events should translate into English. I French texts from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from kuchenteig, and quite gehässig.
"refuse thatcher-anhänger, to learn French, or are you just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few französischstunden in their leisure time - so, if you are not too busy with their social activities," knurrte me Pitt.
I returned with hängendem head back in my room.
On this evening, I sat alone at dinner, as I have been easy on the shoulder tippte in college.
It was a englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the Conservative student Association presented.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father Margaret Thatcher nahesteht, so it will be worse for you.
Most tory-erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later to adjust me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A new entrant in the field as Conservative philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the current Eton College had visited, said to me: "You're the daughter of a faschistenschweins."
polluted you.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As Tories have sex?" asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation of the United States felt had to have.
Would I ever be able, at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?
I would talk only after nightfall can make?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations to suppress?
The three years that lay before me, began before my inner eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who openly admitted as a Tory, was Norman stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only for this to be a conservative, but also because he hated Thatcher in terms of foreign policy advice and had written for you talk.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found him parochial and kleinkariert and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997, he took a professorship at the University of bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I Oxford hated, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
accepted during his time in the vierzigern were all political views.
"but it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
So, not something they would never do in my city of träumenden spire.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day.
His moist eyes trübten.
Give the whole a chance.
I am sure you neckt you only.
It would break my heart, if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also tory-anhänger, had buckled under pressure and his convictions entsagt.
During a tutoriums in the following week, in which another geschichtstutor seriously had said that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I was that my parents were subjected to "brainwashing" and called them "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the final nail in the coffin of my oxford-karriere schlug.
At the time he wrote two columns in the murdoch-presse per week.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my häscher on.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can like a weinerlichen schlappschwanz nennen.
But no 18-jährige should ever in a school under such intimidation and boshaftigkeit must suffer.
And even more tragic is that it was, a University of Oxford, which not only 14 tory-premierminister hervorbrachte, but up to now hiding behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of the celebrity"
"Valentino: master of couture" at the exhibition, which opened in London this week, ABC speaks with naty abascal, Fiona thyssen-bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemachers.
Somerset house, the former home of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, the beherbergung an exhibition about Valentino garavani is worthy of.
It has recognised the designer of "Valentino: master of couture" at the opening of a superb retrospective, for the more than 130 clothes of haute couture were compiled, which were created by his "House" in the last 50 years.
"I love this Palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose single protagonist "Il signore garavani" could have been written, but not without its distinguierte clientele.
Valentino had always been fascination for the stifling and distant world of the adels.
In the first room of the exhibition, which continues until March 3, will be to see, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the erlesensten aristocracy, starting from the Princess salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess marie-chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of its social rise from modest modemacher voghera in the city in northern Italy on the international jetsets idol.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be of disadvantage.
"at least they are not on their tilt your splendid carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities out of pop music," says Baroness Fiona thyssen-bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s wohnten the two in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, more generous and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced, if we were invited to his house in gstaad," explains the exfrau of "heini" Thyssen, closely befreundet with forgotten beauties such as marella Agnelli or eugenie niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of the celebrity preferred.
And yet he is a star.
valeria mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model valeria mazza forgets the charisma of the modemachers.
Many years ago we went after a fashion on the piazza di spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music you knew and felt his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career in the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"he never comes out of fashion, because its design works of art," she says finally.
Show the origin
The lives of garavani is not a history of versessenheit, more mutual liebschaften.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 metres long catwalk, which proposes a rollentausch: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire the masterpieces of Valentino has a fantastic "audience", such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for your wedding with aristóteles Onassis chose, the costumes, the Monica vitti was in "la notte" or a coat of wool and leather, the Empress Farah diba gehörte.
In this audience modepuppen rays names such as sibilla de luxemburgo, Gloria von thurn und taxis, mette-marit from Norway, rosario of Bulgaria or sofía von Habsburg.
naty abascal and modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love," unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says naty abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him all other because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty, before," adds the ex-herzogin of feria.
I like the colours, which he used very; they have plenty of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the Princess and meinungsführende in the fashion Patricia della giovampaola d arenberg cannot forget the first time, when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of, finally the age and to have the opportunity to take one of his abendkleider...
At the end of the 1990s it finally came.
I bought my first valentino-kleid for a festival in the castle I vetters, the prince Edouard de ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a crowded top with a neckline that makes his name honour.
"It was a dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian aristokratin, who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d arenberg bewahrt their conquering the modemachers "with absolute care" to "not just because a dress is a dress, but also the memories associated with."
The "King" of the fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset house is the hochzeitskleid marie-chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modemacher his näherinnen called) were required to this elfenbeinfarbene seidenkleid with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meters long tail anzufertigen.
According to the journalist Suzy menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century," the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "savoir-être" marred the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award cavaliere del lavoro, he was appointed commandeur de l ordre des arts et des lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, kumuliert garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I am always be refinement, his calm, be gepflegtes and perfect äußeres noticed," D arenberg.
I have seen him the last time a month ago with a gala dinner in the museum de orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no traces of him."
And it says a Princess...
The most difficult job in the world: the human arbeitstiere of kawah ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they bear 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work hell is, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with anto wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by visiting sulphur from the volcano kawah ijen get in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He needs every day down on the floor of this crater, where the rise from the Earth ausströmende verfestigt sulphuric gas in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large schwefelsteine, the total can weigh up to 70 pounds, transported it in two bambuskörben further down on his shoulders on the stone paths.
There are just 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted träger need more than 40 minutes for the rise in schildkrötentempo, and you have to put the balance and keep their steps carefully so they do not slip and crash.
You know that every step you can cost lives, as a French tourist happened years ago on the slopes of the kawah ijen abstürzte.
The miner of kawah ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, reduce it.
Once at the top, as they are the way between the tourists who like zirkusaffen photograph them and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to balance that has drawn up a minengesellschaft a little further down a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT candi ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) exploiting its workers which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulphur is charged.
It sold them for every 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the production of streichhölzern feuerwerksartikeln, cosmetics, dynamite and even the pale of sugar is used.

There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but anto has returned with his family to banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason, which is so important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are hinduisten, you and I have brought to Java to convert them to Islam."

Singapore babies to save the economy needs
The singapurer blame for that you don't have children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the kindererziehung.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our bürgerpflicht and make life.
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbonbons, yet - or because of it - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper-songs, the local sayings such as "push is a" Bao "(laib) in the oven, in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency bbh, which has shot the video, is the hope that the advertising achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to the people to make their "national duty" meet.
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it a fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue to which we have had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-abenden (fast flirting).
possible that many of these ideas were creative, you, but not necessarily to success.
So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to compose?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it is 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents granted up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city-state in South-East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In its national bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, as this rate on 2 fraud - which is also known as ersetzungsrate - was in 1976.
So why not get the singapurer more children?
tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this was due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and to form a family to have far more options in relation to lebensziele and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single and the delay marriage and geburten, whose outcome is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, aimed at a drastic increase in zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, to be criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already have an impact on the housing market.
The Agency for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "schuhschachteln" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are an area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales.
However, there is the concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction of large apartment for families to build.
But Lim Yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company El developers, says that his "schuhschachteln" much faster than larger apartments sell.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that you are very much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been put obstacles in the way, if you too many small units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the talks with the singapurern, working in the financial district, to show that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get other.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that you cannot have children.
That is why the singapurer have the last word, when it comes to have children - because the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary is the property privately or "the area of private life, where the right to protection against any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to their everyday life and the social networks?
He understands the risks to which he exposes, if he makes situationen known on the Internet, which he would not share in real life?
El periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which often are on the net.
In four of the cases linked the concept with "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and user," if you apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not be known in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge in an attempt, the importance of "private" in Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and windows live messenger to explain where he has accounts for two years.
"This is very confidential secrets, my mother would know, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On fb I invite beautiful images or pictures of play high.
I vertreibe me my time with friends.
"I would not share photo, which is not from me, or from someone who the imbecile power," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos of naked, from crime, or abusive or violent comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has in fb and nine folger in Twitter.
Most are related.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
I reported on Twitter to express myself and interesting tweets to write.
"I do not know if someone answers, I invite you only high" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak with relatives or friends in the distance quickly" he is.
asked he says that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone a strange empfähle him, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts into Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask and ask it to have 20 of the people not to know that he has attached his friend.
"It scares me, not because we have something in common, for example, music," he is.
After giving the young asked him or made him no comments after his address or telephone number.
"When someone afflicted me or you simply asked of me, I remove him from my account" is it.
José appeared to ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The young are not unfamiliar experiences that we know today as cyberbullying.
The well-known a friend was in a social network to ransom.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"he has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José has not closed the victim the account.
"he has made it only privately."
Then he explains a number of steps to ensure an account konfigurieren.
In contrast to Jorge would this young upload photos of famous in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that, if he is unsympathetic to me or I him one auswischen wants.
"But I know that this cyberbullying is" he explains.
Key issues
marielos porras, teacher of English with degree in education and learning, says that to be guided to the children and young people must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, with the release of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
porras explains that the academics Marc prensky, owner of a master-titels in education at Yale University and author of the book "digital natives and immigrants" these concepts to explanation of the phenomenon was.
Are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, who they should teach, where we even learn" he says.
He says that this is a complex issue," because we are asking of you, that you have a defined criteria about what verbreitet, can be said or published, and this in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They should also be fussy when it is most important to you to be popular, thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, what is privacy, asking you questions, which brings you to think.
"to tell you, they should not do it, does not work," he says.
porras nennt anschließend some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
or, if you like, when you published a photo of you, such as the one you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the other about you publish?
You have the other people previously asked for permission, if you have photos of feiern labelled?
And one more question: should all know what you do in every moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
Are the same rules.
"someone outside of the Internet is with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
estuardo Guardia, university professor, grundschullehrer and educational consultant, says that it is essential that the parents carefully read the directives of social networks.
If you understand all sections, you have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the eröffnens one account on the Internet.
"for example, the age, or what they can share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia must be remembered the children to the lesson "thou shalt not speak with foreign."

"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) participated, which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and other conflicts umbrachten" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the Member States of the UNASUR forward.
"the free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors, seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President also advocated Ecuador the redesign of the Organisation of American States (oea) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
The lessons, undertake never to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted the Ecuador.
Correa said that he does not regret this decision, because he was so as not to betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" has fulfilled.
He added that it was "reasonable suspicions have given that Assange be delivered to a third country and procedures would not observed."
He also criticised the Swedish prosecutors have demanded of him, to give him an interrogation on its territory because of alleged sexualdelikts, while "the Swedish legislation allows this via a video conference, which could have been carried out on the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be compromised.
"since he is in our message is, I have not spoken to him, the Ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the head of state in Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he take physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"that would affect the health of every people," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of a freibriefs is, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that Europe's lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we are this word in this case not to, there have been constant discussions, however.
"the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various European bodies leads," he said.
And "if Britain this licence granted tomorrow, I believe that this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype verhörte, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he can tolerate," the mediocrity, not the evil intention and dispel the lie, the freedom of expression."
"the greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In that sense it beglückwünschte that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists', and not by the bankers or hegemonischen and spießbürgerlichen countries," and took vorweg that he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least up to the next elections, and he argued that the body "must be hard and not opportunism and not as legal verkleideten coup stattgeben darf," because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte to negotiate with Nicaragua seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, for "absolutely right."
Currently this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully treated so that they can overcome and look to the future.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, international bodies to call if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
In relation to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he gave that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very hard."
Correa assured that, if he losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
power has never interested me personally, but under unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I draw me from public life back.
This also applies, if we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba relation.
I have just spoken with the Vice-President of Venezuela, nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned for a routine treatment would have travelled there, and that is that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It is in any case a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took part today in Lima on the 6th summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to provide for a sustainable progress, equality, and security.
cause of a die due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the untersuchungsergebnis confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "abzuschwächen tried."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to care just about his illness and started to be informed, and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the hiv-einheit hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), in which he came after several fighting in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of imss to adopt," because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to this syndrome with quality of life to survive.
However, there are still many people in the clinic, which know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already has harmed and exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that is the date of the first reported cases," the great success today, means that the survival of patients, the treatment starts on time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the hiv-einheit of hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
An expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment depended, and that those would have greater opportunities that are not drogenabhängig: up to 30 years in a census of 200 cd4 and 50 years for a census of 500 cd4.
Simply put, mean that the above speech, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis hiv-positiv gets "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report), it is still true that reduced the Onusida) Since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the patients died entered into the national database.
alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005 have universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
- Why so people still die from it?
- in my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no versorgungsprobleme in the drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state come because you do not know your infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: "nine out of ten patients have come to us if you already have an accompanying infektion. earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, which is why all people, where this is necessary, massive screening tests should be offered."
This proposal are the experts and officials of the consejo habilidad de prevención del Sida en Jalisco (coesida) (state Committee to aids-vermeidung in Jalisco) and Fabrizio patients how to carry out the test at a private laboratory ließ, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already was in the aids-phase and even the kaposi's sarcoma (had a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and don't want to hear.
"If I have to die, then to burst," says three times in my case.
The change was to improve, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, go much, have an active, but responsible sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio count on the agreed to share his intimate details with milenio Jalisco, in his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global aids-tages fear.
They should make the test, if you belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to like all people can live responsibly.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this particular locations "was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.
"Why do you need?" is a common spottfrage, orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and by social workers in the health care system, the young people don't want to suspend, assured the correspondent.
He proposed to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but are in ausgabegeräten in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It is not be promoting promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González in response to the question, whether under his administration präservative would be distributed.
"sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
of Jalisco schlüsseldaten
There are 13.435 kumulierte cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).

After the Court of Appeal has confirmed the United States a judgment, which does not recognise the group's restructuring of verbindlichkeiten vitro, which was reached on a handelskonkurs in Mexico, there is a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in neighbouring countries, the insolvency.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the ruling by the judge handed down on June 15 harlin hale in bancarrotas on court for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican company the seizure of their property on the other side of the river bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the largest glashersteller in Mexico's decision opens the door to call because three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge thing to point out that the creditors must be subject to bankruptcy law of the United States, says the Court of Appeal of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans first that it is in the main the handelskonkurs dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures in default by companies with länderübergreifendem profile is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations modellgesetz created for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute was used as simple.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the societies to recognise the liabilities of the bankrupt estate, the branches of vitro with its parent company, did not have the majority required for the restructuring of debt would be accomplished.
However, this possibility of the Mexican laws recognised.
Actually vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including agremex and comercial mexicana, whose obligations under companies of the group from the Instituto federal de concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for handelskonkurse) confirmed.
It is true also that after deduction of the voices of the branches of vitro, the creditors, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro complained, i.e. the geier-fonds such as aurelios capital, aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, a majority had achieved.
assumed the vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is from the court of appeal not taken into account.
On the other hand, there are vitro blame for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the serious economic crisis in the United States, where it blows away.
For this reason, the family González sada before the same berufungsgericht contradiction, so that the vote in plenary erfolgt, i.e. all the judges, because only three of them voted.
The is not granted, the cerciorare-einspruch eingelegt, which calls for a review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the Court a document aside, that was sent by the Government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court), what the in vitro procedures carried out within the framework of the law on handelskonkurse described, and what it is pointed out that it had kept strictly to the agreements signed by both countries to meet the konkursgesetzes Chapter 15 of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, i.e. the established rules for cross-border insolvency cases that guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
zweibandige karambole: a blow for vitro and for the country.

Héctor "hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life"
The Warriors of the team, Héctor "hetin" Reyes, was connected to the korbsport longer than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of each of the country as Héctor "hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, was rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it a player of the first National League, Attorney and head of the lower classes, all with the vaqueros de bayamón or President of the basketballverbands.
"my life I have drafted in basketball many hats, even several at the same time, when I was President of the bsn, chief executive of the national team and President of the Association in the 1990s," recalled Reyes with a visit of Primera hora bayamón at home with him, where he was with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The Walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and they show.
bayamón in the
The emotionalsten memories are those who recall his time at the vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old jubiläum as mitgeschäftsführer or director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships vaqueros since 1967 it as Managing Director, mitgeschäftsführer durfte or trainer.
There were many erfüllende years, including the five championships succedingly from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome mincy bsn.
From then," cuco "ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that my genes bartow, here as a trainer, and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
You want to it? "
And that was the beginning of mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
bartow recommended after the freiwurfspezialisten Raymond gausse, einbürgern ließ and one of our best werfer was.
I remember, as he said that, if mincy had a championship for bayamon allows gausse would provide a further.
The championship the vaqueros with gausse was granted him, but even from a distance out, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he moved it to its application and to enjoy the mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been repeated, the recent US move for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best national team, that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those in the 2004 Olympics against the dream team won.
But my favourite is the team of panamerikanischen games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team offered a fight to the United States, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only mincy gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "piculín" (ortiz) again here, but also the young players (Javier) "toñito" colón and James Carter, León (brothers Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, the 1990 due to a knieverletzung could not be there.
A team, which perhaps was not the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal and the US, was the great joy of the upcoming tournament in 1995 neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "canito" Nieves, Pablo alicea and the young Rolando hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events in the panamerikanischen play in Mar del Plata, we gained entgegen every prognose the gold medal.
Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt piculín ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level so as piculín.
And this, without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We have had a number of good coach as Julio toro, flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau armandito Torres.
Of the young I like the work of Leo arill well.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the bsn at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season included.
What will you still to do?
There are things I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in ponce, for example only play in your area and only in the national playoffs meet with teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children unnecessary many travel and games.
At least, I see the result of compulsory training and courses for trainer, tisch-offizielle and referee.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I listen to music, see videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and I can go to a basketballspiel.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.

The dramatic series of fernsehkette CBS on the ewing-clan and other figures in the environment was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.

The beginning of the course, the "end of the world" studied
each week the students examine apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the religionsprofessor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he has an irresistible angelhaken had: the end of "long rückwärtszählung" of maya-kalenders on 21 December, which many people believed that it means the end of the world.
But charmé had no idea what it should expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane sandy, which some have referred to as "deudarmaggedon" as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that ever existed," said charmé this week the students at the University of rutgers-camden (New Jersey).
If someone analysed, what happened in the world today, as if we had thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apokalyptischer mentality.
And he is not the only professor of this semester, which should really be the last in the history lessons on the "end of the world" offers.
In temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry vacker the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
each week the students examine apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way that hypothetical scenarios are offered, which lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, analyzed the students movies with apokalyptischem content and studied how they are compared with the real life compare ließen.
"I have tried to inform the students, what possible, probably, credible and is impossible," said vacker.
at the University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew restall hauptcampus Amara solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "the end of the world."
"We are not in 2012, so we always keep the option to hold the course again, in the event that the world does not go under," said restall.
In spite of the "impending doom" students must study, projects create and participate in abschlussprüfungen.
In Penn state, the abschlussprüfung carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, why the students have no other chance, allegedly as "to continue working until night, where the world comes to an end," said restall.
Courses were very popular.
"in two hours, there was no more places," said restall on its course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students.
For weeks before semesterbeginn we received e-mails from students who asked whether more places are available.
The students, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to themselves to console," said bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in rutgers-camden for religion and soziologie haddonfield, New Jersey.
The Apocalyptic sekten- or religionsmentalität is really only a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student wants wekesa of psychology and nursing said to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he gave.
I enjoy.
But none of the students surveyed, and much less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project, treated the prophecy of the mayas, and in certain ways discredit it," said Julie zeglen, student last year in temple, 21 years old and from west Chester.
The mayas predicted never the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said restall.
He notes, however, that in the Western society an apocalyptic fear is the back several centuries, when the people responding to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased that speculation.
"elsewhere, people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly in the englischsprechenden world the case.
Joseph dougherty, informed a religionsprofessor la salle University, which this year in the Philippines, responded quickly to the question of whether he would know in a course on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as allusion to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
restall pointed out that over the years many days from the last court referred to, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December," the people immediately think of a new date "or about philosophierten that the December 21, the beginning of a seven-year period is that would be the end of the world.
students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that you want to go to celebrate on "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
