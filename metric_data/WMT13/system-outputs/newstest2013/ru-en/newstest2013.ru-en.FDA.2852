Republican strategy of resistance to the reintroduction of Obama ’ s election
Republican leaders justified its policy to deal with the spin in the election.
However, in the Бреннана believe this myth, arguing that cases of fraud in the election in the United States more rare than deaths from the impact of lightning.
Besides lawyers Republicans have counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One can say with certainty: These new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states bear the responsibility for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
This is why most of the state governments since 2009 pass laws, усложняющие the registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November 2010, which brought so 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only for one 2011 was taken 180 draft laws that restrict the right to vote in the state.
New election laws require voter to ID with a photograph and evidence of the presence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws are cutting the absentee voting, the right упраздняют voter registration in the day and take away the right to vote for citizens who have has been removed from official records.
Before the 2006 elections no US state not обязывал voters to present identification with a photograph.
Indiana has become the first state, which has such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana.
Republican officials rushed to spread this practice and in other states.
Over the past two years, they have policies that commit voters to make a photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identification card, as well as medical insurance.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, then there are 21 million people, under the necessary for the voting age, do not have a photo ID, from the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
While the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars.
New restrictions диспропорционально affect the young, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African American men, 15% of people, easily earn less than $35,000, 18% of the people over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years does not have the required photo ID.
But that is not all.
Students - voters, which, as it is considered, vote for candidates from Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational institution.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state is not required evidence of the American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, this requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Starting in 2011, more than ten states have laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures, obviously, aimed to limit the vote from Latin America.
It is considered, that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters on the day of voting in eight states.
They also have limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who wish to register.
This restriction is not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign to the registration of voters helped make in lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, brought down by 17% level registering new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition to Republican lawmakers adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of absentee voting.
So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted, were moving ahead, even though the last accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters.
The same thing happened with come from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of the voters, they accounted for 24% of the people who voted earlier.
In contrast to the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted earlier were only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers-Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft legislation was ветировано state governors-democrats.
The most ambiguous laws were halted with the intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States.
This has enabled in part to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have laws requiring or photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules who joined the action, of course, will make it hard suffrage in 2012.
Criticism from Democrats denounce bias laws, which were taken, seeing in them an obvious appeal to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The report from Бреннана 2011 demonstrates that states, these laws are 171 from 270 votes needed in the electoral college, to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one, of course: These new regulations will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.
Screening prostate cancer: Pass the test or not?
In fact, the test on Majoris gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to бесполезному medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to passage диспансеризацию from which begin to doubt even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked opinion two specialists.
A study in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups investigated, so the received data are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out which-or clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different level of mortality in those patients who underwent screening, and those who do not.
This study also found, after a 12-summer the observation that the likelihood of a метастаз on 30-40% higher than those who did not screened.
So, I would recommend pass test starting from 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men African-American origin also are at increased risk.
The key point is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer was detected.
Cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.
Patient need to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him a possible options, without a prostate cancer treatment, which is safe for life in the long run, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for disease.
Today, many men who revealed the cancer will not pass the course of treatment, as their cancer is not offensive and is not a threat to life.
We let them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we start treatment.
Increasingly we with precision define criteria for deciding who should or should not be course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend all-still pass the test.
But it is also important consult with your doctor to determine whether or not, it is necessary to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Мовембер created a tool that allows you to assess all for and against passing the test on Majoris.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in scientific research, the healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is considered, that if all people cool питались and enough moving, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented.
"If no one was smoking, that figure has risen to at least up to 50%," emphasizes André Болье, the press-secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by наследственностью.
Several types of cancer remain completely (CDS).
For the Canadian Association of cancer fighting smoking remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking linked to 85% of cases of cancer of the lung.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It deals huge damage to the health of the people.
"Even today, in Quebec has 1.5 million smokers," says the press-secretary of André Болье.
The ASEAN Regional Forum fact: Ten years after abandoning Area the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the data of a kind, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus and pancreas and cervix.
"Studies show that routine physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer," - add in Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat.
Too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Should avoid also sausages.
The preservation of the meat by Salad, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The past can damage cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer", - just follow in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists on the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies could not be called a single.
According to the SCC, research vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed lower risk of prostate cancer, then another gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D and there is no full clarity.
However, n-Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and the family anamnesis, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Interim analysis does not cause cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
In the summer of eating a message about what scientists may be able to discover the Higgs boson, provoked a boom, and not without reason.
It is considered, that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, as many.
In addition, this is the latest particle whose existence has been predicted in the framework of the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter - but that previously could not find an experienced by.
But physicists have still not sure that the question is about бозоне Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted General model.
In addition, the new data presented this week in one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, that is confirmed, although to some of the data is not reaches.
Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Higgs, as well as make chances seem to be minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, гласящий that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
To work around this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.
But although particle physics is quite strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: The Pauli exclusion principle, which постулирует that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "certain state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
Proceeding from this, physics of share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called фермионами that sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli.
In the other, the суетятся бозоны, гнусная Banda anarchists who have no respect to anything – at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно turn out to be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, absolutely wonderful) Particle Adventure at Berkeley, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: Meson, about which we can talk, and we will not force particles "," through which are the basic forces of nature and to which in some way, Higgs boson.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creature, as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly банальному бозону: Фотону, or "fountains of light", which is "by courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with the electrical charge, is accelerating or changes direction, it is "violates the" electromagnetic field in this region, roughly as stone, to the pond.
From this "human" is born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than as фотоном - and, therefore, one of бозонов "host forces."
More stable field
Much the same is true with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this boson appeared, should be "broken" different field, the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field is much, much stable electromagnetic fields; to stir up, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a pond замерзшем, surface which could offend only a very large stone.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN is the Large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is intended for an explanation of the relationship between бозоном Higgs and weight.
Indeed, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others is not: A sheet of paper, for example, never itself will not keep in the fridge.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who interact, have a lot of, while others (as intensity, by the way) it does not have.
So, what "can do" all of these studies, asks of membrane-Plamondon?
In science, they are used for testing the accuracy of General Model (SM), and it is also allows physicists find a divergence between the results and forecasts SM.
Besides, some of them passionately to crave such divergence was found, as the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "a new physics" and former some holes Models.
The latter, however, still have significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which is approximately 80% of the Universe (oops-oops!).
But while at CERN such disparities are not found.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person to predict more difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: At the beginning of the 60-x ’ s pioneers in the use of the laser research laboratories Bella could not even imagine what the revolution will bring their work.
They had anticipated their applications in science, but not much more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960 was invented in the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that the laser was seen more as "gadget lab."
Imagine...
And besides, the application can найтись for instruments, accompanying the study.
For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although this does not was its original purpose, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras and deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Долг"
The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed delicate question the end of life.
The debate will soon should be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill.
However, in this important area, there is still much work to do.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, разрушавший it from within, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the orphanage of palliative care Victor-Гадбуа in Belœil where arrived on the eve of.
"But it is always shock, this is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its job: Unbelievable weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even yourself to eat.
Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees that had helped him to eat.
He бодрится, even manages to smile, to talk with strangers who work around it, bring it, do it in the bath.
Courage in front of a death.
"My greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is demeaning," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the medicine from this malaise.
"In the course of life teaches us that a man should мочиться standing", - Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа.
Regress to the status of a child - for some an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the human capacity" to come to terms with the rebound, he argues.
As, in the opinion of many people engaged in паллиативным departure, important events случаяются and at the height of this decline.
Patients who come to the shelter паллиативный Victor-Гадбуа, all with cancer.
Forecasts they look to for a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called "medical".
G-membrane A., 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of the car."
But the disease which has enabled me to know their children.
"I have a good children", she added.
"I want nothing more in my life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, облегчающую breath.
It still-awaits in the coming days last visit his son, you from Italy.
In the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food.
This is паллиативный care, which remains when that nothing can be done.
To make the death of more comfortable.
In Quebec on every 11 700 residents have one place in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
Here life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors on the streets.
Whether the comfort of the physical, emotional or privilege.
Police we agree to provide ротовые gurgling of brandy or пепси, he asks.
Diabetics we don ’ t impose control the level of sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we brought beer, well-X, who died today at night.
In the morning, his son допил this beer in my legs from the late.
"We help relatives, as well as patients", - Natalie Savard, director of care for the sick.
In the orphanage Victor-Гадбуа nor one day not similar to the previous one.
Next to the 93-years old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and all перепробоваший, in order to survive.
"In the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancerous sick in the age of 45 years," - озабоченно says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients, taken to a shelter Victor-Гадбуа, arriving from home, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to care паллиативному
It is considered, that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному care, you have to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering patients, in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-Гадбуа and the Society of palliative care at home the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancerous sick.
It is this a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in паллиативному care to fear the adoption of the law, and there are some легализирующего assistance in suicide.
Since October circulates manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. Балфуром Маунтом and Dr. Bernard Ляпуантом and to indicate their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, health care system of Quebec are not effective, in order to ensure the right to паллиативный care quality before will be allowed to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, - I saw the patient, which has spent 14 days in the ambulance, scary, and no one has taken the necessary steps to their ease.
I am afraid that patients are willing to die only because they did not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Helen Richard have already been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I said my онкологу that I прекращаю treatment, she said, that regrets that I прекращаю struggle - tells it.
At the same time, she said, that my days are numbered.
There is no care all-powerful
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of patients who are asked about death, biomedical, for what they defaulted on their request, after the team on паллиативному care makes their pain.
However, it should be noted that the паллиативный care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to Элси Monroe, director for паллиативному care in the Society of palliative care at home the Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to general anaesthetic in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative седации, in which the patient sleeps till the moment of his death, or from time to time, either.
Can ’ t be more than pretend that we don ’ t know about these suffering.
More and more often, with which it is not possible to relieve pain, can have access to palliative седации.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want I spent there," which means "I want to me was easier."
The creation of this report became possible due to the Handicapped журналистскому research from the Institute of Health Canada.
Motion scandals with the real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system," опутывающей construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
"Industry", which is very costly taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Curiously, as рассыпается this system after were started to work in it all means, jokes Jacques Дюшено, MP and former chief of police Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal as a result of the investigation into the official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the Prime-Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, has agreed a very reluctantly.
"The report Дюшено" has established a direct link between industry, secret financing political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, emphasizes it, one only Ministry of Transport has kept would billion in contracts" if some kept their instincts to take share.
The Commission Charbonneau "for removal of the two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "out of the scheme, behind individuals."
Permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011
In the case of подключилось created in 2011) division to fight corruption, which has an extensive state government auditors, interrogators and analysts.
And, in addition, employees of the special unit "hammer" that after the 2009 forced "сточный cartel" Montreal, stop overpriced contracts.
In recent weeks, was made a series of will, and some municipal officials, in particular of 1000 spectators and Зампино Ришару Маркотту - the Mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gilles Vaillancourt, the late resign as mayor de Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
His suspect in неоднократном receiving bribes when government orders.
In addition, the official indictment was charged with several engineers service of Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Аккурсо and Lino Замбито.
The latter has blown up a bomb, поведав investigations on the "system" of state contracts.
Within a few years, Замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, any посреднику connected with the mafia, which, in turn, translate money Party mayor Жеральда Tremblay "Joint Montreal."
In 2000-x ’ s Замбито сорил money to the right and left, he listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euro) various parties, mostly liberals, who then in power.
In addition, he admitted that illegally collected funds for former Deputy Prime-Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Нормандо.
Sewer contracts, in which the cost of завышали
In Montreal "system" corruption worked aesthetics.
Gilles Сюрпренан, a former engineer civil, described in detail it before: In the ten years he has received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, in matches Ice Hockey Championship and bribes in total on 793 million dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he завышал.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, confessed that were on the leg, завышая account for 30-40% by using false additions.
Then one of the parties, the mayor, Мартан Dumont, accused of on-Tremblay is that he deliberately closed eyes to the existence of a parallel budget, наполнявшего party offices dirty money.
After these revelations of n-Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Руло was one of the first deputies in Montreal, забивших alarm.
The mayor of Ривьер-de-Прэри in the east of the island, she faces with 2010 sales of municipal land, purchased for $5 million and перепроданного... 1.6 million developers at the height of the building boom.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which ultimately will be started, it "for ant ниточку, allowing to understand the functioning of the system, кишащую муравьями to stop гангрену and to identify the perpetrators."
This process it характерезует as "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but Монреалю will need its own group of Inquiry and observer, in order to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we убираемся home.
Regularly.
Jacques Дюшено notices that officials "stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but especially he worried about the role of the "elected officials interpreted this scheme", but not participating in the bonus.
Given that the share of dirty money to finance the election campaign in Quebec to 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, he says, it does not change the situation: "While we will not strictly restrict elected spending, in politics will be dirty money".
It requires a system of public contracts and finance parties: "We cannot move below; boldly вникнув in the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legitimacy."
If this story and casts a shadow over international image of Quebec and Montreal, n-Дюшено calls for those who laughs, to look into its own courtyard.
"ПСЖ - not FC Barcelona!!!!!!!"
This season you in ПСЖ have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained individual сознательностью, but can - and the new measurement ПСЖ.
Profit great players.
Next to them I расту every day.
Technicians also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football, all happening very quickly.
But I am not распаляюсь.
From the beginning, in the centre of the preliminary preparation in the National Investment Fund in Клерфонтене and up to my parish in St-Etienne I always Chagall forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti...
Flea market this summer is not new to play games of the very highest level.
They know that each training is very important.
This leads to the fact that such a player, as I expect to be on the level and contain the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.
His deputy, such as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position, as I am.
Ancelotti is the owner of a position?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect the technical staff.
Today in the First League him not equal, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January, I have with him was обнадеживающая conversation.
Then I moved from a series of injuries.
The trust, which I have also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season ПСЖ?
During the Lyon took away our leader.
But we still-ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We spectacularly квалифицировались in one eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to accept a return match in one eighth final.
Whether ПСЖ to become the first European club in the short term?
He had to do this, already have a budget.
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and position in the long term perspective.
Today, it is not so.
Financially the ПСЖ has the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League last season, will be a failure?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we valid fervently wish to get this чемпионский title.
Last season we were to close.
In May, it was disappointing, because we had everything to come to finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, was even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be in order.
In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title entered such strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to defeat.
Do not think that you can find the media waiting for too much from ПСЖ?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much has gone and what we have players.
We are ready to do so.
On the other hand, when we home win 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what раскритиковать, of course, this is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what to expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We do not FC Barcelona!!!!!!!
We try to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed from time to time.
We have proved in the Champions League that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which already has two seasons are not able to go in one eighth final, although they also spent a huge amount of money!!!!!!!
Given the invested sum, we you were on 15 points ahead of already for the winter Roman-Catholic church.
This would be a dereliction of our opponents and the France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new ПСЖ.
This shows how fascinating First League.
I hope that in May, we can smile and say to myself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
ПСЖ seems to be completely dependent on the feats Златана Ибрагимовича.
And what if they say that there is a "Златанозависимость."
It only means that Ибрагимович very successful and that he забивает many heads.
He came to do this, and it proves that he star First League.
Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star on a global scale.
In a group we his respect as a person and as a player.
He also respects people that surround it.
What he has done, it really is.
It stimulates and other improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have Euro-2012 qualifier against France?
As a disappointment.
I ardently desired to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of the game.
I saw there many things, and I came from there.
Today I can play good Qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped since my baptism in photography.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave command.
What do you think about the first months Didier Дешама led photography?
They for him successful.
He has a good position in the group to the world.
He strict coach, it close with players and inspires for victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he квалифицировал us in the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will photography in Brazil.
Good Honored draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is a basic match?
This match gave us faith in themselves.
Each had fought for all.
Prior to that, the shock in Spain, in my career had no such games.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between receiving sides with commission fees on their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: The belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, изобретенный Satoshi Накамото (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of protocol for the type of BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the one level.
About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as payment.
The course биткойна, reaching a maximum 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before return today about ten dollars (rates are indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the real money exchange or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, has become interested in this system.
He describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "credits" used to promote in a video game, which зарабатываются during the game or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange).
The social network Facebook also has developed a similar system.
But the operation always exchange controls and processes which-or the central authority.
In Биткойн all nodes of the network are at the same time, holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers, and покупателыми sellers.
How is this network?
Each deal between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses, like email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information related to this deal, signed by equipped, using encryption system with a key.
The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to check that биткойны used in a deal, really exist in public had the book, разосланной across the network.
A key step is the registration of new transactions in this book.
It passes through the mathematical tasks, разосланной computers, решивший which, as if a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
It is about the hashing file, i.e. converting a large file in the digital signature, a short and unique.
Computers are "new" transaction and add it to the Room, before "хэшировать" all together.
The aim is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number found, other nodes can easily check that it properly.
Transaction thus turns out to be нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature.
If to deception user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay two times one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed network - and the other would remain unproved, as they have different electronic signatures.
Computer, решивший task, gets 50 биткойнов.
In order to avoid inflation, the regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited 21 million, but they делимы to one стомиллионной that leaves even reserve...
The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computational power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
Sites render services Bitcoin, were assaulted and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.
"Used defect does not apply to the protocol," - assures Pierre Нуаза, which recently launched Paymium - the company осуществляющую payments real money using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB said about possible money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also have this disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog-platform WordPress, their permit.
Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorith Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed Счетную book and found that almost 80% биткойнов not there are in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon enjoys Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which deals with the conversion биткойнов in gold.
Pierre Нуаза, another author of benefits for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or for payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check the transactions, which thus is cheaper.
The owner of better control over your personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install new hardware or software.
It is enough just to address, which can be "photograph and to recognize the phone," explains Pierre Нуаза, not to worry, because he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical system in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin утвердится, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review the various risks, now considered elevated, in the case of the success of this system.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
What ’ s next?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa Province and Суроби).
NATO and the Americans must follow at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose its future, hoping only on us.
From us suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.
And we, with 88 of the murdered soldiers, and ранеными and покалеченными.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commanders, Tutsi refugees fleeing in Pakistan, but also often from the peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Their citizens, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more takes.
The French troops from bases Ниджраб, which I watched from the hills засаженных миндальными trees thanks to French credits, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and combat helicopters have reached in Kabul, without being атакованными.
Since the end of the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their compelling promotion from 1994 to 1996.
While Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood of in-fighting between different groups.
Capture them under the control of the country, as it was a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women paid мракобесие these peasants, in which their surpassed Al-Qaeda, but their situation did not improve and in our days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in подчиненном position.
The main characters anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned to speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge US contracts субподряда.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even do not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not from thieves.
Many young people want to go, as уедут those who managed to American bounty: The outflow of capital substantial.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul, now there are 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs these young people who do not want to return to the old мракобесию parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, TV and Turkish soap opera that is the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment, the army is.
The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, already are taking measures to restore provincial milícias who would not abide by the central government.
Afghanistan, a country with strong local differences, should be to some extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of Prime-Minister of the Constitution, which has existed since 1964.
President Karzai does not want to foreign control, especially before the election, targeted for April 2014.
But his country, starting with the 50-x, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not delivered on their feet, no dam not function, no ирригационная system is not renovated.
All imported; nothing is done, except for fruit and vegetables.
Priority to private initiative.
In a country devastated by war, thirty years of state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral riches.
It has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were there, only to take them.
Without the energy for the processing of iron ore or copper in place, without the means of transportation to their export through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese already almost left field copper months Айнак, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) раскапывать enormous Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers province.
It is necessary to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The French combat units in November 20.
A new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: Lyceum for girls, for boys, faculty of the French language in the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archeological delegation.
Since 2009, to "win the hearts and minds of" and impossible task of combining help with наступательными operations, "applied civil-service activities" at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to the numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain settlements.
These works, with intense attraction of local labor, could help to quell the uprising: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoring forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and an increase in the area of arable land.
We leave the memory about yourself, spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget closed to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
Embassy of received dozens of written requests on the implementation of the small agricultural work, outbound from local communities in the provinces of Kapisa Province.
To get rid of the uprisings, a network of foreign groups that want to farmers, as I said, we need to provide them with a small невоенную support, which would be under the control of the well and would be reported to them directly.
The birth of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt divided more than when-or, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play wa-bank.
See everyone by surprise, he declared on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of the state Assembly has two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text, in which several times has been amended that weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal discord.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, President persists in its "autocratic бреду", "violate the word" and "flout law."
In the camp of his followers believe that is a way to kick the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to Egyptians text, an article in the article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in one interview to the American weekly tin.
The more that the call for short ballot is analogous to the ultimatum the Egyptian people: "Or send your voice for my text, or I leave their extraordinary powers", which, as it must be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals are not accepted the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they хлопнули door, feeling itself is not in a position to give its opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To the necessary кворум was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some very close to Братьям-Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, позабавил the fact that one of the few days disagreements arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee thought that clock Constituent Assembly were incorrectly configured.
The text, which yesterday still went voting, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, Article 2, at the end of the day, is identical to the article of the Constitution of 1971, гласящей that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of rights."
Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" in the "rules" that would give the possibility of their more strict.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" - are liberals who see in this only PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They point in particular to the article 220, which gives the university Al-Азхар advisory role, in particular, that comes to verify compliance with laws incorrect.
According to specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommiers, it is alarming, the people, "to make decisions, not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of the theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, взбудоражены fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be far less moderate than the current.
"At the moment, there is no particular religious intervention.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil rights.
Most of the lawyers, who worked on this text is not Ulemas, and those with a university education, some had been in the French system "- soothes Alexis Блое, which is preparing for the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around the article 220 may be the ambiguity, as used in the terms are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "фикх" [Islamic jurisprudence, 22 ed.].
And in the future may be wondering how civil judges are competent to pass judgment on this. "
In addition to his religious aspect, text, adopted yesterday, is being criticized because it gives wide powers to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Brothers-Muslims argue that they have decreased compared to those which were under the old regime.
Another moot point: The powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, and the National Council of defense.
Nor will be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests associations for the protection of human rights.
Recent also expressed concern about the text, which they believe become subversive for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now is an insult that can have serious consequences for the freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles is no longer says about protecting women, emphasizes Хеба Мораеф, Human Rights Watch said today.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in the article 36.
The word, which does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to last night on television, манифестации scheduled today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

The Oxford hotter, and there are all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet is on 417 m below the level of the ocean.
Coastline in it - brine, easily удерживающий afloat even do not swim.
Landscapes around unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to go through the course of treatment with application of salty water - рапы, and curative mud, and healing in the health services provided and addressing аллергиях, астмах, eczema, degenerative, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring in the damaged nerves.
Touch the secret of an antiquity
Their stores the old part of Tel-Авива - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean.
Through it was the famous Sea, which links Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.

"The Great and mighty" to Moscow over: Migrants копят money on language
So far, and human rights defenders argue that will give the law of compulsory testing or, in a country already appeared fraudsters selling "липовыми" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million guest workers.
For the most part, this is the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money to support families left at home.
Since December 1, entered into force of the law, under which each labor мигрант must be to take an exam on knowledge of Russian language.
As long as this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the sphere of service, житлово-, everyday life and retail trade.
However, over time, - promise in ФМС - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
With will have to be not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to affirm and to get, and to renew permission to work.
An exception is valid only for the citizens of countries where English is an official language.
They elude the law and people, успевшие get certificates and diplomas about education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, обреченность and protection of human rights
A network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language of Pushkin, University of Friendship, MSU, presents and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in Russia for more than 160 such centers.
The initiative for testing and supported Duma deputies, and ФМС.
But human rights defenders before the law went into effect, many times managed to ask the question: What is, actually, will give?
That will change binding knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the visitors?
Above all, - meet representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Very many say now about protecting the rights of migrant workers, the head of Russia ’ s ФМС in Tajikistan Victor Себелев.
The protection of their rights should start to their departure.
Only organized system will allow set by 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise from migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having medical examination.
Without understanding of language, is confident Себелев - the future мигрант condemned face at the expense of the people, which under the guise of helping him всунут "путёвку" in a spooky close in a hostel, where he and dozens of such it will be months when without eating and documents, вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one, and for them to cheat, select the passport, do not pay promised wages," - confirms of labor migration MC Tajikistan Толиб Sharipov.
Not ругайся, насяльника!!!!!!!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, собирающиеся at work in Russia, said that not only do not know the language of a country in which seek to, but also on its own-then write.
Of course, it is not so much their wines, but the point: A few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even are the primary education.
In fact, their families or nothing even to feed their children, let alone to decently their dress, you should put on and equipped in school.
Дорастая before adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity to work.
It is difficult, if not with knowledge of the language, they admit.
"Feel humiliated and incomplete."
However, in terms of the law on the language of human rights defenders note one important moment.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status, there will not be any exam, the official.
Meanwhile, a large part of the guest workers on-still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Посторонним no entrance"
Many of the visitors argue that get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason - in bureaucratic препонах and all those same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is money: From 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here is a false registration can be done quickly and all for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea", - shared with journalists citizen of Tajikistan Умед Хушкадамов.
"Not Налетай скупись, Buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language of it was found out, that sure there are not only мигрантские documents about registration.
A few "lime" certificates of language tests have already removed by ФМС.
Fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they had the new owners are not for nothing: Each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus relieve himself the task of the tests, paid for the seven thousand rubles.
It is in two more times more expensive than the official test: It would cost labour shooting in three thousand.
In the fact that the main task in the nearest time - to protect the system from corruption to "crust" could not be simply buy, converge and representatives of authorities, and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise, not гастарбайтерам person successfully pass the testing of the first time, time to explore the basic language course.
In addition, travellers, do not have knowledge of Russian, will be offered to work in the fields, do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs not takes in the illegal market weapons
The share of crimes using legal weapons back
Of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia offers to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when no victims and slaughter the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Виноградовым, as a result of which Нажать killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing травматики in public places and increasing age, with which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the думского Committee for security and fighting corruption Irina Яровая and promised that the amendments to the law about weapons will components in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "exeedance of nuts."
In the open letter, the authors - representatives of different social divisions - organizations need to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered as a weapon, said the Russian service Bi-bi-si-lawyer криминалист Vasily San.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012 142 crimes committed with firearms, registered in the Ministry of Interior, while all over the same period, there were thousands of 1168.
The authors of an open letter are sure that tighter legislation in the field of civil weapons not puts offenders go to "black" market.
Now, in their words, in Moscow, you can find any weapons are available at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs argue that control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From factories to officers
"Black" market weapons are for several channels.
The main such channels five, tells the Victor Huperzia, ten years who in the structure of the Ministry of Education and генштабе.
A screenshot of the site, accepting orders for weapons
The first is "Army or military footprint", that is, the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapon used to steal and Russian officers, and the old dacha dweller themselves," says Huperzia.
The kind of "black weapons" - stolen criminals from members of the security forces.
Huperzia explains that this includes and Унесенные with police warehouses, and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale with military warehouses.
On many military warehouses often had explosions.
"There is a proven version of that part of the fire were made specifically to himself shortage," says the former military.
Their, in the words of Baranec, make weapons manufacturers.
"Now get divorced private weapons factories, which do not maintain competition in the international market and emit weapons from under-floor on the black market, including Moscow," - an expert.
Another source of "black" market - smuggling.
Especially many comes pistols and assault rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There are its production, sometimes primitive, and was the mafia, which organized the flow of" - explains the former military.
Where weapons?
Experts thought, what is approximate the share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to "black" market.
The report about this in 2011 prepared Center of the problematic analysis and on-line design.
Experts analyzed reporting the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Agriservice, криминологическую literature and open data portals on weapons.
The overwhelming part of illegal weapons, write the researchers, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market has proved to be there "by officials, whose work is connected with weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases weapons comes from places armed conflicts in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of the production of weapons, 5% on the "black archaeology."
The seller-consultant of one of the gun shops, not wishing to call his surname, assures that the weapons, found black копателями, has been no one buys - too старо.
Most often, as he says, for a new party sellers going on a military warehouse.
Over 150 people buying unit, for example pistol holster.
He give it pass through заборчик.
"He is carrying her in the city and it sells to 900 euros per unit with two shops", he tells
"The truth is, the police in the course of all cases, so from time to time when lit a plan to раскрываемости crimes, secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through friends.
I заглядывал on websites, blogs, not yet откликнулся friend, who offered to come on the platform "racing", where will be the person who увезет me in "corner", where we will be an excellent bargain.
The price I learned only there
Military analyst Victor Huperzia
To get the trunk, I need a familiar, which has an exit, tells the seller-consultant. - I so familiar, but I do not believe in it.
Sellers on the markets, but there are also need to come, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to pass, a daughter of a tooth drops out."
I now even a couple of кастетов достаю through the person, in which I am sure.
He, too, their supplies only me, because he knows that I am not сдам.
Newcomers are looking for weapons different ways.
The former military Victor Huperzia has dabbled in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990, when x-groomed to publish an article about this.
The scheme, he says, have not changed.
He gave the album with photos, where it was "anything."
"I feel like in a luxurious shop", recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranec, do not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential client, not just buy - we drive with the seller in the forest, there put target.
"I give an opportunity to shoot, and when I become more convinced that weapons beats a good start bargain", - describes the procedure expert.
The shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet are pulling back on the sites and groups in "tank [ON]", where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
To do this, do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy combat pistol or machine."
Users to leave their applications and asking questions.
But minors can sell?
"Without a license of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling stored).
"Buy ТТ.Москва" - tersely formulates a request "Федоренков."
Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of sites, and people who want to buy martial weapons is rowing by shovel.
People go, as голодная fish on прикормку, and then mined coal in Siberia
Military analyst and former military Victor Huperzia
I have heard about such schemes: Usually site registered beyond the reach of the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer via the ATM produces payment.
"In response, send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," - says the press-secretary of the public organization "right to bear arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Huperzia argues that leaving the form at our website, you can stay without weapons, and get behind bars.
Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of sites, and people who want to buy martial weapons is rowing by shovel.
"People go, as голодная fish on прикормку, and then mined coal in Siberia," he argues.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to meet the amount from 100 up to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Кислова from organization "right to bear arms," Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait for a month and a half-.
He is from warehouses long storage management of these warehouses middle managers.
Under the official стастистике departments, compared with January – October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia fell by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousands, and the number of the revealed evidence of theft and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices by 7.8%.
In the US, an supermarkets and fast food
The box office "Макдоналдс" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days in America, a wave of protests against low salaries in the store of Walmart popular restaurants and fast food chains, such as "Макдоналдс", "Burger King," "Тако Bell", "Уэндис" and "Kentucky фрайд Чикен."
So far, no one is predicting turns this wave in the Ninth Wave or she is in the early stages of выдохнуться.
Stocks have left a number of labor unions and public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that are ordinary workers Walmart and fast food, suggested the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations.
So far, this sector is almost no problems movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after the Republican Day, so called "/ her Dark Friday", when America has fallen оргия cheap распродаж easiest millions of обывателей and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed Port Authority.
To this day, some workers of Walmart, in which all over the world work 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and пикетировали together with the trade unions and the left activists shops corporations, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle ’ s paycheck.
Walmart trades all over the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
So many низкооплачиваемые Walmart workers отовариваются only at work.
Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporate America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods sell-off partly because little pays its workers.
Recent also complain about harsh working conditions, for example, on a lack of diesel or handheld scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "/ her Dark Friday" required to raise salaries and having sex with the fact that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Editor, Walmart employee получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, the consumption of unaffordable, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley Californian argue that if Walmart worked will pay up to $12 per hour, it would cost corporations in 3.2 billion.
This is roughly 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of customers, then each visit to the shop will do them all on 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend on what then-12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of a Walmart note that protests have occurred only in nine states and not corporations nor малейщего damage.
"Black Friday" in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and for this time Walmart sold about 5,000 products in the second.
A total of its cash machines produced in "/ her Dark Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Representative of Dan Фогелман argued in an interview left the Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all-навсего "another пиаровским трюком" организовавшего its trade union.
"Free desk!!!!!!!"
Protests continued this week in New-York, where they were not subject to the department stores Walmart (in this progressive town not favour, and therefore their here as long as there is no), and "Макдоналдсы" and other cheap restaurants.
Макдоналдс says that he sells billions of portions, and after that it does not even gives you the hospital and not pays you for an honest job!!!!!!!
Джумейн Williams, a member of the city council New-York
At the moment the minimum wages, according to federal and нью-йоркскому legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants for the increase, but these are not statistically significant differences, and an average of their ordinary workers receive in New-York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Less them in this expensive city not earns.
How can you be in New-York on such money for me.
When then-through "Макдоналдсы was" almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their always after school, living with parents.
Few saw in that the main source of food or planned linger there for a long time.
Now I constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers "Макдоналдсов" who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children.
On the other hand, on the forum of Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author who notices that irresponsible to get children, if you do not know what you have to feed them.
Participants of the protest, which began at 6.30 on Thursday at the "Макдоналдса" 40-long street and the Madison-Avenue, demanded that кассирам and across fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than have doubled their current minimal earnings.
They also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were created trade union organizations.
The American law forbids the administration to prevent and prosecute activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.
On the other hand, the rarely makes them life.
But to reach a labor union fast food is difficult and objective reasons.
One of the main is unusual.
His
Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day at a rally "Макдоналдса" next to the Times-сквер, which gave a few local politicians-Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council Джумейн Williams, an answer: "Макдоналдс" says that he sells billions of portions, and after that it does not even gives you the hospital and not pays you for an honest job! ".
Demonstrators have supported and other prominent нью-йоркские Democrats, for example, the candidate for the mayor of the city of Bill De Бласио, an answer that "we must we engage in support of fast food, so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every нью-йоркец!".
As has described what happened New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American sphere of fast food.
But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid общепита, in which in New-York busy tens of thousands of people.
While it is unclear whether it will spark a mass movement.
"As long as the fool the brain is middle"
Popular among fans of modern technologies theme added reality lately is seen mostly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer, at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
But out of the conversation with a group leader interactive 3D-technologies in Кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft Шарамом Изади follows, that for this company points - in the past.
Their entices the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
- Tell, please, in general, than in your research group?
- We are human interaction with machines, but try to раздвинуть borders of this interaction.
While mankind in the masses are, in general, stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger.
We would like to look at 5-10 years ahead and foresee any major changes in this interaction.
For example, PlayStations and Xbox Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, in fact all interesting жестовое management.
- What else is waiting for us to come?
- Despite the fact that Kinect endured interaction on the physical level, much still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Input information improved (the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We try to this change, are working on a truly a display systems on the basis of different technologies, including проективных.
You need to release the computer world in our, physical, make it more concrete.
For this purpose, however, need to recognize not only, but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
A popular thing, but not переоценивают whether her?
- it certainly is not a panacea, the question arises privacy, because it is not always want to let others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but in their own niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places we have was the project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over размашистыми, and on being parsimonious, short.
It ’ s not a gestures, and наручным браслетом, who recorded the bones and muscles.
As long as he does great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of wrist watches.
But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice.
- This is how?
- For example, as you ask me to give you this bank газировки?
You say, and at the same time a.
- I usually just say.
- On, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- Does it mean you want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine?
- The first Joe, but not necessarily a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable more accurately determine the reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give it a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensor, which you have claims against the modern holders?
Lack of depth or even what-you?
- In principle, the current generation is, from what we can build our work on трехмерным recognition.
Of course, it is good to 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 to / from.
But it is not the мегапикселях, and as a matrix and depth.
With the last point of view, all the current technologies for us is not good, it adds to the work of designers algorithms.
That is to be remembered not only about the resolution on axes X, Y and Z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The man is a dynamic, and the current 30 to / from the frankly 2000, especially for gestures.
Stephen Бетишес from our Рэдмондской laboratory made сенсор touching with adjustable delay treatment - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not all understand how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be in my work was the equivalent of such a device, but does not require касаний to frames per second was more.
- A number of cameras to increase does not need?
- In Kinect now has three "camera", one of which actually - the IR radiator and the second - receiver reflected signal.
And this is already the third chamber is, actually, the usual сенсор visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras would solve the problem.
Or exacerbate it, increasing the volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create flexible counterpart, Kinect поиграться with camber of cameras and see how it will help in determining 3D.
- Do I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not public provision of their points.
You do not think that from the point of view of everyday use technologies added reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time, разгуливать holding smartphone in of raised hands, not very convenient, but that is what I think: The steep option would be "passing" augmented reality, when on the basis of cloudy platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection screen and then everywhere.
Points is a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you can see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- blanks for a second that manipulation of the virtual голографическими objects in the air is available not only Tony Старку from "Iron Man", but also simple смертному.
There is one problem, which often point critics of such an idea: No tactile feedback!!!!!!!
Hands feel nothing!!!!!!!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
- In their lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh in a breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be additive тактильных sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a substrate for the image.
It registers you!!!!!!!
But there is a technology that is really aimed at giving this "images in the air" осязаемости - for example, atom directed a number of rays at a certain point, where finger, gives the feeling, but it is very weak - as if you blowing on the pillow.
There are also bracelets on the wrist that affect the nervous in detail is also promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
To think that he feels that seems to be should feel at the moment when it is that then-sees?
- Now is a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
Here is another task, over which to fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is on an open, almost infinite - work and concepts jogging (not such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
So far, to lie to the brain, which is still very for many years.
This is what makes the work on a virtual reality so attractive to the explorer is many things is absolutely in its infancy.
Instead of Вкусовщина - Росбалт.ру
"Long" continues to project "vanguard of Saint Petersburg", dedicated to the kings of Poland, which are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
In the top-list already are bright figures art-scene in St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the All-Russia fame.
A new hero "Росбалта" - эпатажный artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller is a bearded man, dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and вернисажах.
Picture Cyril Miller always collect crowds of spectators, where they would not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of a St. Petersburg socially-philosophical сказочников, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a man of the vanguard of the late 80-x - the beginning of 90-х.
In addition, he is a man of the city, to the emergence of the streets calling smile locals, поднимающий all mood.
He recently in the hands of took шарманку and became the шарманщиком as ripe for this difficult role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.
 - Kirill, and why you could still all-around the city in the red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example?
 - I chose red as a designer, and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, имиджмейкером and society.
Although in society all that a little-just not the gray, causes aggression and arousal witnessed properties.
But my provocations aimed at that, in order to begin a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
 - And when you realized that should be an artist?
 - On the DK Nevsky Prospekt, where were entered my work.
I realized that it my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists, and the new, free like me were unclear.
I began to play with the artists new wave, with постгазоневщиной that led to "that-10", and more waves.
I throws in a theater, clothing, music, in all genres, in addition to the speech.
 - And all this joined in your Art-clinic... - I was important очутиться in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where must assemble all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took the for-10, and there, until it was, there was a musically-artistic club, bohemian club, the house at the St. Petersburg.
Many there were born: Номы, Текила-jazz, remember, as string led with the project "ear Van Gogh Museum."
Cord and his friends sang under veneer light songs, they were in обтягивающем Tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor Вдовин.
When the group has meet, she became "Ленинградом."
Trachtenberg was a leading many programs to hale-галивских times.
We gave them Трахтенберга, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing it we have received.
Gallery "D 137," club "Griboyedov - it echoes of the Art-clinic.
There our employees and the habitués are gone.
I hero yesterday, when then-culture that matter.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city."
In the nomination "artist of the year" was named I, while my climax.
In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and the popularity of change, you may be popular, but not very-the cultural.
 - your works is characterized by recognizable manner.
 - Many of my work is hits, bright expressed the urgency and the microscope.
I will be the program exhibition, "The Russian museum in the clowns".
Clowns - timeless category.
I used to social was now be so - it is painful and scary.
But in the clowns all spread, tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have гротесковые ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian baby наказово.
Now face одежке focusing on foreign mechanics, and not on the inner man.
But his hand to be and therefore рожу.
And deception will be removed with the help of play.
 - A recently we have seen you in the role of the urban шарманщика. - Culture city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, not to be.
 - Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
 - Now commercial art should be careful, work, sweet.
Goes disintegration.
People used in сбивались flock, and one loved, простаки more.
Now all crashed on микросообщества, now it is difficult to enjoy everything.
I am not стодолларовая paper to all like.
Now need to think, who will be like.
Now every cult hero to 100 fans.
 - A on Стаса Mykhaylova comes in several thousand!!!!!!!
 - On him come брошенки there сексо-social sphere works.
But on the ground, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand not will come, and in the end less management, money, all languishes.
I have fans, the main thing is they are not deceive, not to spoil the нажитое.
I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector on the wall next to the Фальком and Ларионовым hung.
I started with paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse.
They say: The culture of spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it from another opera.
I am a person culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists, who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of painting.
I for this here is culture.
 - Kirill lacks Moscovsky prospect?
 - good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: Official from the culture.
But not all of them can be culture.
When the right tsars all wrong, kings, can, do not really understand the culture, but they understood that need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow is now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they задвинуты as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same Erarta, but they are what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are artists who must seek to other museums.
 - What is for you - St. Petersburg?
 Petersburg - it is not cultural capital, in Moscow culture, there is much more ground.
And on our stones art grow difficult.
We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it is wrong.
In Europe, a lot of people любопытствующих. which go on exhibitions, concerts.
We have the same this layer to find some rationale.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented in the grant St-Petersburg
To give birth to in space
The Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with an asteroid strike-killer.
Karakul sheep spacecraft with землянами on board to search for the planet.
To save humanity, there is the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact these planets only two that you can develop at least a hypothetical.
"This Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the Astronomical Institute (Штернберга П.К. ГАИШ) Vladimir Сурдин.
But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperature 500 degrees.
Live can only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Even half a century ago, conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations of grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - spacecraft in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies-дрозофил.
In 1979, into space sent eggs перепелок to check, as a developing embryo in weightlessness.
We get to withdraw completely normal them.
But further begins the problem.
"The problem is connected with the fact that this Lorca must find support, he should stand on their legs and start moving" - explains Head of Laboratory of the Institute of медико-biological problems (ИМБП) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladimir Сычев.
Not finding support, chicks randomly кувыркались.
And after 10 hours of the newborns was full atrophy instincts.
Chicks have not responded to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that through four days they just died.
"And two times we вылупляли, then refused to, because it is simply impossible for them to work", stated the failure of the experiment with птенцами in space Vladimir Сычев.
With animals last time biological "миниковчег" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But on биоспутнике "Bion" will only gay individuals.
Was an experiment with rats, which would be sent as space with fruit.
In principle, there is not found opgedeeld.
"It just was on-again биоспутниках, but that is only one experiment, and such research must be carried out," said Vladimir Сычев.
After landing at space rats appeared posterity.
But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, for habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
People, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create подобающий emotional background.
On ethical grounds similar experiments.
But women into space fly for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova ’ s.
And the most precious that humanity is the female body.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on the Earth could not say whether it will continue after the flight into space.
Whether it is to give birth to a child after that.
"Because this question no one answered," says the veteran ракетно-space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June, 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to daughter.
The father of the child Андриян Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut-Svetlana Савицкой, twice побывавшей in orbit and even continued in open space, my son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have little units are astronauts, who after a long flight, and was still growing healthy generation.
"And if more, then this is dangerous, even with orbital flights," - summarizes them-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, the world it is necessary to search for what then-new ways in biotechnologies, protect against radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
NII Гидролаборатория - a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero cells cosmonauts are honed skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, and comfortable, but all-still чуждая Wednesday, then for infants, native.
Small ихтиандры if confirm - life on land of the ocean.
There is a link between what the baby is about 9 months, mother in окоплодной fluids, it is easier to get to the then водичке.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks.
"This is a very little to what-you forget," says instructor грудничкового navigation Marina Aksenov.
In short, if the child born weightlessness more natural state, for women - need gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of a stomach, pelvis, the ability to if the fetus.
Well, okay, опустим and this, relying on stimulants patrimonial activity.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go at birth, вытолкнет it.
"And what?" - sets some non-trivial questions Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, your child is an artificial gravity.
Not that of gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and the muscle system.
A newborn baby in orbit is impossible, as an adult, wrap up in a special enabling costume for training.
It will simply be deprived of what it will be vital.
"And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in чужеродной environment, will lead to the fact that we are a completely дезадаптированного on Earth, a disabled person", - expects to be the head of the Committee on bioethics ИМБП Russian Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space - the theory.
However, after time, this will be a reality, when земляне on their boats will go to distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.
The head of the security check-ревизионного management: Checking Schwartz-system failed to politicians.
In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has a good body control and, despite the presence of high quality legislation, is falling behind in its use.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme security check-ревизионного management, from an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be an ideal, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the", commented on the current situation Kala.
Similar conclusions provides joint inspection Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices have approach Petra Нечаса to so called Schwartz-system.
Recently, Prime-Minister stated that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs audits - leaves is prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be what-either way out, and if it is that then-bans, and prime-minister can not stand up to the work of the institutions, which are expected to check and seek to meet their obligations," stated Kala.
At the meeting of the ревизионного Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between Czech and German parties, within the framework of which it was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What, exactly, was it?
In a parallel testing, which we started perhaps two years ago.
Simply put, the question is about the fact that European legislation asserts, how should go public procurement, the national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with the still unfinished test, were found out interesting differences - in short, legislation, we can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in practice we on some parameters give in Germany.
It follows, therefore, that it is not enough to create more and more with the rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the rule of law.
As well as this project can help you, what it means for you?
It is such a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop specialize pass laws, cutting and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy of means receiving appropriate things for sensible (but not always) low price, to avoid the enrichment and perhaps criminal behavior.
But that is not the fact that we do reach, reducing restriction orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will be to find them much easier than if the restriction does not have decreased.
You talk about internal problems of practical application of the law on State purchases.
But as functions control system in Germany?
Whether there is there such an organization as our KRU (security check-ревизионное management) or it works differently?
As for institutions, there as our KRU is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged in our principle, there is also a panel of working on a little-to another, but mainly both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the authority to some extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is the audit and at the level of federal lands - in this their system of several different from our own.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have a state.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled on the federal level, the Accounting Chamber.
As for the local legislation, there is easier than us?
In general, I would not have wanted to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can take over a sample, but cannot be definitely say that it is better to do everything.
So, because they know it control?
Definitely not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
But we should say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any advantages of cooperation with our office, right?
If to speak about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the Law on State purchases, which then-way are the consequences?
Given that the legal force these amendments rather short, it is not in our work to control.
As we have control over the fact that it is necessary to consider some of the delay.
Take this into account only in the process of training future inspections - we started to use our new tool "risk of detection неэкономности", through which we turned away nearly 14,000 public contracts. We analyzed. There, of course, these changes will be, because the change, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
How do you think, claim that the law will benefit or additional strain on the system bureaucracy?
I think that this law, of course, is a step in the right direction, and, I hope, this подтвердится.
The problem, which can occur, is such that the rules of the "ужесточатся" and they will not be to follow.
When the functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises are related to the supplier (for example, the regional operational programmes - with regional council) that any failure to public procurement law means violation of budgetary discipline.
Whether in this case the enforcement of the law in this way?
I think that is not the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not influencing the decision.
Such a system will only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then, how to get out of this situation?
Let us know that this path will not lead.
Recently, Prime-Minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs audits of so called Schwartz-system. What does it mean?
"Schwartz-system" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be what-either way out, and if it is that then-bans, and prime-minister can not stand up to the authorities, which are expected to check and seek fulfillment of obligations.
You might say: "We are going to change the law and will let it", but one can ’ t say that will pretend, as if nothing happens.
Public procurement law contains very stringent rules, as well as what should formally take place, and this is right. This will protect public procurements.
But, on the other hand, is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only from-for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be an ideal, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough.
Roads in the slippery, but mainly проходимы.
In some places, the Czech Republic and the snowy roads frozen beasts perished.
Mostly they проходимы, but all-where with greater care.

Szymon Орнест: The concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month should be the end of the world?
This all-only one of the many troubling news, on which we, the people, so easily попадаемся.
Together with a group of The STC (STC) we are constantly шутим on this topic and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give an absolutely unique three concerts on the end of the world.
Could you tell us about this readers?
It is about the national fundraising, which we plan for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which is about the end of the Maya calendar, which declared on December 21, 11: 10.
The day before this event, 20-in December, at 21: 00 at the start of the concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will fizzle out, roughly speaking, at the very moment when, on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, the time zone to 12 hours earlier than we have, will end May calendar.
Who came to a head this idea?
Initially it was my idea, we all придумывали together with our artist Гонзой Аугустой.
Apart from the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to together with the public think in this world where we once pass our children.
On the occasion of the end of May, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, could, bags and original ключиков against the end of the world. These things can be bought at the web site www.e-tap.cz and at the same time help us support.
The group The STC (STC) along with other musicians also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "End of the World is cancelled."
Will be already fancied by listeners YouTube anthem on these thousands of concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not.
His запоют all performers in all the concerts at the same time.
Anthems at the same time as the trumpets in the Czech television.
Words to the song has written and played the role of Jesus in video of Tomasz Ganac, participates in the performance also Xindl X...
As you start to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other importance Czech cultural life, because we have a lot of charity events and concerts.
Try to actively to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, they are interesting.
Proceeds from the concert will go on to the end of the world?
For the purchase of the equipment for безбарьерного educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year, we are working with civil association of STC in Едлички.
Teachers regularly attend students of schools Едлички and carry out with them some fun and interesting events.
Students themselves have no money to go to the teachers, and we try to thus provide them with this opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of construction of the additional Едлички in the future there will be separately building, in which we shall move with this project.
At every concert will be a few musical groups and artists.
What were the selection criteria of?
We tried to draw up the program, which will be all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will, Chinaski Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with dan judo player Bartha, The (STC) (STC), Marjan Bangor, Morbihan and Jiří Suchý.
About all the details can be found on the website of www.kpks.cz.
Whether you plan which-or similar "grandiose event" in the future?
In May, will for the first time to speak at the "Prague Spring" and, of course, will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech national house in New-York, and I personally, we will be in the United States, it would act in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group The STC (STC) is a group of people with disabilities.
As you справляетесь with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics??
This is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs., their stroller should travel in the luggage compartment of, plus everything a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
Nevertheless, while inquired as to this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airlines British Airways have always been excellent for us, how many times I stuck.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.
Thanks to выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes to invalids and so on.
With than you were to present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where all the works better than we have, in Russia, we have witnessed what in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow too many barriers, and here is still in wonder independent movement to electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
Also there is not to turn such banal things like to cede the road инвалиду in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there are already there are public organizations that are trying to draw the attention of the people on the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, we are constantly need to catch up to the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the execution of which far behind.
But it is important to specify that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid is that people with severe form of disability to move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, where you want...
There are not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are taking an active part in public life, in which we them with The STC (STC) a little ahead of the!!!!!!!
Respect for public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all indeed begins to change.
As long as this individual cases, people with a strong will.
The group The STC (STC) currently is very popular, but let ’ s get back to two years ago, that in 1998, you forced her to organize?
I entered the Institute of Едлички as tutor, around me was a lot of young people who wanted to than-anything to do.
And since I was a musician and play the saxophone, along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, says our leading Ладя Angelovič, it is a little in-control (laughs).
The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I that then-путаю?
It is true, we helped that we have begun to join the famous stars and actively working on propaganda group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, in fact as if there is no.
Due to the funds of the European Union can we afford qualified teachers, and so on.
Stood there before you is so well unleash The STC (STC)?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do that then-extraordinary.
In the Show-business is full of things, подражающей one another.
This is logical, all new accepted with care, and lasts that long.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that STC (STC) is one of them.
The first impression from a person who we see, of course, pity, it is of course...
But the pity of completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not what then-affected and all abandoned by individuals, which we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities that-then it turns out, this shift, not only for them, but for the whole of society.
Guaranteed if the success of what you strict manager, what you believe many?
If we want to do the job, and we should be in many things hard-line and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe that this is normal.
Some people to us come with romantic representation and fly in the face of the clouds, and aware that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But it happens to any group that wants to work and what-you to achieve.
At present the group The STC (STC) twenty people.
As it was in the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ладя Angelovič.
We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and will power, our door is always open.
He held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday in 20.12.2012 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium, the Incheba in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the heart of Plynojem with the participation of the 12-ti groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities joined телемостом at the moment of execution of STC (STC) "The End of the World is cancelled."
The goal of this project is to collect financial resources in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for educational center at the Institute STUDEO Едлички in Prague.
This ticket on the concert is 400, for children up to 12 years. Free entrance tickets can be purchased in advance in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was a member of the twentieth of the European Space Agency and the country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and over the next years took an active part in a number of projects.
But the path to the space Poland started much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but this is not always were.
Mind you, for example, about the lectures A. Штернфельда, which on 6 December 1933 represented in Warsaw the astronomical observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to космонавтику."
The idea of a young engineer (1905), he left the audience indifferent, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Jan Гадомский was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the award Robert Эсно-Пельтри and Andre Luiz Хирша for "Introduction to космонавтику."
Dr. Jan Гадомский (1899, 1966), which described above, later became a great пропагандистом astronomy and space science.
He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books, dedicated to the scientific disciplines.
Гадомский became known world пропагандистом space science, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway дрезина, missile attack engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking carts should be used rocket.
Information about this дрезине known only from the press.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery began thinking about missile Стрелах.
Research at the department of technology in conjunction with professors Мечиславом Вольфке and Gustav Мокжицким.
Of the remaining materials, you can see that studies reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops works were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press came up with this idea of the photovoltaic missile-fighter, which offered engineer Рогозинский, and next year is the work of "Воздушная rocket-торпеда and aviation rocket-bomb" author Леливы-Кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines.
Before the war all projects of military use of missile technology in Temporary scientifically-Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work of over-for the outbreak of war.
The following scientific work, dedicated to the aerospace, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November issue of the journal "Problems of 1954," in which are published four 3D articles on астронавтике.
In one of them, Professor M. Суботович offered to organize society that will be космонавтикой.
At the time, have already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is an industry.
From the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ПОА) tried to join the international federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of ПОА became its actual member of.
And in the next year, the first chairman of the Kazimierz ПОА Заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became a deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
On this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
From 1956 ПОА brought a significant contribution into the development of the highly successful meteorological missiles RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish, выполнившей scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket, able to overcome the distance 1800 m, was in the length of about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built improved version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on Бледовском пустыре were conducted tests two-stage missiles RM-2.
The rocket was in the length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a state with a real scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring high-rise wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
Continuation of the first missiles such as the RM became rocket Meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
Rocket was conceived as двухступенчатая, its total length was 510), and the initial weight - 95.7 kg.
Has developed three type (defined as Meteor-1A, -1В and -1С) that differentiated the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Meteor missile-1A had a net space of 0.4 l, Meteor-1В - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0,62л.
Maximum range from all three types of was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute took place the development of missiles Meteor-2, and its first flight testing began in October 1970.
Meteor missile-2 with the initial weight 380 kg was able to deduce a cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of the Meteor-2Н and Meteor-3.
Should also mention the entry of Poland in КОСПАР (the Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee КОСПАР two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Interkosmos, Poland participated in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека.
The law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.
It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the value of the labor force (wages) is the price.
Under this concept to be understood, when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition, "" is pushing the cost of a competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their own income.
In mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared to other, high.
Because the private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including produced them unemployment, the inevitable rise state spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of Messrs. entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for social, economic and social damage done them in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that do not need to give specific statistics.
Бесцеремонные methods of private capital create economies at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population with the purpose of attraction in the country of foreign capital.
In other words, governments have their own population to their private capital, despite the social decline.
It reflected the changes in the current legislation.
The goal is economically make their beauty beauty people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment, and at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor laws.
As a result of the increasing poverty, and at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years there is public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves of their own.
The number of these people are already close to one million.
Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur in cases where the employed people get a salary that the state they must register that they were living wage.
This scandal has become known to the public, and in the case of additional employees the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people, under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it did in the 19th-century meters, or exist on salary нищенскую on the margins of society, in the hope that when-first in the country will come the private investment capital.
But bioinformational abilities, from where he will undertake?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or it will not come in general, as well as Chinese, Indian, the Brazilian, Turks, марокканец, an Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of their own, that controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not senior executives of action to intervene in the economy.
Next, you should answer the question is not whether the private capital, is now almost managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
Unambiguous answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost almighty and the omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result we have безысходную situation проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministry of-for lack of funds is assigned to the development of bills private law firms, which tightly linked to the industry.
Then these bills argues Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the western type, but the financially-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious, that liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation the beauty, as described in the Аппианом work "The crisis of Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long breaks up, and authorities are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal getting into with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption have flourished without any bans, and street went on the elections with a previously sold voice "..." decent people not candidates for the position of head of state, in the end once the state for eight months left without Consul "...." seriously began to talk about what the only saving in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for the choice of an energetic person ".. Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy towards autocracy.
As in ancient times, in the modern society is dominated by its own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest.
Private capital is in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
The result is no different from the past: Unparalleled decline or-elite, without any efforts to reform itself deeper.
It means that the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy type can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected next tour.
Above all tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.
The law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level.
Thus, this trend is systemic in nature.
The solution is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the vast part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken a monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory chaos.

The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a lot of responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position by the fact that he has the right to defend itself, but the Palestinians are in the role of the terrorists, other support Palestinians, arguing that racism Israeli state, genocide, perfect over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings is, and who the victim, in the end, today ’ s Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been witnessing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers peek behind the curtain, look at that, first of all, who are already длящееся 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is historical facts, some of them developed on the basis of my own understanding of who or what a group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the story of a power struggle.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently of their action steps, or for their троном who was then-, who has guided their actions to advance the set goals.
Should admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and liabilities arising out of them, the authorities could not happen for the lives of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one that could be seen as head спрута (do not know whether who then-over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschild family.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in 90-x ’ s 19th century to stop rumors linking their name with criminal action in higher areas, in the shadow of which they are, and always have to consolidate their power, financial wealth or both, and to another.
They are the largest shareholdings in nearly all central banks around the world, and against countries, whose central banks do not have their share, they do or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the ouster of Qaddafi was only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has taken the central bank their country in their hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for Ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to produce their own (понимай - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy has started to produce their own money and wanted to cancel the FED (federal reserve system), was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of the economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst world power in the period from 1859 in 1871 has led to the development of the three world wars, created a great Mason 33-level Go Альбертом Пайком.
The task of the first war was the destruction of's monarchical leaders in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial dominance, particularly the United Kingdom, and the third is to reduce the world ’ s population to around 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (within may not be nothing, except as a prerequisite for this project) and final of absolute power.
Method, which has a team of the world ’ s richest families headed by Ротшильдами, is the challenge of crisis and subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos.
But these decisions are sure and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the EDF, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they have managed to untie the war by the assassination of Habsburg heir австро-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, starting большевистскую революциию.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unaccountable in warrior and economically surrender Germany (there was no need to war for the destruction of imperial Russia) and, as a consequence, there was a smashing kingdom-European powers, австро-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleash a World War II bankers and politicians have created a hidden their situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations, than have created a precondition to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then remained only подкинуть Germans strong enough обличающего perpetrators and offering simple solutions Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and indeed played the fifth column, with inciting fire war.
In the end of the 19th-century Go Rothschild family provoked the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Reticular Balfour Declaration of created a prerequisite for mass immigration Jews to Palestine, began to occur the first clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
That during the Second World War, it is difficult to estimate, pulled the Hitler from chains, in which he was initially held bankers, or all of what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created opportunities for the recognition of the Jewish state, the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany was triggered by the military репарациями 2-empirical world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed, to create the war of the third.
If international bankers manage its to untie, Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become a victim of fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, simply speaking, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like the huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but also on the international level (take only a sharp division of people to supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in a strong-Israeli conflict, where the insult generates обиду in endless chain of violence, if it all started with greed individuals and their commitment to a global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers of the Palm off people to vote in the election only their own candidates.
The current Prime-Minister of Israel ’ s Netanyahu Hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ’ s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given control over Iran ’ s Ормузским, containing 20% of all the world ’ s oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), is also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what are now the words spoken by David Рокфеллером in 1994: "All we need to do is the crisis, and people will take a new world order".
A new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, наслаждающейся comfort.
A world where everyone born body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he becomes a under тотальным control.
"And makes all small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand or on the forehead of stigma, so that a person who is not the name of the game, or the number of his name, nor could not buy or sell.
This is the wisdom: Everyone who have the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it corresponds to the name of the human and the number is - six hundred sixty six.
The film "Operation" Argo ": When worse at the Hollywood вызывайте
In November 1979 crowd Islamist students-demonstrators conquered the US embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.
They were supposed to be released in exchange for deposed the Shah Mohammed Reza shrine Pahlavi Khmelnitskiy after the revolution in the US, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration ’ s situation is not meant as a positive outcome - she could not afford to throw out the Shah for board, because it is fundamentally could undermine confidence allies in other countries.
But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution that led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was reinforced with a failed attempt to free the hostages.
Prisoners diplomats were finally released later 444 days, after the talks under the mediation of the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has caused a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment.
Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter ’ s presidential election-year in 1980, completed the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный actor Ben Аффлеком "Operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation by six workers managed to escape.
After a further twists, turns, they finished their way in the embassy of Canada.
The CIA in collaboration with Canadian authorities managed to pick up their from Iran, it has helped extravagant legend cover, according to which they had gone on Canadian паспортам as members of the production team, подыскивавшие in the country place for filming scientifically-fantastic epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood.
To the legend was reliable, journals were on the film, at the press-conference, a fictitious manufacturing company had a real office.
Details about the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film Аффлека is a special blend of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, so called "film-киноопус", the story of a successful, skip the scam is an example can be a series of films about friends Оушена.
In the film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes of the Tehran (Segodnya newspaper reports show significant historical photos of events and how those same situation demonstrated in the film - large differences in this not).
On the other hand, the production Hollywood Emmerich, Venetian with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then still scenes of the Staff-apartments of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discuss the situation in the negotiations on the stairs, on the phone.
Governor Аффлеку wonderful managed to make рестарт career.
From высмеянного actor became respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" Addio, Baby, goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" City "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first film Аффлека, which is not in her hometown of director - Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere of a place at the same time, the qualities that возвышали earlier films directed by over голливудским standard.
And Affleck it is in "Argo", where Tehran "plays Canada."
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when the where-then suddenly changed history.
Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
One had to deal with the fact that it does not imply a variety of exciting scenes кинематографического values.
He is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes that then-додумывает - there it all goes not so elegantly (scene, in which a phone call in America prevents the looming crisis in the airport of Tehran, and the chase on взлетно-strip look quite надуманно).
Lack of "Argo" is рассеянность associated with the need for showing too much events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues really обаятельны, but their characters deserved would be more space, and they are in the film is far from the only.
The film Аффлека lacks a little drama, this film, which you can watch with interest, in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating триллеры seventies.
But exciting.
However, this is enough to reminders about one, still live in a sense of history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated notions about the almighty and всезнающих спецслужбах.
The rules which balloons, bananas and circus
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, performing a survey about the most absurd banking duties, now decided to declare the competition on "the most absurd decision or the project from the EU."
"We made this the last event, in which the EU plans to take 40-interest quota for women in the major European companies," said "Праву" organizer questionnaire Patrick Нагер.
Among the already charges on nomination абсурдностей - the recent decision by the European Court on the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, the women had privileges on life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively are less prone to risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU ’ s people may have to the contest until the end of the year.
The voting will be held before the end of February 2013, "said Нагер.
The controversial resolutions of the EU, for example, and the addition of биокомпонентов in fuel that as a result of the deals damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or about the size of the cells to chickens, which this year has earned their eggs.
Also criticized was a de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное oil" or withdrawal from the sale of the classic lights.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters.
Often the power to adopt a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, which in Brussels usually reserved how-either the state or a group of leaders (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the right of the requirements for their banks).
Interests lobby: For example, bananas higher quality in the EU should reach lengths in 14 cm and not dare to be "аномальную curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission оправдывалась that only harmonizes existing separate national rules, which as complicating its trade.
The EU, despite resistance of some states, all the same toned down standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the directive will lead to расточению products.
Candidate for the win in the survey may be, and last year ’ s decision, according to which sold balloons must be supplied with a warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to the American Research, in accordance with the balloons in the game are a potential cause of childhood death by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years, which is forbidden to blow in ярмарочные дуделки.
Funny ideas are born at home
It is absurd and a rule, with respect to the European officials: Everyone who is in the EU what-or an official position, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name Macedonia, and should instead to "" FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "(" The principle of laissez Faire), proposed to vote, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, the EU is about the size of food reserves in the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic has, for example, installed the canned mushrooms, for which she faced a large fine.
The reports also are interested in and the idea of some countries to pay for what they have, and the idea of providing subsidies to a statement about obtaining subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Will ask the European Union about compensation, "said in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palace (ЧСДП).
As an argument, he pointed out that the country was a high yield of grain, and as a result of the so called интервенционных purchases, the state had full warehouses stockpiles, which had to be taken.
For the Czech Republic is located far from the ports, the EU, according to Паласу, should have to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission has gone to the Czech Republic, the tender for purchasing of grain from countries that have no outlet to the sea.
Subsidies to receive subsidies offered the theater, the Ministry of Regional Development, руководимое minister Paul or German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies should have to go to make statements on subsidies from Brussels.
EU: All orders are the exception
Although the resolution in countries-members can easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies on projects that are not even a hint of what then-general with the deepening of European integration, but which state-members have achieved when discussing budget.
Causes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identity of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and австрийцами have kept the name "Olomoucké syrečky", but "Туземский rum," tradition in our country as far back as the 19th century, our manufacturers should have to rename "Туземак."
Called rum can only products from Brown distillate, instead of sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the famous cheeses "cheese" and "," горгондзола марципаном from German Lübeck, Germany or пармской ham, have proved to be, for example, the Karlovy Vary rusks, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий flavorous delicate hops.
Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of and carrot пардубицкий горжицкие tubes.
People want I оберегал republic, but I like, - says Окамура.
Mr. Senator, as a person comes in the head to run for president?
I do not think about the invitation to become a senator or president.
If at us in the country all function without problems, then I would not be for you.
But I no longer can watch how over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as here суетятся thieves, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when that see-what I do not like it, you try to find a solution, as they change.
And since I was four years old and I am an independent person, not related to what the party, I have no other influencing things but to run for the senator or president.
In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Not поворачиваетесь you in such a way back to the people that you have chosen?
I said that включусь in fight for presidential castle depending on the outcome of the elections in the Senate.
Later I pointed out that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I need to have had the most impact and the broadest powers.
But it is not just that we as a nation ропщем in the bar or the TV, but are willing to trample any who try to that then-change.
Adding to the media that the person очерняют, and which confused freedom of expression with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was adviser Jiří Пароубека.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with тезисами about material and prosecution of politicians and the return of property is responsible for the sum of more than 20 million.
In order to do it, you need to change the law.
You have no powers such as president, and only a senate may propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conducting Excursions became free enterprise, it managed to move.
The problem is политиканстве - when who-that comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately process obstacles, and it contains citizens.
As an independent беспартийного person I have much greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
My advantage in that I without party раскладывания ceasing to, without regard to the tenets of its can take each party that is the best for our country, and apply it.
You are a man, more to the right or to the left?
From the point of view of it seems to me that people are more likely to the left.
For me, not at all important - a little to the left or to the right a bit.
For me, it is important that we went ahead.
It is not that the who-that refers to the right, and who then-on the left, I want to unite people.
I always here any good for society, will offer its КПЧМ or GDP, and I just am against bad ideas.
You злитесь who, when then-says that you populist.
But do not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business-plan for firms, you also have the what-the ideal purpose and views.
And to this you try to come closer.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals, which I say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans.
And with this in politics you long not pride.
Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, then you can realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure away them on their side, so that we have achieved its.
If I was elected president, it was not the problem would be to organize a television broadcast, in which I will appeal to председателям parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to inform, why do not want it.
If it will be a strong personality, which - abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was to pressure from the public.
Speak directly, what I like, not a genius, and not an intellectual.
I try to find allies, to defend the beliefs and views.
I only beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I try to promote themselves; in that case, failing that, after six years of finish and later in the private sector.
This is, in part, it sounds as if Окамура must save the Czech Republic.
I am not savior.
I know that one I don ’ t make, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to stand in the Senate.
I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused to in connection with a large amount of work.
Also I at least supported leading investigation journalist Jan Лоренцову, which exposed fraud with light fuel oil prodicts.
I put forward his candidacy because people did elsewhere, but now I feel themselves on traditional.
Sixty per cent of people do not have gone on the elections, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment.
Independent of us in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be carried out.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections for mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of own party?
About it I have not thought, because I have no time to check the past each potential workers, and I have no money on this.
There is no money, and in the presidential election campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You have no money?
You talk about property proclamations, and how are your own business with this?
Personal wealth estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague, worth approximately $25 million, the apartment on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, art collection of roughly 10 million, Aston-Martin on the 3.5 million and Skoda plant, in a million, and even a few million on the account.
By the way Aston-Martin I have appeared, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked the Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women and, at the same time, fought against the villainy and lawlessness.
You on Aston-Martinet, own property on 60 million and you have no money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money and do not want to invest in it.
This is not very convincingly.
I have no 15-ti million on the campaign.
I must inject themselves into debt?
In a campaign I already has invested $2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not as interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on campaign I in fact will cover сенаторская salary.
But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay son for English school, which is 30 thousand monthly.
If I wanted only to earn money, so you would not stated.
Thus, you will be engaged in business, to live?
Do not you said that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, its activity I partly reduced.
For example, managing director of spring will be my deputy.
People would like to that I was бессребренником, which will keep the republic.
But I also need to then-live.
But, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to receive monthly?
From 200 to 400 thousand that get further.
And if I became president, then their business would be finished.
The full interview you will find in субботнем press release of the "right".
Architects MVRDV argue that these adventures are not only in the popular imagination - for example Spijkenisse and his newly built event mountains - 2 photos
"It seems to me this is a fun, it looks футуристично, finally-then we have again, you can see that the then-interesting," says Лизетте Верхайг, прохожая at the edge of the road.
And Stephen Спермон, an expert on IT on located in the vicinity of large enterprise, thinks so: "No, this is a really beautiful."
But I ask themselves: Why today we another library?
All have the Internet, the iPad and electronic books.
Now no one voluntarily does not go in such voice-only library, right?
Spijkenisse, малопримечательному спальному geese under Роттердамом, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80.000 person has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this frustrating: A few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes, in the form of a picturesquely multicoloured miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they remained the only opportunity to statistics: Build a library!
Вини Maas from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, the bold stacked diagrams and author of ingenious, sometimes even cynical buildings, the task with his usual невозмутимостью and appeared in the contest Demo listening in 2003 with five books under the mouse and ухмылкой on the face.
And as long as the members of the jury озадаченно looked and shrugged shoulders, taken Maas has combined from its original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of the project the following words: "Dear citizens!!!!!!!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Spijkenisse, so called Букенберг!!!!!!!
Nine years later, the cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjoint residential houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, "the book" was awarded with the prize of the competition "Best library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch the wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, безликий suburb, which could not offer nothing but post-modern pedestrian zones and surprisingly некрасивой town hall, white facades that suggest about молокозаводе, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But the most important thing - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to book
First impression: The collective of the Boy in the Plastic Bubble for cheese.
Here only one elevator, taking place in the heart of the, in fact true fans of architecture and reading prefer to explore the area on foot.
Остекленное from all sides - bright and easily foreseeable, floors from обожженного bricks and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban area.
Urban environment is revived.
View unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually book shelves are along the facades, and is located in the middle of a dark room, as a rule and неуютный безликий," says вини Maas.
We put the classical configuration space from legs on a head and pulled zone for reading from the inside out.
An internal space book mountains used skillfully: In the center are offices, Internet-library, chess club, Environmental Centre and technical facilities.
Especially with black book shelves, which serve the workmanship of the walls, then парапетами, then very railings.
Their views, texture and the smell of unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers-builders are lost in effect, what it is for unknown material.
"We have sought to work with secondary materials," explains Joop Трауборст, manager of the project, a community of Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And as the-times on the same agrarian company in Friesland we have met the right a byproduct of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as lining under roots used artificial волокнистый material thick thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serves as a one-two of the season, then you can emit.
For the library is a canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was спрессовано in the thickness of the four this year.
Under the action of heat and pressure so called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material to smell a little like a new car and a bit of running shoes.
At the top are 105 footsteps.
The one who wins over a length of almost 500 metres, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and its фикусами in.
They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place on the correct humidity on literary mountain.
The costs of a new soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents the ideal project in terms of the environment," says Троуборст.
For its heating and cooling uses of the land.
Although the book is the Bell Jar, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Wide farms from laminated wood, located across, give a shadow and take up most of the sun.
The climate in the room are very nice.
The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Спермон, was featured above скептик from IT, have already visited the new library.
Лизетте Верхайг also was already here.
As well as преподавательница traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which called Букенберг "soul Spijkenisse, which have long been missing."
The reason: For a few weeks before the opening each inhabitant of received an invitation to donate one book from its own collection.
These books should take the blank space on the shelves have not yet fully equipped libraries - at the time it was 70.000 books.
The idea of work.
Shelves заставлены with.
"There is nothing worse than полупустая library", says the architect вини Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now each inhabitant of some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional slang called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And if they are very young and uneducated.
It is only the starting point for building identity.
Szabo: "The Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabó, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of Palestinians to obtaining observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence is not speaking too critical toward Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a prohibited area for flights.
In the end, NATO conducted this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is true.
The point is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, led by the US, to actually German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans is not a single coherent policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
From them that they will be expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I believe that as long as they only sounds its role, but are on the way to more "normal" foreign policy.
Such foreign policy, which is France or Britain.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to take in its national interest, not one dependent on the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other major countries, and that is why Germany must defend its interests.
Whether these were affected by economic interests in position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?
In-first, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
So it must be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not attached to too little, it is not completely biased.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, aimed at making important decisions, such as a vote of Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the US ’ s understanding of the German position.
So I do not think that this was the same dramatic надлом, as in Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany even will thus a certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be seen as a serious player in the international arena and that with its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly have voiced support for a veto.
There is the differences of opinion between the United States and many European states?
In America ’ s domestic policy such differences exist.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, can not openly to hold such a position.
I believe that significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime-minister of Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not the policy of Netanyahu.
Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, непротиворечивая European policy, but now it is not.
So they cannot act as part of a broader approach and forced to instead to act, relying only on their own vision.
It was so they come with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that Germany is not easy, even from for-ties with Israel.
This theme has always been щекотливой.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an international player is not will take it on themselves really a central role?
Or a leading role still difficult given Germany?
Germany has not got used to this, it still has always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, is always difficult is to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assume an important role, are the most various антигерманские feelings.
Germans do not just deal with it.
Actually, it is an old problem: You do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is considerably more than the plight of the than the US.
It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European politics is faltering, but at the moment the EU does not fills this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, unpleasant or reinforces нелюбовь to you - this is life!!!!!!!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is the Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered in China ’ s name, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it was established.
However it will be protected until the owners of source names not with the suit.
But then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners all the harder it becomes to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Паттлох, lawyer company Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights on trademarks in the Far East.
On my desktop every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Add enough Имитаторам just a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada can be registered Prada-Kny.
The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Паттлох opens the folder with records of the state registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered in the trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which used the name fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
What the Chinese - champions of the world on copied and violation of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities have a multilevel department stores selling almost exclusively forgery.
But Паттлоха. Such is not the case on behalf of their clients he opposes to Chinese company is officially received from the state registration marks the right to use the name, which already is where the then-still.
The Chinese call this "ban" минпай, brand-passenger.
This word is associated with "ban дакуань."
So called women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not accept the blame
"It damages the business, with this it is necessary to fight", is convinced Паттлох.
"Trade mark размывается, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering".
Financial losses and procedural costs alone millions in the affected areas, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products.
According to the company by market research CLSA, China, with estimated sales of $15 billion euros a year is the third largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods.
But to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Паттлох tells about affairs, in which the court rejected claims, as after a long time опротестованное name has become "реалией market."
If NOT not lucky, he even will have to pay плагиатору, as did the damage his trade a in China, says Паттлох.
Sometimes it is ruled by the Law of the Jungle.
There is also famous for graphic elements.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with producer of construction machinery SANY, enterprise, which not long before the company acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister Goker.
That is why the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star Mercedes.
Volvo Купившая company line originally used Сине-white logo, напоминавший BMW; process was a success, the line had to change it.
Producer of fashionable goods Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registered trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010 from-for lack of personnel and equipment rooms there took place.
But in the past year the return of "from an emergency situation in the working process to normalcy."
So, the number of unprocessed affairs on objections has dropped by 22 per cent.
It was closed almost projects such cases, 75 percent more, than in the last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the Department.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year in CTMO received more than 1.4 million statements about the protection of trademarks, almost a third of the more than in 2010.
This record, and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to authorities.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, just 5.5 million units.
In 2011, has been paid 1.8 billion yuan.
If to simplify, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Its appeal is many times more, as the case of the German family enterprises of the plant.
For more than seven years, the group is struggling against the Chinese плагиатора.
The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal manufacture them fake automobile parts elimination.
However, the simulator for a Chinese rights to the trademark plant.
It was their own omission, as a surname in Germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno Вентцлер, Chairman of the Board of Chemical plant be in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks CTMO отклонило claim мюнхенцев.
However, in both instances the plant won, but other party continues to fight so far.
Need to be vigilant
Now the question is being reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Вентцлер hopes to bring it up to a good end and commends the professionalism of ships.
But he also said: "The process is extremely expensive, and we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic spending is unlikely to be archive, accounting firms had to view even acts of a century ago to lead the evidence.
Five years ago, to no avail plant proposed a counterparty an "greater шестизначную amount in the euro" for settlement.
"From here, it is clear how costly it is to us," says Вентцлер.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even in Europe.
And if imitation of зарегистрируют there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register a name for a plant footwear and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration.
"Need to be vigilant," says Вентцлер.
As he and lawyer Паттлох recommend German companies be very cautious about China.
It is not enough to rely on international guidelines on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be "all that what-either way is worth defending, to register also in China," says Вентцлер.
Otherwise it may prove to be worth far more than the registration.
Indeed, if the plant to lose in the last act of his drama about a sign, you will have to pay a counterparty an license fees for its own name, explains Вентцлер.
Otherwise we will starve from the market in the unsettled segment.
The World AIDS Day: Притоптывать, to sing, to help
In Хайдельберге is rehearsing the choir Имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphan rejoice.
The history of relations who overcome a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First heard stomping: Cowboy boot, basketball sneakers, дамские лодочки and male тапки паркетном tact, pick up on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that slowly voices are singers - a viola, a bass, Brahm and soprano - they come, enchant and follow each other.
And Фите Hopf, 29-summer conductor, just not this their extraction of shoes, when leads their flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the institute of medical psychology in Хайдельберге choir Имбонги is rehearsing a new song.
On репетицию came 50 members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old, from специалистки on human genetics to porter.
"Om" Обани "is not an easy thing, each voice choir has its text, in addition to чуждом language: Зулусском, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of the Swaziland.
Help others to help themselves
According to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS in the world, there are about 34 million HIV-infected.
A 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245 000 orphans of AIDS.
With more than 40 percent of the population of HIV-положительны.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Эситжени Voices for Africa was step in Germany.
70 of them attend school, готовящую to further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in health-centre.
On Имбонги зулусском language means narrator or восхвалитель.
In this hall do not speak fluently on банту, but can sing.
Almost ten years choir разучивает song on this another soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers far from 325 Heidelberga, on the Great North-west kingdom of Swaziland is village Эситжени, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Infected forty percent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple stick huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who have died from the virus ИЧ.
In Эситжени in miniature reflected the disease only Swaziland: The highest level of HIV-infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection in half, among the population is almost not accepted.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ’ s population is in itself to AIDS death in the middle of the fourth a dozen is not uncommon.
The choir has opened this village in a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the Имбогни saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but also just total: Food, clothing, education.
Without school education in a poor country have no chance.
At first it was a commitment of individual participants - a few euros a year to send children to school and to allow him to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later, the choir founded association "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professionally cares for AIDS in сиротах Эситжени.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The STI бактериальным, syphilis, chlamydia and триппер (гонорею).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, the human папиллома-, genital herpes virus and hepatitis.
Лобковый педикулез and чесотка refer to паразитарным STIs.
What are the main поражаемые group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
Institute of Robert Koch comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.
The heterosexual adults common point of sexually transmitted diseases, are хламидийные infection, трихомониаз, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among young people хламидийные infections occur significantly more often than other groups.
European data, three quarters of all infections with young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people is also often meets human папиллома-virus.
As the changes, the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The prevalence of affected by a syphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007.
In 2011, was about 2,700 cases.
It is about one tenth of one less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of indicate had venereal disease?
When infectious diseases can occur ulcers in the field of the genitals, complaints when мочеиспускании, selection, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by mother and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How do I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide full protection.
As part of the setting, sexually transmitted diseases can spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
However, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.
With early diagnosis can be cured the majority of STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least royalties for the choir across Germany allow all-that collect.
"We have sent in Эситжени already about 200,000 euros," says Аннете Леннартц, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manages Цодва Dlamini, the conscious and active woman.
She also cares for to orphans were well set up, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Гогос, as they are known in зулусском old women, this reliance village.
Some of them have taken to itself to 14 orphans, give them shelter and care to children in the form of every day to appear on the lessons.
Those who did not go home, in a shelter to Ханийсиле, lonely woman, the salary of the association, as well as two поварихи that every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" organized швейную school, has built two курятника and, in conjunction with the American to PSI arranged surrender analysis for HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease that is so evident throughout the country, deeply prefer to keep silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Аннете Леннартц - "because it is associated with sexuality."
Quite unusual for the country in which King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of reformers.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the state санкционированном style of life is also responsible for the fact that the virus ИЧ so quickly spread in recent years.
But it is also on stray workers who разносят virus across the country.
Free condoms is literally on every street corner, says Аннете Леннартц, "but their almost do not use.
Another culture - flesh to flesh ".
To a little to support cultural exchange, the choir Ибмогни every two-three years is a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of black continent know since the days of apartheid.
A bus full of whites, who sing songs on black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened, evoked tears to the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip is always results in Эситжени, where singers are raising children.
Despite the fact that a small village with labor can be found on a map in the valley of the river Эцулвени it more than known.
"Go in there, Эситжени light", say locals.
And after 8733-km flight back in Heidelberg, when топающие singers return to репетиционный Бергхаймер hall on the street, you can see that this light burns also here.
Messenger: NASA opens up ice on Меркурии
"The Messenger" found evidence that on the planet Mercury there is ice.
Ice coverage may have thickness up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as you can see from the three research, published on Thursday in the journal Science.
"The Messenger" found evidence that constantly located in the shadow of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes with a comet or asteroid, freewheeling обещает.
No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature can reach Меркурии 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other construction elements of life in other places of the solar system.
Unnoticed for the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example "Phoenix", explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send to the Earth images: Small windows in endless gave.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute for.
Eight planets of the solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the Sun for famous Neptune Fountain - Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet".
This piece of infrared telescope image "Spitzer" is "a family portrait" countless generations of stars: The old star in the form of blue points, is more difficult to identify in a star of pink "common" star.
This region звездообразования - scientists неромантично called his W5 - opened discovered by "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6500 light years.

This new star in all beauty managed to photograph only using infrared sensors "Spitzer telescope."
Saturn and its rings: How they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is that the moon of Saturn, which really disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the great and the most clear shots "Hubble telescope": Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies turn in these works of art.
Published European South обсерваторией picture shows the remote for a few thousand light years Трифид Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word Трифид trifidus (трехдольный, трехраздельный), as well as the dark bands dust is divided into three parts раскаленное heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus astronomers photographed a harbinger of space collision: At a distance of 400 million light years from Earth to the kernel of the two galaxies which meet комікси towards each other and inevitably collide.
This is the birth of stars telescope "Hubble Space Telescope" took off in a spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical cuts may call it the nickname "Southern Цевочное wheel."
Photography space telescope Hubble Space Telescope "" shows a fragment of the astronaut iris in the constellation Cepheus.
Nebula, remote at 1,400 light years, consists of dust particles, which from ten to a hundred times less than that of conventional home dust.
This image was drawn up from optical and of various telescopes.
It shows the ring of black holes, remote to 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP these took off for NASA Hubble Space Telescope "."
Greater спиральную galaxy scientists call graduate 1810.
In this stellar astronaut is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
From the cradle constantly creates new star.
This star cloud, in accord with the illustration Rosette, also constantly creates new star - at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright fluorescent galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it was not long before the Big Bang, when the universe is basically like hydrogen.
Our views in the Universe: The most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Липперсгеем - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes became more and more - and included their cultural space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, telescope "cases" in the Palomar knot under San-Diego was discovered by one of the largest in the world.
Mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the "Binocular Telescope."
It allows to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
"Gran Телескопио Канариас" has a giant internal device is only one diameter mirror is 10.4 meters.
The "Big South African telescope" in South Africa сегментировано - for the sake of the decline in value.
However in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of an inexpensive for: Telescope strictly under seal vertical angle - it restricts his mobility.
Telescope "Хобби-Эберли" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: The high светособирающая ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world ’ s largest telescopes.
With the help of the radio in Arecibo, Puerto-Rico) researchers listening out of terrestrial signals in space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project "Search внеземного mind" (Seti), the owner of the computer can help by providing its computational power.
Views of the European обсерваторию astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is "Very Large Telescope" is entirely appropriate to his name.
His four mirrors to cover in the visual tube even the average infrared spectrum.
In Chile ’ s major Observatory ESO also planned to install the European "Very large telescope."
His main mirror should раскинуться on as much as 42 meters - and will be drawn up of nearly 1,000 MNS elements.
However, photos can be expected not before 2018.
Until 2007, both telescope "Kek" on the volcano гавайском Мауна Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They installed two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "Kek" in Мауна-Kea Observatory, which along with them looks in the sky is also using telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF.
In addition, the Мауна-Kea should have new giant telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
But the most important views from space supplies "Hubble Space Telescope."
On April 24, 1990, he delivers the distant worlds.
Since March 2009 space telescope Kepler "" looking for planets outside the solar system - above all such, on which it is possible.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that planets 1235-candidates was discovered since the beginning of the mission.
On the photo depicted the preparations "Kepler space telescope."
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not previously 2018 on board "Ariane 5 rockets."
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for the explosion.
Scientists suggest that on the south pole of the Mercury there is ice.
But reliable data about this, "Messenger" revolves closer to the Pole.
Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the Меркурии there is ice.
Thanks to запущенному in 2004 зонду "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists now believe.
Drink oil every day - and живите to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan many residents are on-библейски respectable age.
Even here there is a Museum of longevity.
The search for разгадки in a country where 97-summer Old Men Gathering Together seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan many residents are on-библейски respectable age.
Even here there is a Museum of longevity.
The search for разгадки in a country where 97-summer Old Men Gathering Together seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called the wild and romantic.
Minibus with громыханием rolls on the winding road past it dense forests hills, turbulent rivers and the simple peasant houses.
All around the green and bright, that it is possible to think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the most southern municipality of Azerbaijan, Iran ’ s border is only a few kilometres away.
Here live талыши is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is a little bit, only that they speak Farsi and азербайжданском and different longevity.
The final point is Lerik, Azerbaijan.
The small town of кичится too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is not in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost did not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too утомительна.
At 323 kilometer takes eight hours, as the road has only one.
Legendary wealth, which the oil from the Caspian Sea, here, in a province until добралось.
But Пилата Фатулаева (48) convinced that in Лерике than there is of interest to tourists.
"In May, Baku has become famous for festival Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will be the oldest person in the world," says Фатулаева.
It is the director of the Museum of longevity is probably the only in the world.
Here задокументирована biography about eight dozen талышей from these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева indicates the black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
In the age of 136 years he was born another child
But disputed the star of the museum is чабан Ширали Мюслюмов, which allegedly turned 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not.
And given that the architecture of the person, whose age confirmed documents, was 122 years, age Мюслюмова is extremely dubious.
"He was born in the area as a result, who died in 1973," explains Фатулаева.
A man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born the daughter.
So whether чабан Мюслюмов added a couple of decades to its age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute for in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.
"It is striking a lot of people of old age can be found in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the valley Хунза in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia also lives are a lot of very old people."
But from-for lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no civil registries.
Every day a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Лерика shockingly often reach biblical age.
Now here are 20 people over 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so many centenarians?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Мугимзаде explains this special genes талышей.
Director of the Museum Фатулаева, on the other hand, believes that the food.
Talysh people like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them on выпивают стакану baked oil every day. But it is unlikely that such высококалорийная diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view.
Or the первобытном lifestyle that keeps people youth? In Ченгемиране, tiny village near the town of Lerik, Azerbaijan, lives Рубаба Мирзоева.
In 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes.
Мирзаева, which argues that it has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the main problems of the region.
She sits on the floor with wishing oils, which tirelessly катает there-here.
Here, under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Мирзаевой, which for a long time already there are their grandchildren.
Also nearby gallop two kids.
In the kitchen guests prepare tea is served in the typical пузатых армуду glasses.
The Мирзаевой perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, under the платком it hides a long dark-blond one, which her son proudly opens in front of us.
I always my hair milk, so that they never would not slip and saved the color.
"And I never shampoo," says Мирзаева.
Monthly pensions for life
She always eaten only that has grown in the yard, tomatoes, potatoes, polka dots.
For all the life I never bought products in the shop.
Then she tells about his return, served in the army.
Heavier than there were after the Second World War.
But it was better, when "favorite" father Heydar Aliyev was at the helm.
Propaganda is not frequently in the speeches of the old woman.
However, the cult of created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no limits.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the reins of power to his son Ilham.
Yet among Azerbaijani vassals there is poverty.
230 (roughly the same the same amount of euros) Мирзаева receives a monthly as pensions, for local conditions of this amount, in which you live.
And, perhaps, for a long time the similarity of the son of Мирзаевой too right: "Old men in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a big family, famous, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not the reason to stay alive as possible
The word "human right" is absent in the constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo suggest deep расколе country.
The future constitution based support for Shari'ah, met furious repulse.
Egyptian President not скупился on pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech is turned to all people, but first and foremost to the Christian коптам, liberals, of enlightened Muslims and has been practiced for non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly group in растерянной opposition, have fear.
Fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of powerful "Brothers-Muslims."
Mohammed Morsi, if not rather, has said that he is both the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-summer engineer with the degree of Doctor of the American University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Whether deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles managed to протащить 15 in the night-time jump steeplechase on исламистски настроенном constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and this is partly raises fears.
As in previous truest in the project, said that the procedure is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But that means "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and in connection with her legal люфт for more strict interpretations of Sharia.
At the very least, this one hints нововведенная article: In all matters concerning the Sharia, it is necessary to attract for University of Al-Achard, an Islamist institution in the country, a great authority in Sunni Islam.
It should not, but it can mean that clergy regulates the laws that de-facto would be the consequence of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: Should survive jurisdiction civilians military trial.
These courts in the period of power Mubarak served to suppress opposition.
After the ouster of dictator in military detention will be to civilians.
Also, as explained in the project, the state must safeguard "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is set forth as нечетко that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of the film and literature.
Text is not that other, as censorship.
In general, nor one article does not install right equality for men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But what is insulting and how it is punishable by, remains unclear.
Questionable also seems formulation that prohibited "insulting people."
Will be enough cartoons of the President or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Morsi has a signature and which, he says, "very soon" will be presented to Egyptians to a referendum.
"Revolution" is back
For several weeks is the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people have gathered in the unusual consensus on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to eradicate this document before he will be able to enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will be victorious," said Хамдин Саббахи, the player that won third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Mohammed El-Барадеи said that the draft constitution place "to dump history."
After a short news Twitter he accused Morsi supporters in a desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he were to declare a referendum, we shall go to his palace and its скинем", - said the opposition member national, Yasser said.
"We have not tired, the blood of our brothers have not отмщена", - quoted Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that do not want to observe the referendum that would make his invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well organized "Brothers-Muslims", in turn, called for the opposite demonstrations, but, from the precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after mass prayers on the other bank of the Nile in Cairo University.
Participated in a large number of women under the covers and adherents of Salafi who shouted: "People божьего requires application of the law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Очисти country!" And assured: "The Koran - our constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square, where it all started, unleashed the almost civil war.
Followers of Morsi, quite clearly, did not want to go to this risk.
"Brothers-Muslims" announced that, as opponents and supporters of the draft constitution with loud and clear.
Now it is time to give the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction to go to the country.
The majority of the Islamists, it is considered to be resolved.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned never"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in fury from this форсированного constitutional process, which, at then-, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
48-summer lawyer for Human Rights and the chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (ЕОПР) defended "Brothers-Muslims", when under Mubarak, they sat in prison or appeared before the court.
Not because it divided their worldview, but because of human rights for him неделимы.
For this he was beaten, condemned, was arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, regrets it in an interview with the Welt "window".
Morsi ’ s expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state frustrating lawyer.
These measures are an obvious strikes by the democratic rules of the game and will of Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of to strengthen civil state, president of the de-facto annulled his", - regrets Sayeda.
After all, without civil organizations democracy can not function.
Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
For this may be retaliation.
Демонстрант in Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster, which will not be able to control".
Norwegian ракфиск: The most misused odourless fish in the world?
The пятимиллионного population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but also in the rest of the world.
Perhaps the success of the country ’ s then-linked to local addiction to one extremely зловонному fish dish?
Take a few перезревших blocks of cheese.
Place them in a bunch of dirty and потной sportswear.
Leave them on after.
You could отшибающий sense of smell ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, in three hours ’ drive from Oslo.
Around the picturesque view. It is very beautiful, but in the air разлит неистребимый characteristic smell.
Ракфиск is trout, посыпанная salt and бродившая in water up to a year, depending on what exactly душка need to achieve.
As thicken and dusk холодает, crowds gather at the Norwegian Festival in Фагернесе, dedicated to this most of, say, the fascinating dish.
"It is eaten raw and are served with strong alcoholic a glass of akvavit, local тминной vodka," explains Хавард Хальварсен, local fire by profession and a ракфисковый "General", which manages the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat threaded small cubes fish and its we meals are served with strong alcoholic spirits.
"Who then-like more than Аквавит ракфиск," says Хавард.
This drink is capable of перебить smell.
I пробую a couple of pieces.
If you could carry a piece of the right under our noses, things are not so bad - differs little from sushi to you for a long time was with him in the bus.
Ракфиск is a Norwegian product from a completely other times, the poverty, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish in the autumn of замачивали in blind closed barrels with salt water.
Then a deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly забродила, its извлекали and приглушив perception of alcohol, use in food.
Even on the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norway were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is rapidly growing - more than 13% of which are immigrants who come here jobs, higher wages and developed social welfare system.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, but not so long ago and far more Dostoevsky neighbor) massively come here to work.
Ракфиск is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, though a few зловонный element of the past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here all expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich filling a backdrop of you at 9 pounds sterling ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world ’ s news, and most of the inhabitants of the country that seems to be.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik ’ s, and расиста экстремиста right, in the past year расстрелявшего and killing 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, bombing called "what happened on July 22,".
Норвежцам very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens turned out to be able to such atrocities and killings.
At the core of today ’ s prosperity Norway is growth (since the beginning of the seventies), one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, разносящая trays with elegant ракфиском, a woman with long white hair and striking blue eyes, the epitome of нордического prosperity.
We the people - as you call it - рассудительный.
Like most of the sport, it is perfectly says on-English.
We do not love has confirmed exhibiting at the show, we are not хвастливы.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil - most of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund, created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to a financial crisis, when all сорили money, which they did not, Norway is economical подсчитывала all costs.
"As long as you can go skiing in the winter and walk in hiking in the summer, this is enough to happiness," says Anna.
"And there are ракфиск," she adds with a carefree laughter.
I stand in snow in the queue for any first-food - ракфиска enough.
Here is a burger with лосиным meat is certainly the exotica, be tasty meat.
But in the evening, we are even greater number of all the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel are a special dinner dedicated to ракфиск, in which visitors ballot determine the best or, perhaps, the most you fish.
There is a direct телеэфир, in which show a leading in tie-butterfly, surrounded by plates with ракфиском.
It seems like a song contest "Eurovision".
"So, Tor-Jürgen what you put the assessment for Best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Хавард, here is our estimate of...."
All laugh and applaud.
Who then-falls from a chair, perhaps, factually akvavit.
And maybe just надышавшись smell this fish.
Mexico ’ s president, Enrique Peña Nieto will be difficult start career.
So far, the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join the post, the BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at, with whom he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of his country.
Road traffic in Mexico City in especially pickle.
This city is overloaded, transport and in the best of times, and Monday were erected steel wall, перерезавшие several key highways to the capital, and behind the chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to not give people access to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests to get to the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of the Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto наденет presidential перевязь and take the reigns of the country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has good economic performance during the Felipe Calderón, which now stacks of their powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years already took about 60,000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico about their readiness to deal with violence", - said earlier this week, n-Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in round the office of the White House.
I am going to offer a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
To such statements next to the US president ’ s political career, on-Peña Nieto has developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
At his home, in a vast and densely populated state, the surrounding the capital, opinions about the new руководителе are divided.
A man was
In an idyllic town Валье-de-Bravo, for example, about him remember with warmth.
Residents put him with taking the tourism, the development of the spa area and the creation of infrastructure.
You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built-in, Peña Nieto, who are fundamentally different from the roads with выбоинами and holes, which were previously on this site.
A placard with his name on the modern building sports centre and an interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We have come to associate with it hopes for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Congressman from state led by Peña Nieto институционно-Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect the present and drastic change, which is so badly needed our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was supplanted by in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12 summer in the presidential palace Los-Пинос Party has great expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he disproves charges that бессодержательности, introduced a new president of the opposition.
It is very прямолинеен and is buried in the realization of their vision for the future of the country.
A great statesman, and, above all, the person who knows how to listen to.
But in other parts of the state, many people have a different view of the former губернаторе.
The municipality of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad-Неса, is the most difficult contrast with paved streets Валье-de-Bravo.
Hidden under эстакадами highways, he is in many ways the neighborhood of Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality, too, are a stark character of this city.
Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, selling drugs in these areas, were brought troops; and violence against women is here especially acute.
On пустыре near the vast landfills only over the past two years, it was discovered dozens of bodies of women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during губернаторства g-on Peña Nieto is significantly exceed this figure in the city of Ciudad-violence прославившемся Хуарес, the title of which it, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of on-Peña Nieto, about him, in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of the killing of women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of ignoring the problem.
The Vancouver Organizing Committee of concrete houses, like most of the homes in the area, обветшалом Иринея Буэндия barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana Moon.
Under the official version of the Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
But her family believes that it killed her inmate – a poor medical student.
"When I got up to her home, was like that, her body before this вымыли", recalls of membrane-Буэндия.
There were signs that it beat, and body already окоченело.
Mother Mariana narrates the story, and a portrait of daughter looks at us with the walls, where he hangs next to the crucifixion on which начертано just one word: Justice.
This, they said, was refused this family.
"Officials in treated me as with the old, сплетницей недовольной нарушительницей peace of mind.
They want people simply taken for granted all that, they say, and помалкивали.
But it is wrong, so can ’ t be, especially when so many human and недочетов, "she says.
By putting on a presidential перевязь on Saturday, the president of Peña Nieto together with it will assume the responsibility of a hard.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes related to violence, and the new president has promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that it will be exactly the same President, how was the governor of," says Olvera, Congressman from Валье-de-Bravo PRI.
But this is exactly what most fear family victims in Ciudad-Неса.
Bradley Manning not complained of poor treatment, the prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to rebut claims Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During a hearing special attention was given to stay Manning in military prison in Квантико, Virginia.
Protection requires to close the deal on the grounds that the conditions of Manning were brutal.
Where the US Army accused of kidnapping several thousands of secret documents.
On Friday the prosecution sought to prove that the Bradley Manning, accused of materials secured the biggest leak in the history of the United States, to take advantage of opportunities to submit a complaint to the abuse, which, he said, he had a chance to move, while in military prison.
During cross interrogation on outside hearing at Fort-free trade, Maryland, Military Prosecutor Maj. Эшден Feign said that the weekly visits Manning representatives of the administration in prison for nine months in Квантико, Virginia, do not contain complaints of abuse.
Caught in the interrogation of the application to end case Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his conclusions were brutal and by themselves were sufficient punishment, was held on the next day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide.
Military specialist analysis of intelligence data, who was arrested in June 2010, stands accused of kidnapping several thousands of secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published in the Internet on the site WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was exactly Manning.
During the hearings on Friday the prosecutor Feign together with Мэннингом просмотрел reports, which were after visits Manning representatives of administration during his stay in jail Квантико, where he was on a strict regime of from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits the prison officers asked Мэннингу questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Feign asked Friday about reports that Manning acknowledged that evaluates to itself on the part of the prison as "excellent", and the general terms of as "very professionally organized."
Discussed reports do not contain complaints of abuse, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the terms of its content, argues Feign.
Manning replied that he expressed concern about the writer of these problems and that the foreigners visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and alleged that they will, but not documented this in writing.
"They were" no problem "(after the discussion of my complaints), but it does not mean that I have not raised the subject in the interview," says Manning.
A military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why not complained of any treatment with him in January 2011, during a meeting of the commission, рассматривавшей suicide intentions, which he expressed in writing for a few months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve, that he was acquitted of the regime "prevent injury" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited the regime - on the level of lower than the supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect concluded, as well as for the sake of security of others.
"I would like to know that the administration with me all in order to cancel the regime to prevent injury... to the level of my life improved, from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he was almost two months before was transferred to a prison in applied-marine base in Квантико, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that the thoughts of suicide appeared at him in Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness from for-strong heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard when you do not know how to your fate, and what happens to the outside world.
"My world сжался to base Camp-Арифжан, to the size of my prison, Manning said on Thursday.
 - I thought I was going to die, in the cage. "
While in Квантико, Manning, in his words, spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day in total isolation.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, has a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that tried to move, so as to sleep or even simply lying during the day from the rules.
According to Manning, while they sleep in the eye, he constantly beat the light coming from the outside of the camera.
If guards did not see his face when he переворачивался in bed at night, then, he says, the whats and were forced to turn over on the back.
Lawyer Manning filed formal objection over illegitimate treatment with Мэннингом in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort-Ливенворт, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday the judge расспросила Manning on the statement, which he did during the testify on Thursday, that after one night it was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Квантико, his forced to stand swimming naked in front of the security guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning said that would not be able to hide behind a blanket during an inspection.
Answering the questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said that understood from the order guard that must throw blanket, which could hide, but acknowledged that no one right is not permissible to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night it was forced to sleep from swimming naked-for his attempts to show офицеру that it is safe for themselves.
Manning said that said офицеру that could use the widest or hand has to damage themselves, but did it.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, glasses and has taken away from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will take into consideration the fact that he had to endure at the time of the conclusion of, and significantly reduce time, in case if Manning found guilty military court, which should start to review his case at the beginning of next year.
Protection said that plans to offer Мэннингу admit blame for less serious crimes, and other charges challenge as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the charges will insist that the conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that Manning was in Квантико in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the strict regime.
Among the charges, charges Мэннингу, Ashton opponent pandering, illegal promotion обнародованию data on the Internet, the transmission of information related to national defense, and the abduction of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of justice, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national identity - the American Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to flee from the Mexico-for lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country about the difficult times.
Ruben Наваретте believes that Mexicans American origin caught between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed along a corridor for arriving, came close to the border control and has stalled on the spot.
Signs pointed to two: One for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my life called мексиканцем.
It is simply a code name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New-York consider themselves the Italians.
Later I stopped on a complex structure "American Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the land of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I say on-Spanish well enough to ask questions or to respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the native speakers, and I can not get rid of the US emphasis.
Because I took out my American passport and was in turn for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when Mexico ’ s newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were habitual for meetings with the presidents of these countries questions: Immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, rather than перебираться in the United States.
He wants to sign an agreement on cooperation with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals didn ’ t.
For Mexico relations with the United States is heavy and made of old grievances.
Most Americans have never thought about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under дулом rifles forced its leaders to abandon the half of its territory.
But the Mexicans to the great for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders about those events in all.
That is why it is worth only what-or the problems in the US обмолвиться though word criticism toward Mexico, in the media and among the elite of the Mexican society, there are complaints about what Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And descendants montezumae преисполняются воинственностью.
At the same time the most complex is Mexico ’ s relationship with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin living in the United States.
If you want to talk about обидах?
Their enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for themselves, and those for whom such opportunities.
In Los-Angeles-, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio-so many people of the Mexican origin for one reason: To what-the moment of their family history who-or - father and grandfather - did not have the opportunity to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of these were Mexicans a certain type of - blacky, малообразованные, from poor peasant families.
We their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the epitome of the American dream, we were in good schools and for good work, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not the Mexican.
Our national identity запутано and it is unclear, but we know what the country considered to be his.
The United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class, we do not like.
We guarantee them the same.
They see in us reminder of degrading lesions and refer to us as a people of the second grade, as ненастоящим Mexicans.
We are not good, and Spanish-speaking on our ties with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them because of the failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have gone.
We do not would be now for silk curtain, found in the US сытую life, but having lost spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of the Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans increases understand their national identity, and Americans of the Mexican origin is unfair.
It is a national of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of the Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Спрингстина.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will lose the roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the US, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with Diaspora.
They want the Americans to the Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and was represented by its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends-Americans about which it is a beautiful country and how cool it to visit, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Aha, of course.
Nothing will be released.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, binge of corruption and outlets, many of us does not believe that the country is really beautiful.
Sorry, but with this разбирайтесь themselves, Амигос.
And this is true.
If the majority of Mexicans still can not to forgive the United States, as they were with Mexico one and a half century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans Mexican origin are still in Point for how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes really.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.
The old battle on a new Middle East
An agreement on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundation for further world
Is it possible to lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound, as usual, mindless debate about who first began; a lot of buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the neighbourhood of the capital of Israel Tel-Авива and holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East came change.
This can be treated on-site, but the events of the "Arab Spring" in закружили мятежной буре many established realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not managed to remain aloof from the whirlwind, потрясшего region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that offer hope on the way out of this impasse death.
The war without the winners
At first glance, the usual situation gives no cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreement, which was signed on 21 November, will be executed, occurred this week collision only strengthened security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, come to power in Gaza in 2007, wide-spread from that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses they incurred.
In spite of the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is pursuing his popularity in the West Bank - another Palestinian territory controlled by now more moderate Fatah.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working in their favor.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which, when then-was the closest ally Israel among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
Two, the victorious Hamas supporters claim about creating around Israel Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, a militarized group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels here-here is overthrown power Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the power of King threaten Hamas ’ s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region in the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Morsi Мухаммеде bolstered influence movement Brothers-Muslims.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention support for Hamas.
Brothers-Muslims, by contrast, are, in many respects a parallel with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice can ’ t even trumped Israel and America.
At the same time, the advocates of "hard" line in Israel will come to different conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was crushed.
The Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" justified its costs for its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least what-the time.
As for diplomacy, the US remained true to their unchanging positions; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence by Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity Israel, especially when the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by missiles, released from the territory of Gaza, Israel managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-death row, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank is a significant part of the HDI Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime-Minister of Netanyahu ’ s Likud Party, whose - as part of the preparation to the set on January 22 election - teamed up with even more aggressively because conservatives under the guidance of Авигдора Либермана, very convenient.
What makes sense to the Palestinians and to give them their own state?
If to give their hands all authority on the territory of the West Bank, begin to whether they run from missiles toward Israel, as do their lips in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempts to lift the head.
Perhaps supporters of "hard" line to prevail, but their calculations can be disproved the Arab spring.
With that Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Part of the defense budget Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism Egyptian President, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on ceasefire, is a good sign, and may well mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not least, should take into account the long term consequences of his policies.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, a holder of the Palestinians ’ right to self determination represents a time bomb that sooner or later explode in the Israeli Occupied Territories, like автобусу, взорванному in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression is undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem.
For violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to clamp down on Hamas, must pay the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need in the external forced
Remains the only solution, to which call for relentlessly sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: Education two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.
Remains hope, not too powerful in the short term, is the hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which it is past time to decide if the delivery of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, taken since 1967 with the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, than the vote at the UN, the result of which can become virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.
Their role is to bring Israel at the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House in the still-demonstrates reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem.
This is tragically недальновидная position.
The United States vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, entered into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of the infested diseases body parts are контрастно on tiresome green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice of Australian law about однотипной packaging of cigarettes and other tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same depressing a box-olive color pictures жуткими disease struck parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been decimated smoking their parents.
In addition to the different images and writings, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between with buckets, introduced in order to this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print.
It is the most severe in the world for packs of tobacco products.
The federal government Australia says that the purpose of this measure is to keep the youth from smoking, depriving the harmful habit of fashionable status.
The basis for such a decision about the results of research, показавших that people do not smoke started to 26 years in 99 cases from 100 never are developed.
"It is obvious that even in the very beginning of the children, who are trying to understand the meaning of tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Плиберсек, referring to the study of the territory that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of Princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes is not especially be on profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures have already seen, and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly acceptance of the law.
Tobacco companies argue that it would only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his project," said Scott McIntyre, a representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For whom-that, on the contrary, new laws to business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that demand for портсигары and silicone cases, скрывающие unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies, such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court in Australia, where tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra ha, the company Zico has already implemented around six thousand products companies wholesale trade, and offers a new party.
For us it is a good business.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of these measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, which sent these measures.
After taking in Australia of a number of laws, illegal television advertising cigarettes and their support of sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers or cigarettes in plain sight, advertising tobacco products moved on the Internet.
Australian government banned local companies and web-sites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites.
"If you invest in tobacco distributor and you have remained only this small, do not confuse the idea to promote their products to the Internet, you may find the very can" - explains Bechi Freeman, writing questions of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of ostensibly normal users on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this is the case of an average citizen who is so loves Marlboro cigarettes, and four time and made video, or this is the advertising company?
Australian branch of the company British American Tobacco argues that the industry is now more busy adaptation to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: These states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all of these countries ’ trade relations with Australia very minor.
The WTO is expected by mid 2013.
According to Tani Плиберсек, the government found with other countries to make them similar laws about packaging.
In 2001, Canada, the first imposed the mandatory posting photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia is defiantly not obey innovations.
These pictures of me not задевают.
I simply do not the attention.
"Just выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь pack in his pocket," explains Victor El Hague why cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth cavity on the box since.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw - this is my little daughter.
James Йу, Head shop tobacco products King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same box task has been complicated by selection of goods on streets
"Before I have on unloading a new party would leave hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and to ban cigarette, then we would have told: What do OK, all Twente, close shop," he says, вскидывая hands up.
Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection is not so bad.
In the Republican Party, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft because mechanical failures and it was replaced by other aircraft, which we are pending.
Thus, I have had enough time to thinking about the nature of boredom.
I will not be able to fool you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help or books, magazines, no iPhone, nor even shops Free Trade.
But in recent times more scientists and experts on children ’ s development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored isn ’ t so bad.
This causes the brain to interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.
As in the modern world we all are constantly before how first-screen, the advantages of boredom are passing us.
It may be we need to seek to boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time.
We will come back to this.
Before I, like many, has seen that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not so, argues Peter TUI, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, author of the book "a fascinating history of boredom (" Boredom: A Lively History, argues Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom boasts very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii discovered Latin inscription about boredom, dating from the first century.
It remains an open question about how we understand away the tedium.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, адъюнкт-professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often изменялось.
Having studied materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boredom is when people want to ", but may not be engaged in the fact that would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between скукой and apathy, he says, is that скучающий people is not doing so-what would like to do.
When apathy wants to do nothing.
The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a "violation of attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time stretches slowly."
On each boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these wealth скучающие people see causes problems in the outer world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see problems in itself.
Sometimes it seems to us that we bored when, in fact, we just hard on the then-focus.
In his study "Незанятый mind: Definition of boredom from the point of view of the attention", published in the September issue of the journal outlines on titles Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an exit poll carried out by a previous experiment, participants who listened to the recording voices читающего magazine.
Some participants have heard a loud sounds not related to the case of TV programs, included in the next room, others have heard the same sounds on low volume, so their barely could disassemble, and a third group listened only record voice without external sound track.
Those participants who heard TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, other - it was difficult to focus, but they did not know the cause of this and is accused of boredom.
When we try to focus attention on difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause away the tedium, says Marc J. Фенске, адъюнкт-professor of neurology at the University of Гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do that or-неинтересное, "for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of a marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he goes on, is that when people start покачиваться up on a stool or paint каракули on a piece of paper, they do it from the boredom, but we now know that actually doing so just help not relax physically.
"The study found that children who do not prohibit ерзать and go round, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit kept", says Professor Фенске.
In what then-moments we are all feeling away the tedium: In the event of a delay in flight (as in my case), listening to the dull, неинтересный film.
But different people have different levels of propensity for boredom.
In the 1980-x ’ s to measure such individual peculiarities of researchers have developed a special "scale propensity for boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and assertions, for example, "Much of what I have to do, and однообразно монотонно" or "me too much interesting, so it does not have the time."
With the help of these questionnaires, researchers have determined that the boys скучают most girls, says Stephen Воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular with a variety of external stimuli.
But as a whole at teenagers often скучают.
In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he linked by using the pager from almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers announced that they bored in school and during the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.
While only 3% of parents noted that they bored.
Professor Larson notes that it has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that the "age of adolescent is the propensity for boredom," largely because children and teenagers do not allow to fully address than they do.
Back to my original question: Boredom is useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations it, according to the studies, can nudge people to absurd and dangerous individual actions, risky Gaming or abusing certain substances in efforts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between скукой and creativity, says Professor Воданович, who has spent studying the issue for more than two decades.
"So our brains tells us that should be in the then-other; this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New-York University.
This, however, the brain is not always knows, than it is better to do.
If you will be boring and you send our way this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you can make themselves better.
However, if you ’ re watching TV, you will be better only on what-the time, and soon it will take place.
So, if your child hunter and you give it to the iPad, it ceases to be entertained, but he did not learn to deal with скукой alone or as-or any other way to manage their time and employment, says Professor Фенске.
"But such skills independent regulation used in various situations," he argues.
Your child learns not only on their own to occupy themselves than-then, he is also studying self-control at all.
I do not think I should be as then-praised by.
But its than-something bad is not worth it.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agree with it.
"We see it is that we need more often I, with boredom is extremely worryingly, the unquenchable desire to tackle the then-conscious," he says.
In fact, people tend to like then-to disconnect from our concerns and just relax.
"In the modern world, we have grown used to the constant excessive stimulating the senses, ” he says, and when the silence, we теряемся and do not know what to do."
So far, it is not clear how it will be a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, девятнадцатилетний player soccer team and a student of public college for-eastern state of Colorado accused of committing a felony, consisting in what will soon be absolutely legally on the whole territory of the state: Possession of small amounts of marijuana and tubes, in which he its smoked.
G-n Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Ламаре and drove in the car to slowly near the border with Канзасом when they had been stopped.
After police found in the car, cannabis-well Orozco came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of device for the use of drugs, for each of which причитается a fine of $100 - and the appointed date.
"With us are treated as criminals," says g-n Orozco.
But the offender?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small trials depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration.
Charges of petty offences related to affects, already are removed in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which took a similar measure.
Police stations have already ceased to charges to be withdrawn people at the age of 21 and older for storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law will come into force.
However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine existing with affects, and still attract accountable for storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West ’ s vote to prevent the emergence of their new places, licensed to shops on the sale of marijuana.
"All of this is so rapidly that I do not even know what to expect further," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east from Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington, too, озадачено почесывают head.
They are to form the rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this should be done until December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the resolution of the issues, the first use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they will serve as a good example of the" - explains Bryan I. Smith, a representative of the Council for regulation of production and sales of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, recognizes the g-n Smith, than to what-the offers and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent that we could focus," he says.
Bill in Washington, called I-502, will take effect on December 6, and the whole year ввергнет staff in the state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right of ownership affects already узаконено.
And there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the state about "adequate access to" complete with марихуане ban on trade it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It is especially difficult will be licensed to trade affects within cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group "Center for legalization of marijuana."
On November 21, the police chief of Oates from Aurora sent out his underling email message that the Prosecutor General ’ s Office of the city will no longer attract people under the age of 21, accountable for possession of a small quantity of marijuana, and that the police stop уличать people in these violations "from this moment."
The police chief of Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal vendors and distributors of drug use.
The prosecutor of Weld in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the draft law, he said, the prosecutor ’ s office will be on-still attract accountable for possession of affects mainly to encourage the use of its people to pass the course of treatment.
At the moment, 119 parties charged in possession of two and less ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions - for actions that are considered criminal at the time you make them," said g-n Back in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous, even in places like rural District Mesa, where the vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police Grand Джанкшн, the biggest city in the district, no longer attracts to justice services for possession of a small number of drug.
District Attorney General Pete Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to charge on already open cases related to storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until he will not change is our primary responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, took part in the vote, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
And the confused reaction in different parts of the state ’ s ambiguity relations local authorities to experiment in the state.
"The county prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier" - explains Shawn MacAlister, денверский lawyer representing the interests of the condemned for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of марихуане.
"They harassed people for so long is that now can not by-now accept that this is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small quantity of marijuana are the same as for alcohol is destined to become the experimental field in the scope of the country to test the idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and officials plan to expand the state legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which still-plan to consider sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice lose on this issue.
Despite several received a resonance arrests traders and patients, papers marijuana for medical indications, the federal government in most cases provided welcome on trade affects for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau to fight drugs are unlikely to be fixes in home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become a blind eye to regulatory authorities in the shops of the recreational marijuana, which are permitted under the new law, believes Kevin A. Сабет, a former advisor to combat drug trafficking in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of the new shops selling marijuana, and so could not open up earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, has put forward for consideration six-month ban on trade affects, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in this position, that we supply you with whom the-license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have the apparent contradiction between the results of the local vote and voted for what state.
There remains a lot of issues outstanding.
Петронелла Уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for what I conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views, not today.
As much as I remember, I have always longed to do at Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - find and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studies on the faculty of Вустерского College Oxford University in the late Eighties, I gathered up and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.
My father was unable to and has begun to cry.
Friends were shot at.
Newspaper The Evening Standard argued that I dropped out of college, because I liked that my однокурсники sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from Щербатых cups.
In fact, all was not so funny.
Love.
Yes, сбежала, because I was systematically and intimidated.
Not from-for my rather unusual name or what I studied in a private school.
I was only one reason, and in this cradle of the famous просвещенности it was a barbaric and blind fanaticism: My father, the late Woodrow Уайэтт, was known as Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was сторонницей conservatives.
You ask, why remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, follows center-right views, is subjected to the same.
This институционализированная and constantly growing hatred of students-conservatives in Oxford so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, like the one which is disabled, the sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club college Case Christie in Cambridge claim that their "often actively protecting mucosa, personal attacks and make us feel нежеланными guests" from-for their political views.
They want to enter the Committee for the equal rights of college additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation only compounded released recently on BBC 2 a documentary about politics in student environment "Country miracles: Young, smart and the right", in which conservatives have presented эксцентриками and неонацистами.
In the film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives of the University of Oxford, who ’ s in-роллс ройсе, wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником.
In other university students-conservatives complain that they do "scapegoats from-for raising the cost of study."
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives this, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in the university environment mean wage increases in the direction of the left.
People, which we do not even know in advance believe us with impunity and наглыми {sides} violent children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the Faculty of college Case Christie, which was lodged a petition about enlarging the protection, calls the "неуютной", and Stephanie Черилл, 19 years, the new president of the Association of conservatives Oxford University, says that the members of the student club on the installation center-right views dramatically worsened.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I arrived there in September 1986 and робкой застенчивой восемнадцатилетней girl.
Oxford for the hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year before that, the University of voting has deprived the former) Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree from over-budget cuts in spending on higher education.
In this atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам.
In the first days of the week, when первокурсника students familiarize themselves with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that the Kyivites me ahead.
I did not know that teachers not only condoned Kostunica on травлю students-conservatives, but will gladly took part in it.
Political questions - the strike miners, privatization and disagreement governments to apply sanctions against the government of apartheid in South Africa - проникали through propose wooden panels walls audiences.
On my first seminar I had to translate the text in the eighteenth century to English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Уайэтт, said a teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please transfer the first paragraph."
The text was very hard on me, I hardly запиналась.
Harry Pitt was very желчным man with the face of, like cake.
"Тэтчеристы fundamentally not learn French or they simply brains lack?" He asked.
Other students захихикали.
In my eyes, by tears.
"I advise you to take a few basic lessons of the French in his spare time, if you will, of course, not very busy, rotating in society", - пробрюзжал Pitt.
I returned to their room very unhappy.
That evening in college I had for lunch one; then who then-похлопал me on the shoulder.
It was James, a student of the second course with the Department of English, which he as a member of the Association of conservatives.
"I know who you are, he said friendly.
 - Unfortunately, it is as follows:
Each of those suspected of supporting the conservatives will be издеваться.
To me the most is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most первокурсников-conservatives pretend that they Labour. "
Later, in the local pub, I tried to cowardly лицемерить.
I insisted that does not agree with all that says Margaret Thatcher.
Trick failed.
The Freshman of philosophy, politics and economics, which went to Eton, said: "You daughter fascist pigs.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was tainted, dirty.
"As conservatives sex? - asked one of them.
 - They колотят each other, right? "
I felt as must have felt homosexuals to abolish the prosecution in the sixties.
When I do-anything to live normal lives in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet with the Test Ban Treaty only under the patronage of the night?
Will I forced to become a Labor and hide their true beliefs?
The upcoming me three years began to seem like a living hell, full of hardship and solitude.
The only teacher in my college, not скрывавшим their conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that it was Thatcher ’ s adviser on foreign policy and one of its спичрайтеров.
In college, he almost did not.
He despised him for personal remoteness,, pettiness and commitment to марксистско-детерминистскому view on history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here, you ’ re not happy," he said.
I started to go to Oxford from parental home in London, trying to find refuge in the capital непредвзятых relatives and friends.
I said the father that hate Oxford and explained the cause.
I could not believe.
During his studies in сороковые years there were any political views.
"But because this is the best in the world, he said жалобно.
 - There is capable of, only not in the city of dormant spires.
Even my friends-Communists always behaved perfectly. "
His moist eyes помутнели.
"Do not pick up any hasty decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
You разобьешь I heart, if бросишь University. "
I was изнурена regular visits to London and my emotional protection слабела.
My friend, also a conservative, not withstood pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
Next week during the seminar, when another teacher history completely seriously called me "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that "I clean brains parents" and called them "old дураками."
Respite was short.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time, he wrote every week on two columns for publications, belonging to the demanded.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and after five minutes of my persecutors, blinked.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and village on the same train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But in eighteen years, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Prime-Minister Tories, but to this day is hiding behind the незаслуженной reputation University, in which value equality and find out.
"Valentino prefers elegance glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the furniture," which opened this week in London, ABC talk to the Nachi Abascal, they Thyssen-Борнемица and other famous female clients of Italian designer
Fitzroy Somerset-house, the former residence of the English Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, to take an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has acknowledged that during the opening of "Valentino: Master of the furniture," triumphant retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 gowns of high fashion, created his "home" for the past 50 years.
"Adore this Palace", he says, with its inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character which - "Iles синьоре" Garavani, but she could not be written without his eminent scientific research.
Valentino always felt очарованным rare and distant world elite.
In the first room of this exhibition, open up to 3 March, personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Салимы agha Khan-to Lord Сноудона, including Marie-Chantal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of their social rise: From a modest tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to idol international "elite".
Be enamored with the royal court, in that there is nothing wrong.
"They at least not cushion окурки their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as do some beautiful star pop-music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Борнемица.
In 60-x and 70-x, we both lived in the Alps, and were good friends.
Valentino - бесподобный owner and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"All of us are very liked to come to his chalet in Гштааде," explains the former wife "Heini" Thyssen, close girlfriend forgotten beauties like Мареллы Agnelli or wallaby F.Niarchos.

"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches is a true works of art", - is it.
Parade pedigrees
Life Garavani - history is not одержимостей, and loves with full reciprocate.
He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries Fitzroy Somerset-house was transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers change roles: A visitor takes place models and should дефилировать on the podium, overlooking the "viewers of" desktops that shine with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress, which chose Jacqueline Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Онассисом, costume, which used Monica Vitti in "Nights", or coat from wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Диба.
In this public from models блестают such names as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria, 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, Метте-Марит from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Nachi Abascal and designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
Remember his perfectly.
These were the trousers, shirt, "waistcoat" and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift, which I did," says Nachi Abascal, one of remained designer.
"Like his other for his valentine for his great love for women because it highlights our beauty", - the former Duchess de FERIA, Badajoz.
I really like color, which he uses: In them a lot of light and they "fit" to his face.
Proportions are ideal.
The Princess and законодательница mod Патрициа della Джовампаола d "Arenberg Château, too, can not forget the first time оделась in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will have the age and reason to wear one of his evening rooms...

I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on a holiday in the castle of my a dealing cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, "bustier bodice in" fold and strapless neckline.
"It was a dream," явью, says widow Rodrigo d "Аренберга.
"Valentino indifferent to the fashion, his passion is вневременное," explains this Italian аристократка, which lives between Paris, New-Йорком and Buenos-Айресом.

There are people, for whom the work is hell, and other literally work in hell.
Among them Anto Widjaja, one of 400 miners who earn on the life of sulphur in the volcano Кавах-Иджен, located in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends on the bottom of a crater is where сернистый gas, поднимающийся from the depths of the Earth, solidifies in contact with air.
Отколов huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on the shoulders and brings them to the top on обрывистой rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, which is 2.386 meters, only 250 metres, but изможденным грузчикам requires more than 40 minutes to rise at a snail's pace, barely holding the balance and carefully нащупывая road to not оступиться and not to fall over the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them life, as happened with one by from France, which collapsed a few years ago with rocks Кавах-Иджена.
Miners with Кавах-Иджена earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined
Once at the top, they weave their way between the tourists who downloaded them as if they were обезьянами from circus, and weary carrying heavy baskets, are three kilometres to balance that mining company расположила slightly higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
It is about DC Kandy Нгримби, the company, which has been running since 1960 this volcano, and it is best not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical manufacturing, in fact, this mineral distributed in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite is being accumulated throughout the region, and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As the norm is переноска 70 kilograms, we we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each ходку" - explains to us Anto, which usually carries out three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them, and at the end of the feels exhausted, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems мизером for such нечеловеческого efforts, three times more than what he would зарабатывал in the field.
"Поденная fee шахтарям very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," - expounds грузчик, who previously worked as obviously on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto has returned with his family in Баньюванги, the town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as massive as harder: "I married on the girl from Bali, where some индуисты, and he brought it to of Java, so that it adopted Islam."
Anto have asthma, he breathes with labor, constantly кашляет, and it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes from for-toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto spent three years, risking the Кавах-Иджене harder, which has already begun to take a toll on him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with labor, constantly кашляет, and it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes from for-toxic gases, which emits a volcano.
This is the price that he should pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"Поработаю two more years, because I want to open a store or to learn Spanish or French" - he promises on more than an acceptable English.
Наказанный life, this pleasant and clever young man could be a tourist guide, официантом or the receptionist at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.
Sharing the same dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he comes every day in two hours of the night, because the harder not to follow at night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and glitters in the gloom.
Challenging the shadows are allowed, Anto descends in the crater, when covering the road small фонарем, подсоединенным to his каске, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters pulled by them baskets with grey on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profit margins, mining company production механизировала sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам who work on your account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not receive even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) collection for photographing, which, along with the input ticket for 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards of the reserve is charged with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people-mules.
"This work for cattle, but not for people," said Бадрусин, stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on Кавах-Иджене three decades, since left College.
Able to raise up to 110 kg, he assures that it will tolerate work "as much as he can," because he needs the money for education of their three children from 6 to 10 years.
Not уйду retirement, was going to die here, because the volcano is all my life
Although harder обжигает throat and three eyes, when the wind suddenly change and catches miners in the densest pillars of smoke from the volcano, they are so the day that none complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their habitual problems with breathing, артрозы, pain in the lap and ulcers on the shoulders, which деформировались under the weight of baskets.
Балансируя basket on the back, Унайник now only can raise 50 kg at 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions handing out 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which carry a three at the warehouse in Тамансари, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow path among зарослей.
"Not уйду retirement, was going to die here, because the volcano is all my life," - says Унайник, opening his mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
One of his five children, Senior, 30 years, also works for decades sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most severe in the world: What do human мулы with Кавах-Иджена.
Singapore is looking for children, to save the economy
Сингапурцы accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"People need to Singapore to grow."
I husband patriot, you my wife патриотка, our civic duty and will create life!!!!!!!
It may seem inconceivable that these lines are part of the advertising limes pastilles, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the raps, which uses local saying such as "put her бао (булку) in an oven" to laugh over birth rates, in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which has made this video, the activity, enshrines the laudable hope that with the help of advertising they will draw attention to this issue in the form of entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to people have a "national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world as a member of a similar, so we felt that it is the theme that we must affect.
We knew that the government attempted to do much, for example to launch spirits with феромонами or organize parties fast (dating a blitz-dates).
Many of these ideas, may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why we don ’ t make the most креативную thing from possible to solve this problem, namely to make the rap?
1.2 child
Who does not perceive it so frivolously, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends 1.300 US dollars a year on policy to floating citizens on the birth of more children.
The package for couples and parents provides up to 15.000 dollars for a child, prolongs holiday parental and provides tax breaks.
But all of this has low effectiveness.
Singapore is a rich and high tech state-city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national governance by population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why not сингапурцы have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director for policy for couples and families National population, says that cause "improved education" and "a broader range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding, and the creation of the family,", she explains.
These changes social norms contribute to a rise in the number of холостяков and postponement of marriage and children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to confront a reduction in population, causes resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there is a web-sites, where flourishes barely скрываемая xenophobia against many of new immigrants, especially Chinese, which criticized for maintaining wages low and unwillingness to integrate.
The growth of immigration also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility is known for economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
Government efforts to not so much has been building a housing.
For example, this is the beginning of the influence of the real estate sector.
Guide to urban development to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoes box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote холостому lifestyle and incentive for developers who want to build a large family.
But Lim Yu sun, the CEO of the company домостроительной EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments раскупаются for a few days, weeks, even faster than the larger size.
As a result, our cash flow.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too перенапряженные
Singapore, a city-state.
While these new rules can be a step in the direction of increasing national birth rates, after a conversation with сингапурцами who work in the financial district centre, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very перенапряжены, housing, expensive, as well as education, and from-for this many people this delay," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to place their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as a reason that make it difficult for them to get children.
So, how would the government nor the leadership has tried to induce citizens to a birth of children, in terms of деторождения, a final word for сингапурцами.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is about the private property or the "personal life, which have the right to protect from any intervention."
That is the personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he applies this definition in their everyday life and social networks?
He understands the danger, which is under discussion on the Internet, which certainly not shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico took an interview with five children from 10 to 15 years, frequent users on the network.
In four cases, they ассоциировали term with "than the-very my", in private planes, and "password and username" when used it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I would not have downloaded in the post," says Jorge ten years, when trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"This is a very secret secrets, my mother can them to know, but not the whole world", he argues.
On FB I beautiful pictures or pictures of the games.
I also развлекаюсь with its familiar.
"I would not have shared a photo that is not my then-, or anyone who behaves foolish," he says.
The boy is aware that do not publish obscene photos, people, or to write offensive or fierce comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends that he had in FB Communication, and nine of its фолловеров on Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother of up to date, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I have a Twitter to express themselves and write interesting Tweet.
"I do not know, I, I only their possible," he adds.
"Social networks - entertainment, can I talk to distant relatives or with friends in rapid-", he points out.
Without a second thought, replies that never would request from Romanticism.
Would not be considered with whom-, it recommended that would незнакомцу.
The case of 14-summer José is different.
This was there are open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last acknowledges that knows no 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It scares me, because we have that then-general, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in trust and not asked his home address or phone number.
"If I will be pressed or require, just delete them from their account," he admits.
José became a disciple of the Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as кибермоббинг.
One acquaintance of my girlfriends blackmail in social network.
He threatened, extorted money.
"He never learned who it was", - assures it.
The victim, according to José, not removed the account.
"Only included privacy."
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure account safe way.
Unlike Jorge, the boy would be uploaded photos of friends in bulky or конфузных situations.
Yes, I did it, if the person I dislike or if I want to.
"Although I know that this кибермоббинг", - confirms it.
The key questions
Марьелос Porras, преподавательница English and an expert on education and training, believes that, in order to children and teenagers, you need to understand that the purpose of the social networks - to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as the tool for searching information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras indicates that the mark Пренски, master of pedagogy at Yale University, and author of labor Digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives, it is they, children and young people who were born in an era of technology.
"We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we learn for themselves," she says.
Explains that this theme complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria what can or cannot be to distribute, publish or to speak at the age of maturity, when not enough for this."
"Also they were избирательны, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences of", she added.
According to a specialist, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and teenagers, is to ask questions that make them think.
"Talk to them, so that they did not do this, futile", she added.
Then Porras lists some of the options: There are things that you do not told незнакомцу, so why would you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo of you like the one that you published about his friend?
Do you know that other publish about you?
When you подписываешь photos with parties, просишь whether you permission from other people to celebrate them?
And another, all I need to know that you do in every moment?
Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online as well, as do it offline.
The rules are the same.
"Beyond the person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should be in social networks," - says it.
Vigilance
Эстуардо Guardia university teacher, a professor of primary education and consultant on Education, explains the need to heads of families in good faith read politics, social networks.
Understanding each points, they have good reason for talking with their children about prerequisites opening an account in the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or to publish", he says.
According to the Guardia, the key question is remind children lesson "did not speak with strangers."

"South America must learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador President Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the aim, in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, Peru, state television said that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War," and in other clashes, "but now they almost one hope."
He defended, in this context, a project of the South American citizenship, which favor countries-members of the Unasur.
"You need to get the free movement of citizens and working for any South American country, as this is already happening with members of the Andean community, but until now there are reactionary sector who want to return us to the past," is the doctor has warned.
President эквадорский has proved, in addition, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the influence of Puritanism and taking into account those who signed Stability San Jose-about human rights.
Those who reads lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, южноамериканцы, on the contrary, sign everything.
"Inexplicably, that Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Assange side.
Correa assured that does not spare about this decision, because he is not предавал their principles, and maintained its "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in due time "were certain suspicions that Assange to be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process."
He criticized, moreover, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "by the Swedish law considers it prudent to make it through the video, which could make the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health Assange.
"I spoke with him since he arrived in our embassy, but Ambassador I reported that he had a small pneumonic problem, nothing serious," said эквадорский head of state.
What there is, is the danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health of for-история small space without the opportunity to do exercises on the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of refuge, Assange since June and approved by the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing guarantees immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the judiciary and stressed that there were talks in London about the search for a solution to the problem of lawful animal-welfare WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating about human rights, it is the word we in this case do not use, but there were constant debate.
"A solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer Assange, Baltasar Garson, keeps a set of processes in different European instances", - mentioned it.
And said that "if the UK tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, допросит economic Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or допросит it by Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the occasion to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, "bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"The enemies of freedom of the press is not tainted villains-policy and bad journalists, supporting jobs, blackmail and extortion," he said.
At this point he was satisfied that none of these journalists, "neither bankers, nor the bourgeois countries-гегемоны does not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, as a переизбранным, "will deepen the revolution to continue with the development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to veto of Paraguay in Unasur, at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be solid and does not tolerate opportunism and support of coups in the guise of legitimacy," because in reality, "it has eroded the legality of downfall."
President эквадорский found it, moreover, "very good" to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to now talks with Nicaragua on maritime border between the two countries after the decision by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which turned out to be the benefit of Nicaragua ’ s old maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not observed.
It is a problem between the South and Central American countries.
Conflict is inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
You need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good completion of a dispute about the maritime borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "the right for Latin America to the international court, if the two countries are obliged to make a decision, however difficult it was."
Regarding the ability to act as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if to lose the election in February, 2013, it will fade from public life.
Personally, I was never interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed on the part of political power.
"My political movement be, what exactly I guaranteed this likely victory, so have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In the case of a victory that would be my last term in office, the president, and then we emerge from public life.
If will lose, the same.
"This decision", - has confirmed it.
Correa also mentioned the new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-president Ronin Maduro, who told me that he has gone on treatment, which has already been planned, рутинное, and that it is expected that it will campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the escalation of President Chávez ’ s health," he explained.
The head of the state эквадорского participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like are stunned during battle," he recalls the difficult, despite all the time to the doctor.
The young man concealed it from his family.
To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible, and his efforts frustrated - he has already said a 43-long birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest "patients" HIV-branch of the hospital, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he appeared in 1994, breaking many obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis "by" (HIV) for 22 years. In the beginning of 90-х in it would be difficult to believe, then there was too little treatment options, too little known about the disease, too jaundiced treated patients.
Even so, the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security is not wanted to say goodbye to him, "because he was порез."
In other words, in those days have AIDS was an independent and impartial.
It is now possible to survive in this синдроме and do it, not the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about their illness, so far, many people come, when the virus already crippled, "drew down" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, "a great achievement at this time is that the survival of the patient, who begins to treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same", - pointed out, the head of the HIV-of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information has been confirmed by in April of this year, in the prestigious scientific edition.
Инфекционист and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not impartial, but the duration of and quality of life depends on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the expected life expectancy for those who do not consume drugs: Up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when reported about 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that the one who gets diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years", he explained.
To assess the progress, it is necessary to remember that life expectancy Mexicans today at an average annual rate of 76 years.
Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report from UNAIDS), it is also true that from the moment of occurrence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; however, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 - Why until now there are a lethal outcomes?
 - Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I have it, as is the case in our hospital.
At least the past 12 years we have had no shortage of медикаментах, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know about his инфицированном state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He brought Anatoly data: "Nine out of ten patients come when already have what first-оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect in mass scale, for all the people that this will be asked to".
In its offer opined experts and officials of the State Council for prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients, such as Fabrizio, which turned to check in private laboratory побужденный only by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой Капоши, realized by the tumor, which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you had AIDS.
Some think that will die, and don ’ t want to know.
"Once all the same to die, I am надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I well питаюсь, do exercises, accept the drugs.

Given the ratification Shirinyan trial continued the United States solution that void the debt restructuring Group, try достигнутую through competitive production in Mexico, scenario sets a precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country, which has solvency problems.

In the practical, approval of the solutions, sentenced on June 15, judge Харлин Hale in court in the northern district of Texas, leaves threatened Mexican firm in the face of the capabilities of the arrest on their property on the side of the Rio Grande-.
But the decision opens the door leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in proof of three imbalances.
As an entry, while the judge the case notes that lenders should be regulated Code of Conduct, the US bankruptcy, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth, located in New Orleans, said that the trial for the competitive manufacture, considered in Mexico.
The first point implies the cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in case of insolvency transnational companies.

However, the ability to recognize the Mexican laws.
In fact, try was not the first time that is accepted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose межфирменные debt guaranteed the Federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or the other creditors try, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds "стервятники" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would have made of the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.

So far, the company family González Sada would demand appeal at the Court of Appeals to vote came to his tail-end, that is, the five judges, as voted only three.
In the case of неуспеха will be charged to you, which will require review process by the Court of Appeals, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worse still, the Court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which described the process, which should try in the framework of the competitive industry, signaling that he frees herself from the agreements signed by both countries to associate it with Article 15 of the US bankruptcy.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Заядлый basketball traveller Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, the world.
Few in Puerto-Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And in fact before hemorrhage in the brain 45 him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, in a small, the player ’ s Basketball League, authorized and head of BSN with ковбоями Баямона and president of the Federation of basketball.
"I carried out many roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at once, as when I was president of the BSN, general director of the National team, and the president of the federation in 90-x ’ s", recalls Reyes during the visit of the Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photos and stories of things, gathered for a long way, testify about this.
In the heart of Bayamón, Puerto Rico
The emotion he keeps those who remember his way through cowboy, starting with the 50-x ’ s as a player until 1982, when under the age of 15 years of his performances in the role of with-agent or agent contract.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships cowboy since 1967, as agent, with-agent or manager.
It was for many years, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I all one in 1981, a year debut Джерома Минси in BSN.
From the moment and continue to lead became "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator ", - pointed out Reyes.
I remember that gene Bartow, Germany, which went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you there is a very strong player, the growth of 6 '7".
"You want?"
And it was the beginning of the Минси, one of the best players, who were at the Puerto-Rico.
Bartov then recommend снайпера Raymonda Carl Friedrich Gauss, which received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Минси brought the Баямону, Gauss would have helped to win another.
With cowboy Чемпионством Гауссом I насладился, but at a distance, because to 1988, already was member of the head of the federation.
By that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements Минси in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we have received the fourth place and it should be, if not the Canadian judge, which has forced us to play the final game, Reyes said.
The team with the World Cup 1990 - this is the best team, what you when-or saw?
It among the best, as well as one that won the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the one that games with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed was the United States, which was quite similar to that which we have won bronze at the World Cup.
In the team not only once again played Минси, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and 'Пикулина' (Ортиса), but also the young (Javier) 'Тоньито' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Кихоте' Morales, who could not participate in the 90-year from the knee injury.
The team, which probably was not the best in terms of personal composition, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the Olympic qualifying tournament in a 1995, Argentina.
Communicative activities like role players like 'Канито' Ньевеса, Pablo Алисеа and young Rolando Хурруитнера instead of players, temporarily estranged for the mess in the Панамериканском-Mar del Plata (-, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto-Rico?
Without doubt, it was Пикулин Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in the Puerto-Rico not dominated by at this level, as did Пикулин.
And that is without taking into account of his career in various leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best пуэрториканцем leader?
It is a very complicated question.
We had a very nice young, including Julio Toro, Flora Мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymonda, Далмау Армандито.
From the young, I really like the work of Leo Ариллы.
What do you think is the main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the beginning of 90-х in BSN was to 17 teams of the season.
What you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to make, for example, regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national плей-off.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary.
At the very least, I see the fruits of obligatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
This gives me.
Now what do you do?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my times on YouTube, 'm enjoying their grandchildren and occasionally go into the basketball games.
And, of course, the'm enjoying my wife, Иcабель, which has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died

He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was a creative, generous, cheerful, tender and talented, and I am very bored on it.
"He was the original personality and lived to the hilt," - confirmed Gray in the statement.

But it is his studio interpretation of deliciously disgusting J.R. led Хэгмэна on top of fame.
Drama Series CBS about the clan of the Ewings and other characters in its environment, walked in the air from April 1978 in May 1991.
Advertising slogan "Who could only shoot in the J.R.?", is to create the hype around episode, full of emotions, in which a character Хэгмэна just does not kill, spawned international discussion and millions of dollars, which risked in your favourite team.
It also helped to cut the audience at that time.

Hagman played Юинга as ненасытного corrupt with a charismatic smile: Dishonest entrepreneur and incorrect husband, who wanted to his wife алкоголичку, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was placed on the treatment.
"I know that should be in a sepulchral stove Ambrose Price Mondays at 10 pm.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be said: "Here rests honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It is the only deal, which he lost.
Victoria Principal, too, the heroine of the original series, вспоминала on Friday as Хэгмэна whom-the "huge, both in and outside the screen."
He experience and is indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who had the good fortune to know and love it.

The course, which examines "the End of the World"
Every week, students explore апокалиптические phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religion professor Stuart let decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that had the irresistible lure: End of the "long countdown" Calendar Maya, December 21, for which many people have for proof that to come the end of the world.
But let had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: The catastrophic hurricane sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "долгоармагеддоном", and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the end of the Christian theorists believe that will start the Apocalypse.
"I am not aware that this will be the most апокалиптический semester of all," said let this week, students at the University of Рутгерс-Камден-( New Jersey).
If to analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if there is only 30 days, it was really good.
And remember that bad well for those who have the image of апокалиптический thoughts.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the topic of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the latter in history.
In Темпльском адъюнкт-University Professor Barry Вакер reads the course "Means of media, culture and the end of the world".
Every week, students explore апокалиптические themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are distributed over time," he said, and the way that offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain actions.
If a nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, may be the war.
This month, students analyzed it films on апокалиптические themes and looked at how they interact with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell students that perhaps probably makes sense and is impossible," said Вакер.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Ресталл and his colleague Amara Solari, адъюнкт-professor of art history and anthropology, and to read the course, which is simply called "End of the world."
"We do not add '2012', to always be able to read the course again, if the end of the world will not," said Ресталл.
Despite the "inevitable eviction destruction", students must learn to cook projects and to the final exams.
In Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse that students have no choice but to work "to the most nights, which supposedly will come the end of the world," said Ресталл.
Courses were quite popular.
"Space ended for two hours," said Ресталл about its course for students with high average stands for, which have registered 35 students.
We received email for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked whether there are still places.
The students, in turn, Russians, Georgians, Tatarts, Molokans, that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe that make people to soothe themselves," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year student of religion and sociology from Хаддонфилда, New Jersey-to-Рутгерс Камден.
And апокалиптический image of thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a question of solace or its absence.
Will Векеса, 25-year student of psychology and nursing, said that looked all апокалиптические movies.
"I have never heard about the course, which would have learned this," he noted.
I like it.
But none of those interviewed - not to mention the Muslim - not said that believes in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project touched the prophecy of Maya, and in some ways we have discredited," said Julie Зеглен, 21-summer in the Темпльском University of West-Честера.
Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said Ресталл.
But he noted that there are апокалиптическое concern in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to changes around itself, предсказывая the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people do not think about it," he said.
Mainly in англоговорящем world.
Joseph Догерти, a professor of religion at the University of La-Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of if he knows about what first-aware of "the end of the world".
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the appeal court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Ресталл drew attention to the fact that for a long time about the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing happens December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or философствовать that December 21 is the beginning of its period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some have said that they were going to go to parties "the end of the world".
"Maybe why who then-of friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, 20-year student of the connection.
