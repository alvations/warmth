At the end of trade, the stock exchange of Prague tilted in the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the 100,000-dollar réctifia Prague its losses. 
The transactions with the actions ČEZ reached almost half the usual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, at the start of trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with the fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent. 
This time, the reduction is due to the fall of the Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market with the outcome of the vote in the House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the stabilization of the US financial sector is also visible. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
The Asian markets experienced a dramatic fall, even if the evidence succeeded during the course of the day, to remove some of the losses. 
The key Hang Seng index of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong lost four percent for trade, but later, it erased some of the losses and reduced the reduction was closer to 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese actions in the stock market of Hong Kong lost 3.8 percent, the markets are closed in Shanghai. 
The actions of the 100,000-dollar Sydney lost more than five percent, but finally we manage to reduce losses at 4.3 percent. 
According to its Index, the Stock Exchange of Taiwan lost 3.6 percent. 
"The hesitation about action to rescue the US will influence on the financial markets of the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the office of Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level that the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal of supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk that other countries are suffering the effects. 
The bloodshed of US actions 
On Monday, the House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, which it would have had to spend up to $700 billion (nearly 12 fret of Kč). 
The legislators refused to acknowledge the appeal for support of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy. 
American actions lived, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main share indices experienced the biggest fall of the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, following a fall of such a scale for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress gave up: the government of the United States can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader agreement of financial aid to the US financial system. 
It will be put to the vote early next week. 
American legislators carried out a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion kroner), given the US financial system. 
The success is not so sure. 
Indeed, before to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan of supporting the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Dit Sunday to the Reuters news agency Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee of the banking and financial regulation. 
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanism by which the markets can be effective, will follow a "disappointment.". 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
We have resolved our views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilize the market, "entrusted to the Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
In it, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday. 
In the early hours of Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form. 
It should buy, with financial companies to sell property assets that financial companies in huge losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and must be effective, also on the market. 
We need to continue with this plan to restore the markets, but I think we are, "Paulson said. 
A signal for the Asian trade 
The global financial crisis has a great impact on the markets of actions that fall. 
According to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat escaped legislators are so that Congress will lead to a final agreement by Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time, where the Congress's decision could have an influence on the exchange Monday. 
However, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two houses of the US Congress will do so in the vote if the negotiations do not remain blocked at the last moment, for this or that problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the days to come. 
However, the law still to see many changes. 
The total amount designed to the help of the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as the President George Bush, will be available as soon as possible. 
But if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil his office, he has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount in two stages: first 100 billion dollars, and then, finally, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr Bush greetted progress in the negotiations 
Although the President can put its veto to this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to get the finances for the purchase of the bad mortgage securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not in a position to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed to the vote of the law, and the Senate on Monday, "named the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
US President George Bush himself is happy with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto said that Bush was happy with the progress made and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.". 
Marketing executive neither 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement relief, development of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also plans to limit the executive parachutes to the directors of companies participating in the programme and it establishes a committee which will ensure the monitoring of funds. 
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will be effective and to the market and for all Americans," Paulson said. 
The plan also includes aid for property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advances in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing salaries of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: A psychological aid 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult. 
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the acquisition of assets to problems. 
This will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week, the iHNed.cz. server 
If the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important. 
"It is much more important that the congressmans agree, this week that they support this plan and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological importance of the agreement, with the approval of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, "stressed Marek. 
A fight taken to extremes: MP3 players against the mobile. 
You advise, how to choose 
While almost all the mobile can read the MP3 files, any MP3 player knows telephone. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Nonetheless, there are enough reasons to procure a reader. 
The choice depends entirely on the way to use and demands of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy the house a gramophone upmarket expensive to implement the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such products are not musical album on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
However, if your shelves records vinyls crowded, with art rock, jazz or blues, you dream at least probably such a gramophone. 
It is the music for the movement, namely music compressed, to say the simplified music in MP3. 
Here too, there are categories on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be difficult to sustain the headphones bought for 20 koruny the market. 
That is two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
The life of batteries is also decisive 
Some top-of-the-range music players are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, the most mobile. 
No current apparatus universal also is that the telephone. 
Alongside the primary functions, telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is able to read music and films, to register them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, to be used for navigation. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that no refrigerator knows roast meat and that no television will take photographs, we are almost a miracle. 
However, the universal nature of the motive is not without drawbacks. 
In the number of functions that you use is high, the more time between two rechargings will be reduced. 
And the reading of the music is one of the most important energy pigs. 
The mobile few who are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower. 
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient. 
In the case of cheap mobile, will they will play music for a few hours. 
If, in addition, it is to call from time to time, procurez-vous, to be sure, a second recharge for the work, this is the case for more expensive. 
The problem does not arise for MP3 players, which are able, following a recharging, a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less productive. 
Another problem arises in the registration of the music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the aircraft has a USB universal connector, that not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
There is, of course, make music directly on the map, but little card readers know go without reduction, given the tiny memory cards used in the mobile. 
With regard to the readers, you need, without exception (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fulfil, through the USB connector, the apparatus of music from the computer. 
Most of the mobile and readers will create themselves a library media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album of the style, or even after the trial of the user. 
Some aircraft is showing that an index with a tree structure, in the manner of the Explorer, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon smart phones with operating system). 
The readers are more easy to manipulate, the mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of a plane, get so absorbed in the life of the battery, the memory, the quality and type of her and, of course, to the ease of the order. 
If the music is for you, essentially, a noise and if the day you go to listen for a limited period of time, such as taking the tram, you need only read the mobile any. 
Almost all the motives are today. 
You are not even obliged to too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music which will get to you will take this format. 
It is one of the most common formats and from him, the vast majority of aircraft can also read music from the WMA format. 
The PCA (format used by the company, Apple and its iPods), it is less. 
The top-of-the-range mobile also allow, for example, the purchase of music online. 
It is enough to visit since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier corresponding) and buy the song or album. 
This alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile music. 
The offer of operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited, in most cases, the radio tubes quickly facts. 
Prices are not the lowest. 
However, it is generally believed that the way to buy music (by GSM, Internet, or by the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most of the people are always their mobiles on itself. 
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile, your pocket when you have forgotten your MP3 player at home. 
However, it is also important if you have always on you the headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the included, that have almost all the mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of musical mobile is their prices. 
The cheaper normally cost less than three thousand. 
For a three four thousand koruny, you can have a walkman already very suitable. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best telephones and better equipped, provided an entry for ordinary headphones, no more than 15 000. 
The readers, by contrast, have the advantage of having a easy control. 
Really it is important to ensure the order of the most rudimentary – which do not necessarily correspond to the less expensive (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with a tape, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by a bill of transmission of data. 
What aircraft choose 
Even the cheapest mobile (ex. The Vodafone 527) have a slot for memory cards exchangeable (the kind M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor. 
But be careful. 
The basic models do not support in principle that maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive to do with memory of 8 GB. 
If you have a mobile and still want to buy an MP3 player, take a Cowon, Creative, Samsung, Sony, a Emgeton or a iriver. 
Depending on the ability (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 kronor. 
If you are part of auditors more demanding, choose rather mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These appliances are with independent control keys for MP3, and it is the ease of the order is closer to that of an MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, the mobile number walkman have the same user menu of MP3 players sold separately, is the one who went to further in this area. 
The same service, in the same category, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and a life of the battery (normally 15 hours to 35 hours), is covered by an MP3 player produced by a mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively late, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, there is still something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not for a long time. 
We have already mentioned repeatedly on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The ČTÚ (The Czech Office of Telecommunications), which pointed out that the price of a SMS was higher here than in the rest of the EU, has confirmed. 
This is not the last, the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could happen - SMS sent from abroad to some customers cheaper Czech mobile operators of the country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a competition that really would like to join in the fight. 
This may seem paradoxical, since we have when even three mobile networks and penetration which goes far beyond the 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competed with. 
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Office (ČTÚ) telecommunications, which has said several times that in the Czech Republic, there is no place for another operator, choruses with operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network apparently has a chance (to now, it would be difficult to frequencies). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which has led to a substantial reduction in prices, which were subsequently react the traditional operators. 
However, even before the entry of hold such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, similar to those that is now home to effect in Britain. 
However, it is clear that there was room for such operators and they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples of this. 
In February we were informed of the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country. 
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has, among other things, the U: fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators as the opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group. 
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers that a trader. 
They are, in fact, free of cost of construction, operation and mobile network is relatively high. 
This is how in the world, the virtual operators are as operators to low costs – they propose calls and text messages, which is often balanced by a limited supply of services. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, said at least two times less expensive than its competitors. 
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland, focusing on a target group unusual can also be a good time. 
Indeed, the operator is specifically men. 
"The real men choose Mobilking, an operator who want, and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also walk among us. 
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based on the majority of virtual operators. 
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators 
It is, however, almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success in the Czech Republic, but the negotiations are not very developers. 
The launch of Mobilking will be rather place in other countries of our region, "said in a telephone has for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial group Penta. 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to that a potential competitor may appear. 
The group GTS Novera, which would take a step and again to become a real competitor to Telefonika in the field of business customers, for quite a long time, his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We are anxious to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already conducted negotiations with several times with the whole of Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is perhaps promising. 
According to unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, is accompanied by a complete silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment, no matter with a serious and complex project in this area has contacted, "said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz. 
Other operators are also refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not recorded for the time being viable project and bilaterally advantageous, which could serve as a basis." 
And she said: "It is almost impossible for a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
To operate in such a short space of time limited, we should have a specific agreement. " 
Vodafone heads rather its attention on the performance of requests for its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of expenses and infrastructure. 
That is what we, means more contributions from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a network for a mobile Internet. " 
The authorities responsible: in line with the operators 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and a reduction in their benefits. 
What good is to facilitate the creation of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know understanding as thieves in fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U: fon witness. 
The apparent greater pressure on the ČTÚ, during the creation of the U: fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile. 
In witness to the information available to the public learned of web pages of the ČTÚ. 
Today, the U: fon is used as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová has noticed this subject: "The competition in the mobile market has been, more recently, amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an extra player would put the blueprint, and above all its services, high standards. " 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulatory agencies is disconcerting. 
It is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, it adopted, faced with this problem, its position typical. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement has been concluded for the moment, because the supply of potential interest has no presented enough interest in the traditional operators, "he said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the department of external relations for the ÚOHS. 
A statement should not surprise and not as representatives of operators. 
But the hand of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also take care that nobody uses his position on the market, such a statement is confusing. 
Moreover, Kristián Chalupa added: "In abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in the price of mobile telephone services." 
However, pressure in the direction of a functioning market honest and lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS. 
What is shocking is the harmony almost touching the three mobile operators, which is their reactions. 
The question, it really is a coincidence, is of course. 
In the same way, the price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is surely due to the accident and the hard struggle of competition. 
"The office has not, in this regard, signs of a anticompétitif, there is no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators has a dominant position, none has a corresponding responsibility of his behaviour on the market. 
The tools to the opening of the mobile market virtual operators are probably even the telecommunications regulator, "Chaloupa said in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, that the telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market. 
However, some experts of the right propose another vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator, it must obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
This is the way it is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its business. 
However, even without recognising this argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, the complaints of many interested (including the GTS Novera society, already mentioned) show they face in the negotiations with all the operators, similar constraints. 
To land the responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common in communications, through which the ÚOHS wash the hands of the matter. 
We have already seen this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
It has unfortunately failed to pass in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted an enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement of the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS very well, but their interests are apparently the other. 
When no one look, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual sham operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies issuing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are only public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of firms dealing with the multi-level marketing. 
The particularised mobile phone services are proposed by example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists of these firms are generally to elected representatives. 
The magic is in the fact that the company to the operator is a classic company, who commands a large quantity of SIM cards. 
As important client, it gets offers of prices (and other special). 
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale. 
"If there is what you are talking about, it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we look and that could lead to a halt in cooperation with the company in question," responded to our question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity is not in the mobile operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned it could be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, to speak out against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these companies make their non-négligeables benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators real, they do not threaten them with their own marketing. 
Miroslav Čepický said the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by a percentage of customers. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their telephone is not recorded in their name, they cannot be fully, the way ordinary customers mobile operators. " 
However, it is precisely that should seem strange at ČTÚ. 
Moreover, there is another question to the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It must be added that ÚOHS has fairly broad powers to disclose such an activity and, if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim had no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions the banning. 
When we will no longer be the most expensive country 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a substantial reduction in the price of services. 
However, in nearly every country where appeared of virtual operators, the traditional operators are trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these were virtually the same - a market too small or too crowded, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely at this level that are spoken in the developed countries, the regulators, who were not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers. 
Both by formal steps that informal pressure, they have managed to create a virtual operator first, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators treat this issue in the way of a hot potato which are disposed of in order to provide a target. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in the competence is in these cases more profitable. 
But let us not throw the leg after the hit. 
If the information is true scenes and a virtual operator will appear soon, the Czech mobile market will recover perhaps movement. 
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not that hard to remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) other interested. 
And we continue to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Hear the four achievements of the new version of the national anthem. 
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of the Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?). 
The anthem has been recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a female or male solo song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version. 
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz. server 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he had already given to the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for the interpretation of the solo versions of singers with voices young and representative, who are marked and appreciated. 
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the chorus, have a good diction, so that we understand the words they sing of simultaneous way," he said. 
The Czech national anthem, next year, will celebrate its 175è anniversary. 
The song Kde domov můj rings for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre of states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse), original cobblers of Czech Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup. 
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first song, of course, became an integral part of the national anthem. 
It remained one of the seven national symbols, even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
How sounds "the new anthem" 
The transport (MHD's) introduced, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport) as the date on which will ride on the subway, trams and buses the first passengers, which, instead of having a paper ticket, a ticket in their pocket. 
At the moment, it is accessible to almost hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card. 
The passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both to register on their smart card information points in the Dopravní and the offices of the podnik (the Transport), located in the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská, Kačerov and zahrada. 
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the tickets by Internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik www.dpp.cz.: 
More than four hundred people profitted of service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the online store can forget all the windows in the subway system, where they were until now to speak in long lines in order to get the paper tickets. 
Indeed, they will buy their ticket by Internet and we will die on their card Opencard in one of the 13 Městská knihovna (libraries. 
"In these contact points, there are at the disposal of passengers a counter with trained staff, which will help the concerned with the purchase by the Internet, and more, will the ticket they bought on their cards," said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný. 
Alongside the libraries, it will be possible to record the electronic tickets on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several subway stations. 
What are these distributors? 
They are red, machinery to perforate the tickets and passengers have perhaps already noticed in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be 80," added Opatrný. 
A robot will monitor the ticket to the place of the driver 
The robots that will work out tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is enough to introduce the Opencard smart card and the ticket bought earlier will register itself on the map. 
The electronic tickets are valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city. 
In the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 439, that use the common people of the Central Bohemia for access to the capital. 
"In the trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport of Prague), the inspectors are equipped with card readers, which they establish the zonal and temporary validity of coupons," said Filip Drápal notes the control of the Ropid organisation, which sees the working hours of transport Prague. 
The suburban bus are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver. 
At the boarding it is necessary not only to show the smart card the driver, but it must also put the Opencard to the right place on the side of the box. 
That is how the driver control the validity of the coupons. 
"In cases where the passenger would need to check the validity of the coupons, there is nothing easier to ask for this information to the driver," completed Drápal. 
The passengers who do not take the bus and suburban recall the date on which expires the validity of their ticket, can join the vending machines, originally used to record the coupons on the map. 
That is, on the screen of the device that will display the information on the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten region demanded a referendum in the USA 
The Sudeten Germans were in 1945 that Šumava is included in the United States. 
This is a letter tabled in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Library scientific southern Bohemia. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the management of the United States of America. 
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly were addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire. 
This is one of a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
The Český Germans Krumlov request in the letter to the president not to allow "šumavská župa" (region of forest in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler in accordance with the agreement of Munich, went to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the US troops on German soil not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, which the fate of the Šumava is close to my heart.". 
Given that the rally to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising – with the Czech national - that of brutality, ruthless attitude, lack of understanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter request US President to take in its hands the protectorat of the Šumava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe that you would give the territory to a foreign state, who oppresses and destroyed the minorities and who has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million people," is written in the letter. 
The reason alleged, for which the perpetrators cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge "Czech oppressors.". 
If the President of the United States doubted the Šumava Germans, it would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if its people wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the management of the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war period, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
While the Czech Germans should at least see that the question of the expulsion of the Republic will arise, very few of them are acknowledged such a possibility. 
Some expected that the United States and Britain would get the Sudeten region some type of autonomy. 
Others believed they would quite simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České, the Budějovice confirms. 
During the war, it was, as a German of České Budějovice, committed in the Navy in the Baltic countries. 
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the capture of the region Holstein, dozens of Czech Germans were consulted so that they learn Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, Czech their would be beneficial," said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, said that, following the Beneš Décrets, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You do not think – you pay for. 
An emotional campaign will drivers 
The action road safety the more costly in the history of the Czech Republic. 
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the intention to launch Wednesday, the ministry of transport. 
The office of the Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage the drivers of the driving and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before start. 
It is primarily affect the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the ads? 
Above all the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Witness also the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign. 
You do not think – you pay for. 
The phrase "You do not consider" is written in capital letters on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, the phrase "You will pay.". 
What must symbolize that we can pay to the moment of inattention. 
The spots will "haunt" spectators until 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly images with drastic images of victims of accidents. 
It is believed that this will lead to a reduction in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads, Czech Republic. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers 
"What works with the drivers, it is the system of sugar and whip. 
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by winning time, when they burn a red light. 
The boost, it is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks must be recalled to the drivers, "said Martin Kořán, the psychologist Transport of hospital Na Homolce. 
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially of the negative advertising, the psychologist. 
The signs are pointing out the danger to drivers, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static panel which warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will see the most," announced Kořán. 
Olmert would exchange of peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the interim government, is pronounced in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
It made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all," said Olmert. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory), because without it, the peace will not happen," can smuggle into. 
He admitted that the return possible would include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will need to relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a solution for the Temple Mount, sacred places and historic "located inside the Old City. 
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, "souligna-t-il. 
Retraite of the Golan Heights 
Olmert made also in favour of the retirement of Israel of the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, it also would require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria on the basis of a pension of the Golan Heights," signala-t-il. 
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to give up to get the Golan Heights. 
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Shiite movement Hezbollah); they will have to give up the constant support they are giving the terrorism of Shiite movement (Hamas), Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), even that of the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "clarified the Prime Minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: The stewards in the because they are illegal? 
The law ignored; walk in a long distance is banned. 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of society Student Agency near Padova, in Italy, the question if the stewards and passengers can during the journey move inside the bus. 
"If we wanted to enforce the law strictly, the formal and a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which has killed a host of 22 years, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which has crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was at that time, unfortunately, sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal other two seats. 
However, the bus can have an accident, or stop of a sudden, also at a time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What is important is whether the bus is by virtue of its technical statement equipped places standing or not. 
If this equipment to places standing is not approved, passengers must sit. 
The coaches long distance Student Agency do not have seats up; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura. 
"It is a question that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, "he unveiled its position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription has this role. 
On the other hand, no legal provision prohibits not the carrier to offer services. 
The law on road transport is only the term recipients of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "with more ambiguity Hanzelka spokesman. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles, on the contrary, that the law is sufficiently the problem. 
"Everything depends on when the bus in his approval permission to propose places. 
Everything is there, "he said. 
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are places and a maximum speed limited trunk, with seats and a speed allowed more high and long distance buses without place standing with the maximum speed and highest seats equipped with safety belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert in BESIP (safety of the traffic) security in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem. 
"At a movement, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft. 
But it is not sure when will be turbulence and the flight attendant can beat your head. " 
"However, in the case where the bus would have resulted in a sharp, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
In the same way that in a city bus or in a tram. 
The carrier must handle security stewards by internal regulations, "he said and also think that the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved. 
Jančura is ready to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only Iraqi-born coach to offer the services of stewards. 
It employs two hundred. 
Even after this incident, the director does not consider their profession as a profession. 
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a profession, I will take away. 
The passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding. 
This would reduce the costs, "he said. 
The concern is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in cars, the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which compared with SA, a very small number of lines. 
"We have no guests. We are opposed from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, "he said, there is a years, to Týden.cz. 
A great tragedy arrived 
A young hostess of the region of Plzeň, who worked for the company over two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian truck probably quité the emergency without using indicator and it has blocked the way to the bus. 
The driver to try to avoid it by means of a sudden, but he has had his right side. 
Jančura denied that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked." 
The company complaint against the driver of the lorry. 
For the compensation to the family of the girl, the agency will not wait until the judgment of the court, but with regard to the financial compensation, also on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in order 
A change in the law, which is being drawn up, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts of the transport ministry, could provide details about the movement of stewards aboard the bus. 
"Well, it has not led to any conclusion on this point. 
In fact, it is not too buses, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones at the wheel, "said the expert Hořín. 
"The transport ministry does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," said the spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of the security of coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work. 
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words have plenty in the letter by the Committee director of WestLB to employees of the house. 
In a union of the financial institute in Duesseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday. 
The WestLB would "block of competence" doubled a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive Mogadishu-based to other mergers in the banking sector Länder. 
That is what it looks like when a committee Executive Board is to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
For WestLB, injured, is still a strong pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority Surveillance of Services Financiers who has only recently, made it clear to the government of the province of Rhenanie of the Nord-Westfalie that time is running out in the search for a solution. 
It is a question for a long time, the side of Frankfurt, a relationship of a form between the Deka bank, which is the clients of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and WestLB. 
Of course, head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas said at the presentation of the figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that this is the Helaba or WestLB. 
But the board of directors of the Deka, which every half is borne by the banks of the Länder and by groups of savings funds, has asked the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB to commercial activities. 
It could be the flow of financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks come, however, is to begin in the financial market. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidation in the sector of savings funds. 
In 2003 we thought for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with Bank of Land North Palatinate and the Halbab. 
Nothing is evident from this ternaire mix. 
In the plans had they been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse said it was against any participation of the Hellaba in them. 
Subsequently, the other two houses not to rejoignèrent. 
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Land of the bank Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there was always new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with the Länder banks. 
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, however, was pronounced against any trade strategy of merger with its bank. 
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spread that the amalgamation of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election to the House of the Land of Bavaria, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could be implemented in the first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If pressure to new mergers should increase the potential escape him. 
In the South, it will be a junior partner, although it has far better resisted the crisis that banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The group of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which has 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has drawn a barrel at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB. 
We would then have applied to the NordLB. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques does, however, that one of the facets. 
Another aspect is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the key issue, namely through which model commercial viability of the Länder banks should be guaranteed, had not previously resolved by the German association of savings banks and transfers. 
In the long run, a carve-up of the WestLb could take place, carving here which is obviously not wanted. 
It is also what the letter of the Committee Executive Board in place: in any case, would be targeted a comprehensive solution 'to the establishment. 
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the beer is also known as the Italian two-league. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as then-girlfriend and, therefore, nothing is the same, he said.

The Munich police is strengthened by seven policemen of the South Tirol of Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which is a sfatistics on the country where the Italian occupies first place in the British (60 speeches) and Austria (80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
That is particularly appreciated by Italian, it is the attempts of the Hofbräu. 
Arabian Nights of sleep for Hypo Real Estate shareholders 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Finance Minister just a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician had used the word 'relatively' and he dragged that German banker would not be affected by the crisis. 
It is indeed occurred this weekend. 
The financial Hypo Real Estate Bavarian home (HRE), the DAX gets to a consortium of German banks a credit of a billion to protect itself from turbulence in the markets. 
One person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are granted up to an amount of EUR 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay the interest on the part on what it would be right. 
The money comes from private banks as that of public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa which bears the losses. 
The financial state, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed the money - which is no longer possible since the fact of distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the liquidity reserve of the bank had been reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, the rate of capital also had slightly declined 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The benefits in net and those from financial transactions were, compared with the same period last year, fell to 97-0, the profits from the allocation of debts and certain securities and the termination of provisions in the credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros. 
And it is only through the important benefits the reimbursement of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the interest payments, according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies that the deficit Konzern gains of around 16 percent has been moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state had badly speculated on industrial appropriations, which then had been filialisés to the Aareal bank. 
Because the financing of classic state was not quite profitable, the Depfa then committed more closely in the infrastructure projects and the funding of joint projects between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the Hypo Real Estate, the société-fille must make depreciations which should have on calculating gains and losses of a material that is quite vague. 
The fact is that the dividends have been cut. 
For 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate, since the takeover of the Depfa, an investor of infrastructure and highly important. 
It is more robust than other institutes of the refinancing dependent on the inter-bancaire market since it has no Al-Taji customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks is new considerably dried up, the banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a – about 50 Milliards euros - all the appropriations Depfa a means for short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement of the Hypo Real Estate, the need to finance the group is covered with the credit in the medium term, and the company protected influence of financial international markets largely out of action. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be assured through the funds until the end of 2009. 
The Chairman of the Committee Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Services Financiers (Bafin) based on the principle that the ability of the Hypo Real on the market is now guaranteed. 
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have to hope. 
However, in view of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not unthinkable that we should not use the funding in all its breadth. 
But the opposite cannot be ruled out. 
After the fact that the bank, following the recent statements, the doors of insolvency Sunday evening, this baord to the provisional less will not reassure the minds. 
The share price slumped 75 percent to 3,30 euros. 
The obligations, however, are particularly well. 
While the debts to have barely budged, loans to sway. 
The most affected are especially investment funds of the old société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those of course which have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate appeared before a placement alternative speculation, their value should be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who took the crisis in the establishment by the acquisition of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the institutions, the governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or will hope that nobody in this moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But the noise renouvellés a partial nationalization, the likelihood that appproaching the sureté is now a mere expectation. 
This should reserve nights of sleep before all creditors in the long term on the decision of whether they should be separate from their commitments. 
The short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement of the losses for the next few years on the next tax on the income of the capital stock gains automatically. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the wobble to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, must be present for the first day to the Highschool of Tachibana, girls begin to giggle laugh: German is so "kawaii". 
What est-ce-que it means? 
Sylvana is already this word thanks to the Mangas – in his new Log exchanges, it speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of the Japan. 
What est-ce-que I was excited. 
Even the way to go to school, I was afraid. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I find the path, and fortunately I am not lost. 
The beginning of course does not seem to be set so strict that home in Lower Saxony. 
The students are one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours least 20, a round table discussion begins with the teacher, the "home room.". 
But before the course starts, it was up to me to present. 
I am not the kind like to speak to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils. 
As I had not yet the school uniform, I have put an old skirt of my mother, and a shirt, blue ankle socks and black leather shoes. 
In this place, I am before the Chair, and have tried everything: pronounce properly Sayonara Wo she Sylvana … - I am Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At this time, I was very pleased to have started to learn the language there two years ago. 
The 31 girls in the class have all been whispering, pouffé laugh and signs, and I have repeatedly heard the word "Kawaii.". 
I already knew thanks to my manga. 
It is the essential to the survival of the Japanese teens and means "nice, cute.". 
I am quickly slipped to my place. 
The girl next to me gave me a great smile ironic, it found that it was an honour that the should sit alongside it. 
The rest of the time has been quite calm, but when the bell has spoken, I have been attacked in the rules. 
Everyone spoke at pouffait, laugh and I had a lot of questions, in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, they have all left their Bento. 
My host mother had also been this kind of Lunchbox - this is really something other than the meagre snacks. 
I had the rice to the aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a strange taste and a completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Well, except perhaps the plums salted preserved, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in schools. 
It sometimes happens that a daughter offers a boy a Bento she has prepared itself, which is then prepared very carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my manga. 
I am curious to know if I could observe here too. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I have said that I wanted to spend a year at the school in Tokyo. 
I have always said: 
"Because it fascinates me," 
In the end, read manga, that is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the manga and culture which is, at a time, I have also begun to learn the Japanese. 
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I also have a low for the customs, traditions and customs. 
And here, it gives them a lot of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technologies and the latest trends, on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organised, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen. " 
The rats also have sensations 
A rat or a cockroach fled to the danger, est-ce-que it means that it is also the fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how to check that it have the same thing when it behaves in the same way that we? 
In the online magazine Edge "," contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think be true without proof of it?" 
I believe that the animals have feelings and other states without any that I or anyone else has until now been able to prove as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all the human brain have the same situation. 
As soon as we look to other species and that we are dealing with the issues of felt or general awareness, we are moving in difficult terrain because the Hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
The human beings behave the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a subjective. 
However, I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience to the animals. 
One of the aspects is that almost always associated circuits to the human conscience include the Cortex (of the prefrontal side of its participation in the memory in the short term and in the direction and implementation). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in others. 
All the less so for the aspects-ci of our conscience who depend on the Cortex, including the prefrontal aware of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs from the other primates. 
Another significant feature might lie in the nature of: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, it often means that its conscience depends on it. 
In this case, it could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, the Commission certainly influence, so that the animal awareness, regardless of how it is produced would differ, probably a lot of most of our states of conscience. 
That is why it is so difficult to determine what can be the conscience among other animals. 
If this internal and subjective, does not measure, or the fact of this particular Hardware, analyse based on our own experience, his comment raises serious problems. 
Most of my developments make reference to the content of the experienced aware, but there are also another aspect of conscience who should be more easily accessible. 
We could examine the process of awareness of the animals without taking account of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the nerve correlations aware on the mechanisms causals: the two may be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the implementation of the display. 
But what résulte-t-il for the emotions? 
I concluded that a system emotions such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activities. 
What we designate as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reactions of the body) monopolises the memory alive. 
Thus, the emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterise the primates and human rights. 
In subtle degrees of felt, associated with our nature volubile, can be seen, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorize the blame for the other to us. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believe that the sensations from primitive activities in the regions of the feeling of the Cortex body and the brain stem, as Jaak Pankseep which focuses more on the brain. 
As this network is not much changed during the human development, it could actually part of horizontal sensations in any kind. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict him, but I believe that to prove. 
Pankseep asserts that what is as fear among people and in rats is probably also felt as such in the two cases: how yet whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave in similar way? 
A cockroach fled to the danger, but if he felt fear? 
In my view, similar behaviour are not enough to prove experienced the same. 
Of course, the comparison nervous help: rats and men have similar brain chopped-down, the rats by against do not have a brain. 
But est-ce-que the brain is the source of the sensations? 
And even if we could prove it to: how the show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps the rats (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I do not know how the show. 
And because their feelings to differentiate probably completely of ours (since the human conscience is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour emotional feelings that the rats. 
In all cases, progress break on the nervous as we measure the same thing in rats and human rights. 
As I is not exploring the language and the conscience in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We could see this as the in the short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly beat me against a wall. 
I am a pragmatic émotionel. 
Michel Platini, president of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The Deputy Prime Minister Wasjunik out said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister. 
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in the Ukraine and its ability to organize, in cooperation with Poland, the European Championship," Wasjunik said. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work has just begun, and there is still much to do in the two countries. " 
In the timetable for the construction or the destruction of the stadium, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines. 
The number of stages for the championship of Europe might be reduced from eight to six. 
"We cannot afford to lose more time. 
We must work to the maximum speed, "said the President of the Ukraine-style League Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA has constantly to the eye.". 
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland. 
The direction of the League of Polish football association has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The committee met on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It is "a real danger that the association would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of Polish news agency PAP. 
"We have said in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship do not suffer." 
Several members of the League of First Division were already in the previous season, sentenced to compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the beginning of the League has even been moved at the last minute. 
Dennis Quaid outraged counter-attack 
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, spoke of his private life in an interview with – and now has problems with his former: the Republican actor-turned-politician Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on his former adultérin Dennis Quaid. 
It foam – and counter-attack. 
A war of the late Rose to the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disgracieuse battle in the – of the world. 
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview to the newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis was infidel for a long time, and it was very painful." 
It would be aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce. 
The reason for this lies in a striptease of press relations of Ryan for his new film "The Women," told the story of adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on its qualification of unfaithful husband fell clearly: this would be "Monstrueux," said to the New York Daily News, 54 years, "Meg chews again once again the history of our relationship and the handle.". 
This would be "regrettable," and that "the changes that have a divorce for every child again rekindled in public" for their son of 16 years Jack. " 
While Ryan lives only since the divorce, Quaid remarried and will soon become the father of twins. 
So was his response to the label: "In any case, my life continues. 
I am happy to have a wonderful family who is the better. ". 
The price of tickets and hotels fall 
In the first half of 2008, the flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a study, the flights would be even reduced to 50 percent. 
The flights and hotel nights would again become advantageous - this is the result of a study of the provider of financial services and travel American Express. 
The company has analysed the data of bookings in the first half of 2008 and has established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp fall in profits in the second quarter. 
After the market price of hotels have increased over the years, the nights of hotels have already reduced in many places. 
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of 48 European cities examined still 6.9 percent on average in comparison with 2007 in 41 of 48 European cities examined. 
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year. 
The trend has been clear to Paris and Rome, where the passengers were paid 30 to 37 percent a year earlier. 
The causes of this résideraient for American Express in the weak dollar which has led to a "desire to travel in reduction of American tourists.". 
The financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that the industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish town, the price of hotels are with an increase of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe. 
So in terms of the price of flights, the trend was the increase in the first quarter. 
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, the passengers in economy class have pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the long-haul flights, very consumers of fuel, have risen to 29.2 percent. 
From April to June, the economy class ticket prices have fallen by an average of 12.5 percent compared with the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price changes have been far less. 
In Germany, prices have been falling even more important than in other European countries: 
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they fell 23.6 percent. 
The German domestic flights have been divided by two according to the study. 
The reasons for this fall in prices would be an economic growth slowing, the company said. 
The request exclusivist ground in a market segment of travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is a pressure intensified competition by the Treaty "open skies" which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
In a sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines non-rentables routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have put the death toll during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe. 
HSV bt Gladbach 1 0 
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has not yet managed to find a eleven functional. 
In Kristoffer Klein. Agrandir. Atterrissage in disaster for international player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbach player not returned late in the game and its firing lifted failed against the framework of the goal. 
His message was made, it was out of his lips so persuasive. 
He knew that he was right. 
"We need this second goal," Rieger Hermann booed in the corridor of the lockerroom of the arena of Hamburg. 
There was little in the lockerroom, the half was over, and most were put back in their place. 
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he has a great reputation as many former players. 
And that is why its request has been received to strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Zhol has acquiesé and lifted the inch to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the entraineur to Hamburg Martin Zhol. 
Point the orders appear to have been similar, and it blows with the second goal. 
The implementation has failed. 
"Everything was not very nice to see today," admitted later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would have "wished to be more relaxed.". 
The 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg must strike a successful head Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very low Gladbach players could not do harm to the small players in Hamburg. 
"It has been a dirty victory," said Marin Zhol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans are celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the paintings of ranking on the giant screen that showed their club as the first of the class. 
It will be an anniversary without genuine celebration. 
"We know take back," said Marcell Jansen. 
It is clear that the outcome of the picture reflects the unpredictable nature of the first League that the domination of its HSV. 
The team with its arrivals late committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as Jansen discharged of FC Bayern – certainly is slowly, but it is not yet. 
"We need more than charm and dribble," demanded Zhol.

In the dark matter influence the flight of the space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the confusion: the dark matter influence the speed of space probes for so-called manoeuvring gravitationnel support. 
Experts fear that the theory of relativity is not completely correct. 
For nearly 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in space. 
Because of conductions fuel soon frozen, cryogen the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause confusion among researchers - the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
The gravitationnel support is a ploy of space probes, by which they get further impetus in the field gravitationnel a heavenly body, the earth, for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Cassini-Huygens Cassini-Huygens américo-européenne research used this trick, as the Ulysses solar probe. 
That is what surprised the researchers for years: bronzeware wheels are not always 100 percent of the way in which we have according to the respective laws of gravitation. 
Of more irregularities are the speed. 
The probes unexpectedly become faster or more slowly. 
Until now, the physicists could not explain this. 
They baptised the anomaly of the support gravitationnel. 
Some experts feared that the theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, who described the force of attraction of the area because of the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct. 
The US physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as that Einstein chose and try to explain the anomaly of the gravitationnel support to the aid of the so-called black on that astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"The black on could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he said. 
The researchers of the area are aware of the black only for about ten years. 
It is apparently it a force of attraction whose effect is seen on other celestial bodies. 
It is completely invisible, i.e. that it sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no light visible. 
According to the calculations of the scientific black, would be a good fifth of the total mass of the universe. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released and that the Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed the Italian.

The five Germans, five Italians and the Romanian and eight Egyptian guides are doing well and are safe, national television announced. 
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be en route to Cairo. 
The circumstances surrounding a shootout before the release of the hostages are still unclear, and the kidnappers would have been to put an end to the kidnapping, in the words of a security guard, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without cyring station. 
"The problem was solved. 
They agreed with a ransom, "said the agent. 
It remained to collect the hostages, "when suddenly," this "occurred. 
The Sudanese soldiers had shot Sunday six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.

Abus a father-in-law "which led to the suicide" 
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law led a woman to suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, Stithians, in Cornwall, has been jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent facts routes. 
The high court of Truro has referred it regularly tied his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death.". 
The court has been informed that Melle Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had committed and bandaged before the force to sexual acts, while his mother worked at the local pub. 
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s, and it turned live in Cornwall. 
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth. 
But the court has been informed that Melle Randle, assiduous of National Trust, was full of abuses that had been imposed twice a week. 
The attorney general, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had said that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and, since 2006 was "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life." 
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.

"I have not abused her sexually. 
"I feel responsible for his death." 
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are bizarre as fetishist, your victim should certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7 years. 
"This saga which ended with the suicide of the victim. 
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if it had committed this gesture, its history would certainly never over the court. ". 
It added: "I would describe as his father and his mother, the effects of your crime made for years on Stephanie. 
"Without them, it would undoubtedly be a happy young woman, promising, and success." 
Condemnation for loss of data. 
The ministerial officer of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten the top secret documents on a train in June, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, has been able to the BBC. 
The man of the Ministry of Defence was when he left behind two highly classified documents on a train at Waterloo. 
The documents are in the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
That is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent. 
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner said that the episode had many people of Whitehall. 
"They have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said. 
The employee who cannot be named, is accused of breach of section 8.1 of the act, in other words, the clause which deals with the protection of information. 
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the sensitive nature of his work in the Committee Together of Secrets Services 
The documents that he has lost contained assessments on Al Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq. 
He has been informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then taken home to a secret location. 
Local of the building facing the bill B & B. 
The British companies of the building may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank. 
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of savers income 2.6 million of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interest of the loan will be paid by all the companies that collect money from savers, including 59 companies from the building. 
The director general of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian building has said that he is "irritating" that the companies and their members will have to pay the bill … 
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys will be available. 
But the interests that are at the same time increase, will be sold, every year, to 700 financial companies who collect deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have been a wise … must now pay some bills institutions that were much less cautious. 
Adrian building, BSA 
It proclaims that every society must pay a deposit proportional to the amount that it has, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will in 2009, to £450millions. 
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian building, director general of the trade committee of companies from the building, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair. 
"It is irritating" to see that the institutions that have been a wise at the resumption of the real estate market, must now pay for the institutions much less cautious. 
According to the BSA, there is no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first record. 
"We need to look at all aspects of this issue during the next few weeks, to assess the options to prevent the companies from the building and their members pay the hefty bill," said Mr Cole. 
The interests for 2009 cover seven months, the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, there will have to pay the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Given that companies of the building are organisations without shareholder, their member end up paying the bill either by higher costs, or lower interest rates for savings accounts.

A ex-Pm of Bangladesh was refused bail 
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who risk to be arrested upon his return to the country. 
His lawyers have said that the court has refused to give his bail because of his indictment for having extorted a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000,00) when it was MP. 
The case is one of many accusations that are addressed. 
Khaleda Zia, a rival of Sheikh Hasina, has been released on bail earlier this month. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh by a few weeks ago, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the interim military government of the country gives him his first full freedom. 
The correspondents have said that the terms of his release are contradictory because if we allow him to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could not remain free to his return to Bangladesh. 
His lawyers have said that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court has rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina saying that it does not require bail since it was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq. 
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court" 
His lawyers have argued that it needs this bail to return the country to prepare for the elections in December 
Sheikh Hasina should return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami party. 
It was detained last year after the military interim government has assumed power, but was released in June for care abroad. 
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations which they are subject. 
Inquiétudes to the antipolio Afghan campaign. 
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent campaign of immunization against polio, owing to the violence linked to the Taliban, said the UN. 
The UN has carried out last week, a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.

BSkyB is losing the battle in ITV 
BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would have to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmitter. 
The Court of Appeal Competition has ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of the ITV of 17.9% less than 7.5%. 
The committee has said that in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented the competition and allowed it to influence unfairly ITV. 
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, which buys ITV. 
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair Trading has reported that the purchase by BSkyB shares of ITV has planted the seeds of doubt on the effective independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate 
The Virgin boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to the purchase. 
BSkyB said that the force to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and instead was excessive – particularly given that BSkyB has just given up its voting rights. 
New investigation in the case of the US prosecutors. 
The attorney general has appointed a special accuser to check the question of the dismissal of nine US prosecutors in 2006. 
The Palestinian-born is the account of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which criticised the actions of some officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and former attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal of political causes. 
The accuser, Nora Dannehy Iraq now will investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation, lied to the investigators, blocking and justice. 
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, not based, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said the Inspecteur General, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to table, was one of its major recommendations. 
The dispute begins by radiation in December 2006 of nine US prosecutors made by the US Justice Department. 
At the time, the department said that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance. 
But it emerged then that prosecutors dismissed were not more criticism that their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these redundancies a political connotation. 
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate the charges of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
The US prosecutors investigate and the judicial authorities for the government. 
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, the Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, is accused of being involved in the case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned. 
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice have also given their resignation. 
The report of the Inspecteur General was very critical of Gonzales' role in this matter, saying he was "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and ultimately "abidicate 'leadership role," succeeding remarkably not involved in this matter. 
Other ministerial officers, including former aide to Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticised for failing to cooperate in the investigation.

In about 30 feet wide to 120, it looks like a dusty gone rather than an artery. 
. Aucuns signs from the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard. 
The street, however, has admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street. 
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a more fluid to the stores and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including neighbours, said to be charmed by this shortened simply because it is one of the last and oldest streets of block of houses. 
But the Department of Immobilier Preservation and Development of the town which manages the street, has no interest in the bear. 
This month, at a meeting of the committees of owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal allowing the company to buy the house. 
But the committee would prefer that the street is still in the hands of the city, and called for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the manager of the Committee No 3. 
"There are few areas belonging to the city, and we hope that the city retains Extra Place," she said. 
"They could propose to rehabilitate and manage, as Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a cafe that the manufacturer will concede space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner. 
"the main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this been abandoned, and make public," she said, adding that this was the city to suggest the sale. ". 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell well the street, stressing that the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than manage it. 
Compared to its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight mark. 
Some believe that Extra Place is the name since 1802, when the heritage of the great of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving Tiomin this small, which remained since abandoned. 
The entry after the legendary CBGB a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has re open to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the picture album of coverage of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia" 
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scraps, ragged barrels, posters, leaves and Celermajer. " 
Some residents, including the bloggers who had already talked about the evolution of the luxury of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should be public. 
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be done in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called Jeremiah' Vanishing if New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations stuff: A Amèrement Nostalgique on A City in the process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac dark day and night, and defined by the doors of a warehouse and rusted iron shutters, full of newspapers last week which are along the gutters." 
A few exceptions, the street has always the same. 
A rat short nimbly at the bottom of the alleyway near a door which was once the legendary CBGB and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer 22 ounces empty, based in Tiomin newspapers that have just been cast. 
Some people said they did not think that rarely to Extra Place, and suggested its value. 
Mr Field, his hand, said that he thought some under felt the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "are held in dark places, damp and disgusting.". 
The Debate Bilingue Immersion in the English language: 
In this part of the programme supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and former director of the department of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Well that You Pensiez do. Why the middle class should be able to choose their school." 
Drawing the Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr Obama stresses that "the African-American and Latino students have less chance of diplômer that the white students." It is true. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports in particular among so many other issues, "the transitional bilingual education" for those learning English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education class defends the investigation into languages other than English, is also its interest to eliminate the differences. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of told of Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many new arrivals, the English. 
Among the students of CM1, 100% have passed the examination of State of maths, 2008. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of anglais-de langues-d' arts 
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient as put forward by Mr Obama. 
Sixth Street on analyses, practice, ongoing evaluation capacities and an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, Linda Mikels, Sixth Street, the school has established the investigation of the English language "full immersion.". 
The total immersion in English language focus on the almost constant use of English in the investigation. 
Melle Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education has affirmed "we have had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you go without his class, you would have had no chance to identify." 
"This march," it has other market for us " 
Mr Obama should not take the Sixth Street Prep and respond in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves, but the policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations for support for a long time the bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, confuse the forecasts of the response from Mr Obama. 
Although it is in favour immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
"On the contrary, he said," you must assure you that your child speaks Spanish. ". 
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than scorn or as insignificant. 
Oil Nette Fall newsagency following the Inquiétudes of the world economy 
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for the financial marches, will be able to breathe new life into the economy.

At the same time, the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg governments have party YPFB, Fortis, European financial conglomerate.

"We believe that the raw materials they cannot escape from this infection. 
"With regard to the raw materials, our most pressing concerns is that to understand where the virus RC-135S overall and diffuserait-il in particular, in China.".

The celebration of the Second Temps What matters now for the Improvement of Record of sports daily L'Equipe. 
After spending during the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform of the Jets Shaun Ellis, thought he had seen everything. 
It was the second time, when the Jets transformed a 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have bloody played under dark clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a pass to Laveranues building 12 yards for a touchdown, sign a after noon during their relationship has made a leap forward. 
Favre has been building for two other touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds of the half. 
"I am not out of my area" Favre said about all its passes to building. 
"It is a" poor player 
"We communicate extremely well, despite what the people say." 
While Favre playing building and using, the defence was the quarter back the Cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Revis, corner back, has intercepted a firing lost 32 yards and the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another passes and was intercepted. 
Linebacker David Bowens left escape the ball because of WMG. 
The last change, the loss of the ball of Bowens, could well be the most charming 
The Cardinals took control of the possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets have recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best that the Jets could mark at a time. 
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who were asked to describe this madness," said the second or third time? " 
When we told him the deux- the Jets have lost 21 points in the third temps- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third. 
. "Many points were scored in a short space of time.". 
Gebrselassie rested, beyond his world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has once again proved to be worthy of the title of best rider of the century, after his own world record in the marathon in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 accommodating a race on the flat, Gebrselassie has broken 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, 5.7km last year in Berlin. 
In 35 years ago, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, the 1600mètres of the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution is increasing its problems of asthma. 
On the contrary, it promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost parfaites- time sunny, 48 degrees at the start, the arrivée- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The riders of runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all Kenyans, converted into two runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa reached in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters have suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before, and have missed training for a week. 
It is clear that the rest of remained bright, but not rusted. 
"I am so happy," he told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I am handed over the last week and today, I had my doubts, but in the end, everything is gone for the better. " 
It was reproché- especially in Kenya, the rival is the Ethiopie- of having too orchestrate trips, avoiding the marathon world stars, relying on the hares as if they were in a competition of track, and the more world records that the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not reduce the magnitude of the capabilities of Gebrselassie as a rider. 
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to me. 
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the heads of have disappeared. 
In a little more than three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie made its final push to dispose of Kwambai, who finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving the best record of five minutes. 
Kamathis is is third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
The last spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, has surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
It could take part in the games in Beijing because of a hypothetical badly in the back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving his third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It ran making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners take a good advantage, then more than about 18miles ½ after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, ecologist, finished third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a City to Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Life 
Cache in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a small town tin-pot where are the pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, the first black fully city, home of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that it did in 1935, is no longer so easy to make our days." The city in the five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 skin darkened, 300 good swimmers, guavas, two schools and not in prison. ". 
It has now become a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival held each year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in different ways, the city that it décrit- tourism has become, thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place. 
It is also worthy, independent private, and that it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share his real thoughts with the white man, "we with so little, do not know what it is.". 
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious with abroad. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident since always and former paroissienne of the city. 
"it must be in line with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It is both a historical 33-year-old a black power and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of sudiste- black rural culture once scorned, others acclamée- reminiscent of the birth of slavery. 
This would explain why the residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston. 
It presented its home city in the world through books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed this city, located just outside of Route 17, a road which runs through the center of the Florida, often forgotten that in chapter in the history and the human tragedy. 
Audacieuse such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and play areas well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care, although he can barely read and write. 
It also made reference to the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and that everything that can serve the people. 
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville car to a government but also to the analphabétisation, remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not as well. 
It was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciated. 
Zora has described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Hurston was immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who rented their beauty." 
It added: "some people have not appreciated.". 
We remember always Hurston as a person and eccentric, which was frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston was usual in a city without warning, in a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional dress. 
Many residents were fascinated, Franklin said, when people made fun of it. 
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said. 
But he also said, rocked in his chair of the patio posterior which gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly entitled, "it was never too long.". 
On the death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out of production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College in the 1920s, it was buried in a grave, to Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
In Eatonville, no great celebration, or plate for the general public. 
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy that it offered in the world, "said Valerie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Officials of Orange County wanted to build a motorway to five routes in the city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, two-lane main street of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 until the west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville healed just a difficult period of its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mix of races led the hate the doors of the community. 
"then, young whites were launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin. 
"a woman is dead." 
They threw a watermelon of their car. ". 
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Supreme Court to a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race.". 
The residents claim now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence of young people. 
"black children used to be embrassés- I remember pursuits we embraced our master the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins director and head of the Sauvegarde of the Community of Eatonville, a group not profit. 
This has long, ajouta-t-elle until the teachers and students came more of the same place. 
"You do not embrace tone White professor because it is blanc- I want to say that there is a line," said Melle Nathiri. 
The civil rights, moreover, have helped to create space for other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went in addition to the damage, as it, armed with a cheerful confidence own and lines of action such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company." 
It is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker visited the grave anonymous Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography cheered on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best saddle, reintroduced the guns. 
The draft of the motorway arrived just when the daughter the most notorious Eatonville had found its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Hurston regard it as a saviour. 
The community has started to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans came at the opening of the festival after two years, and many in January, for the mark. 
After many years, told rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the highway to five ways, very fast, a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri. 
Melle Boyd said the "Zora Eatonville has saved.". 
The victory against the project of the highway has enabled him to change its own image. 
People not residents, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attends our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library mono subject (renamed obviously Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved. 
Today, Eatonville is an anomaly for Florida: six miles to Orlando, it can at any time is seen as a back street after a rainy day in summer, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(now has 90 percent of blacks) 
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its right to be, are still treated with caution. 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of the Old Church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating the black men in the champs- must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Melle Jones, a teacher courageous and which has a low for the red, are still afraid that their island community is well understood. 
However, given the expansion of Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
The young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, hard worker, crazy, mixed that other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is the sincere civic affection that we in the voice of the nephew of Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional forces. 
And even for the most young people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description. 
"Most of the people, who are in this area, will think: 'Oh, this city has nothing compared to other" Alondra Kenon said after the mass on Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very beautiful city. ". 
Here in New York, all speak fluent in finance. 
Despite all, nothing has changed. 
If the tourists in Manhattan were far from the kiosk and giant television screens in Times Square, they do not make that they are in the eye of the storm. 
Never before they could not believe that in the offices in glass and nest of bee over their sucks, bankers and managers of hedge funds which monopolise New York, the worst "working day at the office" since the fall of 1929. 
The deliverymen continue to tack on the pavements, with their carriages and their plates of muffins for the matinières meetings. 
The is Latino are always between the residential buildings, as mules, 50 shirts luxurious hanged a yoke prepared on his shoulders. 
The office still queuing to buy their sandwich matinier itinerant traders, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h in the week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account. 
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, as I discovered to my local JP Morgan Chase, 20 people queuing. 
Not before the wickets of cashiers, or to pull out of the species or make a payment, but before the wicket of customer service, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists were the direction for the store H. Macy, and new customers opened accounts. 
Most of those in front of me, I apprendrais later Starr, my "personal banker," were all in line for the same reason. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts so-called thrifts (such a), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries which only work in a state, and who say deal with customers and their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt. 
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 has used the president of backruptcy, and while the New Yorkers returned to the house for the week ending on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts with a value of $440 million, désespéramment sought a buyer for the save. 
The office and the employees of shops in front of me, who are afraid of potential another debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to be reliable, is that most baord to Wall Street. 
Some New Yorkers any have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a lady to my local supermarket, talk on the telephone from Lehman Brothers, the bank that has gone bankrupt, and its meager director Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could have to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, the receptionist in uniform in my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or delivery of my merchant of fruit and vegetables. 
She said to me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take risks.". 
Muslim Tombes desecrated while Austria swing to the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the cities against the "Islamisation" to Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008. 
They are road signs of mosques striped in red. 
Police accused the right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery, the week end the victory of political parties of the extreme right wing in the general elections of the country. 
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning, according to the police for action. 
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives to believe that this could be done to disguise the feeling of self-hatred extremists to the Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could be in some way linked to the elections. 
A spokesman of the Islamic local Community said he was "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which comes just religious during the holy month of Ramadan which is coming to an end. 
Austria think seriously to find his courage, following his variation to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two right-wing parties which swept almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti- immigration. Some of their slogans were considered, according to the criticism, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the votes, has led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the alaha food. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of Islam to Austria and Europe. 
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.

The magistrates have imposed on Glitter expelling six months, after it has expressed to the authorities who have under control, its intention to go to Spain via France. 
Police in Kent had given this travel ban last Thursday after the magistrates have proved the guilt of Glitter for sexual abuse on children.

. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after having served 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for assaulting two girls, respectively, of 10 and 11 years. 
When it was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok where he would have the board for a flight to London.

Incluse in the programming of the Month of the Photographie Fleming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," said the designer, explaining that "Flamenco - people" can be anybody but, having seen the pictures, the observer realise that this is not the typical images of artists. 
These people photographed "in the street" artists are able to transmit on stage of the passion, the sadness, joy... exciting the public. 
To capture moments of personality of these artists must not make pictures on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere which allows me to capture with the camera moments of flamenco stars personality. ". 
With the festival groundbreaking "Song of the Mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to photograph the singers, guitarists or the dancers with a camera to mark. 
These are pictures that, thanks to the choice of camera and hardware, reminds the photograph. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the side of the traditional image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco Bauer said: "A very traditional music with roots which is surprising and every day.". 
It is not the dance or the song in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivate the public with its art. 
The search for the essential and magic has been the constant in this work is presented these days to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The flamenco stars as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about 70 artists photographed. 
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for portraits of Bauer has led to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco – people," the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of the people, to know and be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the kind the more difficult. 
Do you find in front of people, people that sometimes you do not know or are you just a few minutes to make a photograph. 
Despite these circumstances, as photographer, I always try my ideas reality. ". 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco – people," is exposed to the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the number 20 of the streets of the Mata (road parallel to the Peupleraie of Hercules) which will be open until October 16.

The novelist Spanish-American acknowledged there was "no way" to measure and whether the books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a short-lived experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has" and "makes people less similar," because it has asked the writers "not to give in to the frivolity" and take their vocation.

"Sangre Mayo ', dared to Garci 
In inspired by the stories of Benito Perez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci récrée the famous battle of Spaniards against the French in "Sangre of mayo ', which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost EUR 15 million budget.

Isabelle Bayón is in the skin of the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay tribute to a dancer sévillane also. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, the daughter of a father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a mother of Andalusia (shooting Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana and at the age of three years will go live in London with his family. 
It was a dancer free dance and professor of oriental dances. 
It was an exciting life, pioneer of the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of the woman who marked the history of dance interwar in Europe, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and it has proposed to interpret the dancer sévillane Tórtola Valencia and this has been incredible.". 
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking. 
The titles of his dances have to flamenco. 
"Thus, the dance of the butterfly" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance the dance of the snake "and" some tangos. 
His dance was sensuous and they told me that my way to dance was identical to hers, "she said. 
The scenario has been through two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of its shows, as he had done to "The puerta"; and abierta of Professor Matilde Coral, which has exceptionally well wanted to cooperate with the one that was his. 
"Matilde Tórtola into a mature figure. 
I am happy because it has agreed to play a role in my work, and it honors. ". 
The staging is done through music composition and guitars of Jesús Torres is Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga there I of Morón; piercing of El Pájaro, as well as the violates Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered prima donnas.". 
This implementation also said, in a way, the life of the woman who has displayed in places so distant, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or in Russia, but also in the whole of Europe, since it was usually in London. 
"I wanted to remind the because I believe that these are women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and highlights his work," said Bayón. 
The show will start at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope of Vega 
The publication of the "Journal of a poet Triennat the recently married." 
The presentation of the first edition of the Journal of sheafs Poète a recently married "in the Stephen' Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married with Zenobia in March, is part of the activities envisaged by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the" Zenobia Triennat and Juan Ramón "(2006-2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for literature and their deaths. 
In this way, "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the revival of the play, with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and the roving exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar light" which was inaugurated in May last year and who, having travelled in the various provinces of Andalusia, will go to New York at the International.

America very fond less without Paul Newman 
"Some time God creates perfect people 
Paul Newman was part. ". 
This sentence is actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "A lack of mischief," and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is not of this world. 
He had trouble getting an Oscar 
It is more since 2007. 
Everyone knew he was ill. 
This has been a hard blow for all the world. 
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were best thanks to its existence.". 
Nobody was afraid to go to ridiculous or to exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly unclear, where the terrorists and the stock markets are afraid, low of US fell, desperately searching for reasons of dignity. 
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is the human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman. 
It was for all the world an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has had trouble against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attention or the nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that no James Bond died before him. 
Another English, whom the Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"It has set the bar high," George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one who is trying to break the screen like Paul Newman: is very honnêt and with a serious privacy and objectives. 
This is not always easy or possible in the jungle of our days. 
But there is that which is trying, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, he has been married 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who has been true even if the opportunities it plenty not to be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a steak in my fridge?," he used to joke. 
In the sky, it is with pride to the meeting of his daughters with its fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
"Of all the great roles he has interpreted, it has never been so proud that the devoted husband, father, grandfather of loving and philanthropist," must. 
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid to hold the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it might be in 2016. 
But I wonder whether we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race: we are not. 
They call it the perfect race, but I believe it was the worst race that I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would be subject to a preliminary heat. 
But look at all in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes begin with the withdrawal of numbers, which requires you to go ahead. 
This is not bad, but if they are you move it would be better that they give you all (including the electronic chip for the races). 
Well not 
They were you go there only to take the number (first mistake, travel only for it) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that the size 'If for the (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
In what kind of world are we? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis that they decided to buy the shirts of small tissue with less and less ladies? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the races.. 
Apart from the fact that we have to go very early to withdraw the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and he must leave his backpack at the entrance. 
It has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 10,880 people are expected to these races.. 
Since there is a long queue, competitions have begun, and we had left our backpack, although once the withdrawal has been worse. 
Moreover, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which have taken place and the attacks of the barn. 
I believe that some 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, do not even will appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me, which I think has not been properly. 
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of perfect race, it would certainly not to the idea. 
I believe that we can still dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.. 
Microsoft seeks a receptionist (virtual) 
At the conference on the MIT Technology Émergentes Microsoft has been presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a sort of Intelligence Artificielle with little intelligence but able to make some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move in the campus of the company) in response to what we asked him during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, "the receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, which they are - including remember what positions they occupy, and listen to and hear the words keys to their conversations. 
But the group groups conversation 
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that it is not the group which is trying to talk with it and that it is not part of the company. 
She asked whether she is here to visit someone and it said that it will respond in a few moments. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressionnant. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we have spoken in more than a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter, and it will not all associated programmes. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would five times faster. 
This is a discovery since Microsoft version after version, has repeatedly said the functions and "perks" to Windows. 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft has reason, its operational system loses importance but also its software. 
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the hardware and the software to understand. 
It is the same as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the system operational not as an absolute truth but as a truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
The people are less and less attention to the operational system but increasingly to the Internet browser. 
We turn on the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than to go windows. 
A half the applications are provided with the system? 
Who can more can the least. 
And Windows 7 will contain less applications, much less than Vista. 
Less, busy months, less complex. 
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own on-line services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need it, in fact, and I shows you an example. 
The photograph in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in the rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster their request to use their own research tool, "Ta research. Our future.". 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009, but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010. 
Microsoft will certainly launch at the same time Windows 7.0 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, more and more like a computer. 
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear. 
The Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was in a Diamant in the blood of Edward Zwick, Al Pacino in "The Godfather 'from Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the gay association of heavy-handed. 
And if we are to list all his appearances, we could also mention this strapping man moustachu who raised the weight in a travelling circus. 
It is not just a simple jersey in male body in cotton, hugging and without sleeves. 
The English is called 'tank but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others. 
First of all, by his name flamboyant – although it is known as Marcel - of which has to do with the sport as it takes the name, according to legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf. 
The 'Marcel it differs from other by cotton, for his excellent single-sex cut, with its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) undershirts most known in the neck. 
But attention, because the Belgian brand does not only that the tank top. 
But it also produces sweat-shirt boxers, rétro cashmere cardigans, trousers, cotton, babies, mini-shorts... 
The clothes designed for the comfort of his underwear. 
Even if it is a pity to wear only undergarments. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me" 
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality. 
At present the sisters Cruz take very seriously their new activity in the fashion. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls beautiful and famous who give their name. 
It was present at the promotion that the mark Mango in Paris to its new headquarters but and the presentation of the most important of the way that the Spanish house sponsors. 
Monica is warm and timid.

A very intense but, at the same time, exciting us. 
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season? 
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s we dazzles and we inspire much for our collections. 
I like very much to trip in the city and see the women to see how they are clothed, how they combine their clothes, I often do. 
Danseuse, an actress and artist, you are a woman very versatile: is it not? 
I believe that, yes, but in the end everything is joined and these activities have many things in common. 
Since I am very small clothing I liked; I wished go to my grandmother to look in the wardrobes of my aunt and to see his clothes. 
It was amazing, almost better than to go to the theme park. 
Secondly, when I became a dancer, I was trying to take care of my way to dress. 
The dancers like to pay for the tests, to look in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes it is at this time that you have really put in the skin of the guy. 
Suddenly, everything is linked. 
You have had there not long ago 30 years ago: it was hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years I applaud. 
I think that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock me no fear. 
I have done all the things that I wanted to do for very small and it gave me a lot of happiness. 
So, think you become mother? 
Of course, I want to become mother because my body wonder, and I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it. 
With regard to the candidate, I am not worried. 
What I will do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to raise it with a lot of love. 
Turning to the cinema, you expect the various films that you have turned last year. 
It is true, I look forward to. 
I am a woman after the theatre, I am very anxious and concerned, I would like to have everything now, but of course this is not possible. 
I look forward that the films' and 'The última hora busca In the tumba of Cristo. 
To see what you will … 
There are some days you have started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do not tell! 
I am not mounted on the bridge to the model. 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know for some time, to invite me to participate in London to a parade of Bienfaisance for his association in support of women and the clothing that we showed - I have paraded two clothing of our collection created for Mango – were sold at auction to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person at the heart move. 
They say many things about it, I know, a lot of things are not true. 
Moreover, the good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to pass for a noble cause if, but if it had to pay the pear, I would have done so. 
The important thing is to make life better for the women of the third world. 
The second offenders of drink-driving will install the system is' alcolock 
The Minister of the Interior is that the driver, who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, has set up in his car a system which prevents started driving the vehicle, or if it does not. 
The initiative has already been announced in June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is seen as a pilot project that will last a year. 
Its aim is the reintegration of the driver in proposing of road rehabilitation. 
The Minister of state for road safety but also the Directorate General of the Ccouncil Routière Foundation and the Technologique Institute for Security of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having led more than once, driving the car. 
The alcolock would prevent this because it is a system to the vehicle that measure the rate of alcohol in the breath and to start the car if the driver does not before; or when the alcohol content of the driver is higher than allowed. 
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver. 
In this regard, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with this system set up to 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain we believe that this could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure is the administrative penalties for two reasons: do against them before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by normal channels but, however, the reform criminal by requires a reform of the organic law. 
The system is not yet available on the Spanish market trade in any form, although some industrial vehicles and office already has an experimental as. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to the school bus this system as it has been done in France. 
In Mexico without 'peep-toes' 
At 5.40 p.m., official time - the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were landed in the airport presidential Hangar Benito Juárez Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of grovelling but its shelves obliged to add the visor as to be able to see the royal couple off the plane. 
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours ago I asked in the street, the taxi driver, if he was aware that the Spanish Princes toured the city to complete their journey. 
– Ah, well, we cannot go to the airport to take customers at this time... Êtes flexibily you here or …? 
No, not Mr, I am Spanish but I have lived here thinking two years ago.

There is certainly no appropriate place in the world to present a way that Paris and there is certainly no artist living more extraordinary and good living that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new talent to the fashion. 
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.

Andik, the owner of Mango, a suitor, as well as the Baron Rotchil have finished the evening without jacket because they had attributed to two women. 
Monica Cruz, who has presented to the store with a pair of pants and a shirt – his own collection, and for the dinner has metamorphosed in endorsing a sexy long dress and black, has moved when night during the visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they have shown us the repetition of ballet and remembering the good old days, it has seized one of the bars and it has made the gesture of a 'great bowed. 
Inés Sastre has not been for the visit of the dependence of the palace, but it has shown before on his mobile phone pictures of his son. 
The next morning we have had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another good man who moves in motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived in the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with its sheets, towels and asked in advance, that there was no smell in his room.

Speaking in his sleep 
Some children speak during the night. 
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it was not important. 
It is a mild impairment of sleep is somniloquie. 
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is certain that there are more than one who speaks for the night. 
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in life by example involved in an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...) the day after the child does not remember nothing. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other changes of sleep as the nightmares, night terrors, the night enureses to pee in bed) or the sleepwalking, but this is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fever, situations of stress or excitement. 
In any case it is a little studied. 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a quiet voice, with isolated words, murmur or with cries, weeping, long speech... 
In the case where the somniloquie is very frequent, it would be good to see the child and to consult a specialist, to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that it is a mild impairment, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to a further deterioration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a sleep apnea or stress). 
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Trying not to stir up the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore seek quiet games and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help calm internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies are trying to remain calm. 
Rappelez you that they are harmless to the child and the next day it will recall more of what happened. 
useful Councils 
Do not awake. 
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Even if he is talking about, he sleeps and relies. 
Rappelez you that it is very distressed several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in children. 
If you understand what he said (which is not usual), have not the temptation of the question to obtain information. 
You will achieve nothing, because in his sleep, he is not aware to organize its thinking. 
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is dreaming, made attention to the way in which you interpréterez information and the conclusions you draw. 
Do not tell the child that you can ask for the night to know its secrets. 
Even not joking. 
This causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, please do not worry, this is nothing bad is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern finally... 
Illhaeusern has finally found the path to victory on the ground after a long period of famine. 
Without a great match, the Jaunes and blacks have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a profit for the game. 
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty to speak. 
After a first attempt of the captain visitor Kauffmann which brushed against the skylight on an unprecedented, Illhaeusern would take lightly the ascendancy and in turn Fonderflick, far above the Hirn of the Roman Empire or Diebold came to tickle the defence of Dannemarie.

But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the lockerroom a dozen minutes later and let her teammates in digital inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will be able to use it and will not cause major problems a Eleven illhousien which has just fallen for "compact" its defence, except in the last few seconds of game when, after a big misfiring, the ball was very close to the board.

The sailors have already shown their determination in Monday, at dawn, tyres and shoulders to the fuel depots ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were to Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports in the Atlantic coast and the Channel, as the Sables Vendée, of Olonne, where the trawlers remained idle, or in Le Havre, where 20 boats have blocked the movement of ships of trade. 
The fishermen of The Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the Total refinery of Donges.

But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the national committee of fisheries, which did not support their movement.

Obama, the points in the first televised duel 
In the first debate between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to know who John McCain or Barack Obama, has won. 
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have proclaimed their own victory in this pre-election television would have been followed by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, though, has not been enough "brilliant" to enable him to stop its decline in the polls five weeks of the campaign. 
The Gallup Institute, an opinion poll published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49% against 44% to McCain), is the Democrat who fired out of the game. 
Among the undecided voters, who are those who count, Obama is election-winning for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a poll CBS. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is good instincts, "said Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The 70-year-old McCain has repeatedly put forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, but stressed the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first debate. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and expertise needed to be president," he said. 
A angle of attack said yesterday in the Republican television advertisements. 
Obama has stressed that he represented the future. 
Without dismount, it was concise and precise. 
It has put forward its ability to take the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", said, this weekend, a spot Democratic Republican for not having taken full account of the impact of the crisis on the "American in the street.". 
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, in 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an election rally in North Carolina under a rain beating. 
It was not even mentioned the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial rout clearly benefit Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most able to save the economy to the brink of disaster. 
"The coming week could be a turning point," said yesterday, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, has compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.". 
"Reaffirming that it would cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the ups and downs of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois has also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence by the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health care. 
McCain has wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030. 
Prudents, the two candidates have dodged the questions on the bailout of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election?" 
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday night on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject the results. 
Hundreds of Belarussians met Sunday night from the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature. 
While no results had been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation.". 
Some admit they have not even voted: "What good, since they will do what they want my voice," said a young man. 
They do not believe that the regime that has been good to foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic watershed. 
The sanctions, including a ban on visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were seen as own observers. 
They have not been according to the opposition. 
"We have been excluded electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the count," said Yury Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces heterogeneous, a grouping of 12 parties. 
"It is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that counts the votes, and here is the executive power. 
If Members of the opposition in the parliament, it is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament can mean the area to television, meetings in the regions and the draft laws. " 
The opposition must enter the political game because "it must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
If our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, between in crisis, and that we not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorat of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. ". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the election. 
It points out that the participation figures seem too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the way for all. 
"You have noticed that there was an election? the Social Democrat leader, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are better. " 
The silence of the night falls on October. 
In television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission welcomes their success. 
The meeting of – blood become course 
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, Dre Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the suppliers of the security and more efficient in the world. 
Above all, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously damaged by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, the national reserves of blood transfusion service run by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and the public, the government of Canada has established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster never happens again. 
While the judge Krever delayed to submit his report, some provinces have set up a committee to plan a new system of management of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled the mandate. 
Following the reports Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all the other provinces and two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Dre Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
In force of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public, "she said before proudly say that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population has confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Décary guard Dre, however, that "confidence is something extremely fragile.". 
Since its creation, the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, we have seen in Europe to many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is the strong since its foundation in 1998. 
"And we did not know whether the disease could be transmitted by blood. 
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports that when we do not know, and that can lead to serious disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, introduction of measures. 
In April 1999, it has refused the blood of the people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980. 
However, there are a few years, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
The episode has shown that the precautionary principle that has been applied had sense. " 
In 1999 appeared on the market a much more sensitive technical HIV screening tests: the nucleic acid (TAN), which can detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, which stood the tests used so far. 
The TAN have helped to shorten the period silent, which stretches between the time when the person has been infected and that when the first virus can be detected in the blood of our technical expert, said. 
It has been able to reduce this period to less than a week. 
It has dwindled substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that we can detect. 
These improvements have helped to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of blood contaminated with HIV. 
"In other words, it means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 and 500 000 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by blood products. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health, "said the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know what virus will emerge in the system. 
Just last year appeared on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "said the Décary Dre before stress that security of supply, Héma-Québec must also include an adequate supply. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing. 
The anti-cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes on average only 3% of Québécois eligible for blood. " 
Any person in health, aged 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can give blood all 56 days, six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory which responds to the needs of the hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they mature and can no longer give blood. 
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to remember and to encourage them to become regular donors. 
The life of today is so fast, there is rarely the time to spend an hour to give blood, "Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone graft, cardiac valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Héma-Québec, which is also the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord which was once seen as a biomedical waste is full of a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and we take more than a thousand per year. 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "said the Dre Décary which describes this programme to levy umbilical cord blood as very popular. 
"Several moms are disappointed not to be able to have access," because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this programme complex and costly in all the hospitals in Quebec. 
Soccer – The Impact semi-final 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round series of preliminary heats of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 the total goals at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, at the second and decisive game of the series quarter-finals the total goals, the Saputo stadium.

In short, But victorious from Kovalev 
The trio of Canadian is ready to take the season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev and Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has led the attack in a 3-2 win the Canadian the firing of barrage against the Florida Panthers, yesterday evening, at the Bell Centre.

Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout. 
"I am not yet ready, said the Russian. 
I have another match to feel comfortable. " 
"He tried to do too much in the first period, said Guy Carbonneau. 
But I think that he appreciated the end of the match. 
It was a nice ovation. " 
Charest on the North 
The Prime Minister does not exclude trigger elections before the end of the year 
Immediately after the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest finished visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected on the occasion of the by-election today. 
"Raising the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining within the broad lines at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin to images. 
Tournaient in 175.2km, on three huge screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by Google Maps, "cards, etc. 
Great resources as electoral period. 
In press conference, the prime minister has refused to rule out that it would trigger elections this autumn, although he pointed out that it was very busy. 
The "al-Hafez" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area," which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North – the northern territory in the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister has, however, to explain why the North was "a jewel in the huge potential," but gave no deadline, amounts of investment, or priority in the future projects. 
All the most a few avenues of what could be developed further, especially the hydro-electricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, has boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, diamonds, titanium, and even," according to the list of Mr Charest. 
"This twice as France," it is, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is among us, but it is with us, "he said, as to show that it requested a national myth. 
The Quebec was built in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the Bay James. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he said, after a dramatic pause to look at the wall-sized map behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory of Labrador, includes a section of the Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister at the press conference. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a border on which there is no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government, "he said. 
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the north," he said about the passage of the northwest, which is open all year because of the melting of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuits? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to their respect and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Member péquiste of Ungava), have already begun consultations with 30 communities. 
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benedict Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources) has an important place started work. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "we will be a common vision.". 
The development of the North would be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North Plan "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described the "vision" as being in continuity with the first Minister Liberals that preceded it. 
"As the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the themes of the end of the week, which was started by a large cocktail for the 50th anniversary of the arrival of John Lesage as head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois Barrage in Adélard-Godbout. 
"In Godbout, which has created Hydro-Québec Lesage, which has been quiet revolution and the nationalisation of the hydro-electricity, Bourassa the Bay James, our party has managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest. 
In press conference, he invoked another reference, conservative, the programme "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydroelectric dam project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest said his service was scheduled for 2012. 
"It is us here, but I can be," he told his militants, causing them applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this autumn, what the law allows. 
It stresses that it is fulfilled, especially by a mission of the board of the federation in China and a Québec-New summit. 
The General Council of the end of the week gave the Liberal leader a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including constitutional aspirations "past" as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular the recognition for the specificity of Quebec "in the Constitution. 
It also hope that the Quebec appoints members of the Council of the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting and that they have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec. 
From the opposition, we welcomed the broad lines of the al-Hafez North with scepticism. 
The péquiste leader, Pauline Marois, has been the development of the Nord-du-Québec that the government Landry was launched in 2001. 
In it, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, has declined to apply it. 
If it did, "we would be more advanced today," said Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in elections Jean-Talon (today), Françoise Mercury. 
The ADQ said support the adoption of a North plan by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is on holiday today. 
A country on de – 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Justice "(ironically) in the cabinet Harper, who allowed the summer say Louise Arbour that it was a" shame "for Canada. 
Throwing the opprobrium on this woman who has been a constant struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration in said so long on the entourage of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on itself. 
We are in a government that is the only one, among all Western countries involved, not to be repatriated its nationals imprisoned in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
A government which takes no account of the fact that Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, refuses to acknowledge its floor and left to stagnate in inhuman conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Summon, for the record, that international amnesty, UNICEF and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he has a fair trial in Canada. 
This is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it is important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps never after so many years of violence. 
It does not yet, but at the moment we are seeing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the word that Harper continues to raise and whom if slack in his mouth. 
Now is the time when there is no moral more: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen in the hands of a minority government so far (what thus after October 14...). 
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up to the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, it is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free speech opinion of Barrick Gold Orwellian 
In its edition of 17 September, The It published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
In an Orwellian logic, that the largest airline alluvium of the world has brought a further six million libel against three authors and a small publishing house penniless in order to launch a public debate "transparent.". 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they believe, especially in the case of libel proceedings, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate be lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his? 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book black Canada will have to spend large sums to prepare their defence and to fight, weapons very unequal, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the mines. 
The tactics in these fights unequal, is often of ruining the defendants to impose a settlement which will muzzle the opposition to frighten anyone dare look again on the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate is the public that it would have had to present his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally made by the exchange of ideas and not truncheon blows. 
It therefore mining to open its books, and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects aside the petitions and letters of support to the perpetrators of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can ask a "public debate" ignores the views of the public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it seems that this is only the highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather close to the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak. 
What does not understand or does not understand – Barrick Gold, is that the public supports the authors and publishers of black Canada is above all because it rejects the brutal manner of the mines. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate," Barrick Gold has also submit a formal notice of the authors of black Canada them, to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the surréel speech by Mr Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to a democratic society. 
It denies, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues which displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution, which will be able to do this? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic world, to which we belong, has long been known manage the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The pursuit of Barrick Gold too clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to a debate transparent. 
That is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that the governments are putting in place arrangements limiting such abusive prosecutions. 
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both houses of Congress. 
It includes: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, as well as a right of scrutiny on the salaries paid to executives of companies helped. 
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, said the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
"We have made great progress in terms of an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to shelter the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours by fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on the mood of investors. 
The time limit that we had given was the opening up of markets this morning. 
Associés late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were in favour of understanding, without fail, however, to express their discontent that we need to come to this end. 
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of some provisions in the agreement, including the proposal to allow the owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of the companies survivors by the state. 
"When the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, it is not enough to be welcomed. 
But these measures are necessary, "he said on US television. 
Asked on another channel for whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so." 
"The major lines that I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward. 
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said. 
The plan aims to buy up 700 billion with taxpayers' money the bad loans, and risk assets to sell the US financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble, which has led to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other more common forms of credit (PCAA) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of Republicans who wrecked the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to be out of this impasse since Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
In order to increase the angles for everyone in Congress, has also added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion which will add 100 billion if the president deems it necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be approved by a vote of Congress. 
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the companies helped it will bring dividends in case of profit and that it will sell when the storm will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the property loans concerned by this plan, and to set limits on the pay and allowances paid to start business leaders. 
The architects of the plan would be put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will take the green light. 
People have continued to rise against this project, both in the Republican camp that. 
"Obviously, Washington do not hear you," said of his constituents Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers. ". 
Animateur a small group in Congress, dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman present things differently, but came to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors of economy, including three Nobel Prize, wrote to say that the Congress not to urge and to look at the path to take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, we had a new proof of the global nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group, Fortis to 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would acquire its competitor in trouble since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis mortgages at risk in the United States. 
, Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 major European banks and of the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not the lost money, said yesterday, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, they get the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
This is something that savers and households like now that the time will be uncertain. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take over all of the loans in progress at the bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US) mortgages. 
The Spanish bank Santander yesterday that it would buy branches and customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government should nationalize since the start of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
Its beauty in the eyes of blue card was long its asset, people will say its weakness. 
If it was released from the mirror narcissist, the US actor to smile charmer? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent source claims have also far removed from the register of power that give births to the real sacred monsters. 
But what great rider of substance. 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, 83, died of lung cancer at his ranch Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the good years. 
Less monumental that Brando, who he was and he was long a rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also those of freedom and the collapse of the dramatic conventions. 
The blood involved are often beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
In these European roots will generate a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive egos, the ultimate sign of quality. 
For it is projected a whole country love of self made man, the fighting of the war in the Pacific, wounded in fighting, which in the early 1950s studied the dramatic art at Yale and is associated with the Actor' Studio in New York, before prevail in the theatre, television, cinema soon. 
The same man who militated for civil rights was also the pilot cars, which is ranked second to 24 hours the Mans in 1979, doubled a sex symbol, although a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward. 
Disparaissent also with the grey areas of this Skripka secret, discreet, committed, allergic to bursts of show-business, which is not quite cracked the puzzle. 
An honest man, in the truest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman with the vertigo the movie buffs the end of the week, then talk that its major roles on the black screen memories. 
More than half a century of American cinema a changing passes through him. 
Reviennent compete in the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting its sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Chatte on a roof burning adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive to Mr Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage, which did not fulfil all its promises. 
Both other Paul Newman are history. 
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, Somebody Up There Likes unforgettable in Feargal (Marqué by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, who started really Newman in 1956. 
This gangster appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (The Arnaque), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Joueur of ping pong bitter and avenger in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the character on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which won him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine appointments. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
The times to rush through its journey. 
The young people are above all through the cultissime Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of unorthodox ice hockey. 
His fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy Coen brothers. 
With a final role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
In a number of legends film, which released early enough, Newman will be remained long in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its good and its concessions. 
The French director Bertrand Tavernier, was not without irony, as a "living challenge to the" underplaying "judging its benefits too supported. 
The profession has not always been kind to the Paul Newman in which the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
It showed, however, less often young people first that the marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, swine or desperate, including its features perfect reflected the abuses and the revolt. 
As director, Newman revealed aspects not acknowledged its true both sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew an end female portrait of melancholy. 
He who lost his son Scott by overdose he dedicated his film Harry and His in 1984, of shame and sadness. 
Among the rain of tributes which surged yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better." 
Générosité, love of the existence of vibrating features actor disappeared. 
Despite his career legend is fading, a great crusader for civil rights, the environment, the independent cinema, a contestant excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen a lot his mug sit enthroned on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other food, saying the process quite bad taste, although joke at the outset. 
The profits of these sales, however, were paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will be committed until the end. 
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Still and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be there. ". 
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of a US artist if lucid and generous. 
Citizen model, in sum and above. 
What could well make Zuschlag & amp; Company plant in their bills? 
The October 8, will start the hearings relating to the criminal procedure, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanent and regular, having drawn the damage particularly important. Other charges against them, for example, forgery and use of false. 
According to the prosecution, the money from subsidies, was spent for personal use, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, would in the coffers of the Fiatal movement Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to receive the money subsidies obtained with bills of expenses, behind which no real provision was provided and, associations do not respect their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were false. 
For these, they got the bills to the market of Józsefváros, while they were the stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies that would be on the bills, it was decided, among other things, during tours in Northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the statement, he should identify pensions and restaurants. 
For personal consumption, he called for a bill, on the model of which they carried out the other bills that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the municipality Capital for access to subsidies. 
The majority of bills was created by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, which according to our information, was especially to draw up the files for subsidies. 
In a "spotting circuit," a choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, said the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people have this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the Jövőért Jobb Foundation, which will bear the name of Együtt Harmadik, Évezredért, grouillait of forms and content. 
A pension, Badacsonytomaj, was not in fact that three rooms, and up to a maximum of 10 people were able to spend the night. However, the bill mentioned hundred customers. 
The issuers of bills on the imagination overflowing have also fallen, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, belonging to the hotel and catering sector. In their accounts, or the name of Jobb Jövőért, or the Hoppá it appeared, according to the information to the public prosecutor. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, said that when the prosecutor hvg.hu site has summoned and showed the bills, he knew, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp." 
It added: "Beyond the form, the fact that after the bill, 100 people have lived there, do not stuck, since this establishment are only 11 rooms, who did not. 
In addition, the bill also mentions meal, and our restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
The issuers zealous bills are not informed on travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. Thus, naively, they said the visits to Hungary on bills to pay in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency. 
In surcroit, as it became during the investigation, they added the VAT on these documents, while the benefits on the activities of travel, including the destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Similarly, the rate of VAT on four bills in the name of the Révfülöp Hotel in the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the provision of society do not pay VAT of 25% as said, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, employees of the hotel bills are not printed, while the false were drafted. 
The survey shows that "the issuers" have also committed errors in stating that the provision the carriage of goods by road, sending the company that bills could not exercise, given that his profile was the investment advice. 
Moreover, it is also for unprocedural forms, such as types of bills inadequate and false tablets that bills issued the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, 21st. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be false. 
Just as in the case of society Ravenna Bt. or sports training of Kunfehértó, which both deny the invoices issued on their behalf. 
The forgers have not paid attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of society denies having made this bill. 
Factures deliberately established 
Another category of issuers of bills is composed of those who were fully aware that it was asked to make fictitious invoices. 
The Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal – Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a bill on the order of the Együtt Foundation has Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the Collab society Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and that by 2003, issued bills on the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány CEA, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for a total of about five million HUF, but behind that no provision has actually been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, not more, given that the invoices were cancelled by the result, but the agencies have avoided mention in their accounts. 
The following category of issuers of bills is that companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the delegate of the director general of the society Trió Delta Kft., dealing with the trade of fuel and vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was nowhere to be found, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company has issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment, to the tune of about 18 million HUF. 
According to the investigation, the equipment would have been bought by society Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, Iván Kubatov would also sent documents with society, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued bills on the order of Atlasz companies, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that of Romanian companies have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. Jos-Investment and BT. 
In fact, none of these companies do not worked, what the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work. 
It is dealt with these companies, since at the request of Mr Zsolt Szente, co-defendant and editor of the foundation of the companies, it has established bills on their names, the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov has given to bodies, 15 bills in total, made by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Jos Fa-Bani, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The prosecution believed that 10% of are indicated on the bills and VAT in the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. for fictitious bills that have been used in the framework of the request of subsidy of Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség Association has Modern Magyarországért have applied for a grant from the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They have achieved this subsidy for an amount of HUF 500.000 twice, but these have not been used for the purposes indicated in the request. 
To avoid that it does not know, five fictitious invoices received society Works Team Kft. have been presented to the MRI. 
Moreover, these bills that have been found during the raid on the office of Árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
During the hearing, some of the accused will relate the method of manufacture of bills, as it had already done before the prosecution earlier. 
What would be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag itself, decides to lift the veil on history. 
Up to now, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised on several occasions to tell the details, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the return of a large part of the 50 million HUF Zusi, would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably offended, since the requests for his house arrest, on the basis of an easing of the conditions of his detention, continually fall on deaf ears. 
For those who have caused much more damage, and the authors of economic crimes not repairable, roam freely, or at least expect to their own home, the end of the procedure. He has not this possibility. 
The psychology of one-upmanship: why dépense-t-on more money? 
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
The researchers in neurology and economics from the University of New York have managed to update the neurological basis and economic behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
According to their study, published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dependent in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price. 
The research has tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" with the help of experimental auction. 
One of the groups of volunteers to play lotto, while the other group was taking part in a playful auction, while with the help of a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), the researchers tested the brain areas assets experimental subjects. 
In the two games, participants could earn money, but during the auction an important element of which is the surfeit of a third, all under the brain, called the striatum, was in intensive movement at the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is with the brain to the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In support of their theories, economists in this group of researchers said analyses. 
During these three groups overbade a partner, in various circumstances. 
They were simply informed the group monitoring the real value of the product in question, and they have done their implementation. 
In another group, they have promised that, if released, winner of the party, then they would receive $15 additional, reward. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost money, if they lost the bidding. 
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was put in on the victory, while another, on the failure. 
By proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players against the failure "were prepared to put higher than those carried out by the group and the control group" for the victory. ". 
"These results cannot be proved by any existing economic theory. 
Indeed, each of them Beyhan in the auction by the pleasure of winning and the parade to the risk. 
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now, on a third explanation. ", said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the faculty of economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when we should consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic disease of the liver is mentioned among the main causes of death. 
It is estimated that thousands of people carrying the virus of hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is the fact that often the patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to the liver and infections caused by different viruses. 
There are a lot of similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the yellow are characteristics, but the pathogens and diseases caused differ. 
The virus hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and organic liquids (sperm, having secretion, saliva). 
For passengers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against the virus A and B. There is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A are two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a bad state of weakness, stomach pains and nausea. 
Then develop on the skin and white of the eye a yellow visible, the saddle become more clear and urine color takes a more bed. The recovery could take two to three weeks. 
Around the world, each year, a million people die of the worst form of the disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. 
Most of the patients do not know of the virus, because the gene destroys pathogenic underhand way liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear that after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who received a transfusion before 1991, consumers of drugs and the tattooed. 
At present, we figure to 200 million patients suffering from a type of chronic hepatitis C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the lab, it is advisable to consult a doctor from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is said. 
On 30 September is World Day of hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representing patients throughout the world. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone who is growing in God ressent-il less pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of analgesic, which would have helped to make more bearable death of martyrdom Catholics. 
The Telegraph British newspaper published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford have done an interesting experience in analysing what level the belief in God could influence the tolerance for the pain of the human being. 
In the context of this experience for the bizarre, 12 faithful Catholics and atheists have been subjected to electric shock therapy, for each one of them was a painting representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the faithful Catholics were able to exclude a large part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it has also discover that Catholics have been able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians are from various sectors of the university. 
More specifically, the experience can be held as follows: an instrument making sparks and disseminating the ECT is set on the left hand of the experimental subject. 
The researchers asked participants of the experience of watching intensively two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in the ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. 
The researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary is a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scan, and during this time, have received 20 ECT in four is succeeding, while looking at the painting religious theme, the more general theme. 
Catholics have said that in view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "security," as someone who "takes care" and they were quiet and peace has invaded. ". 
In the view of the thematic paint religious, they have reported 12% of pain in less than when they were watching the practice of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, atheists, provided to find the appropriate. 
"We should find an image which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, there is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the issues if we show the believers a painted by Leonardo da Madonna or by an artist of the same diameter? 
Is that the sight of a Virgin Mary better quality would lead to better results? 
You are what you reveal to your subject 
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way that the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, which experts they should consult and what are their centres of interest. 
It is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society. 
While in regard to the sceptics establishing a parallel with the Orwellian vision of horror, they do not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt has said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google to respect their original purpose was as follows: "Recueillons in a system all the information in the world.". 
According to the leader of Google questioned, after ten years of a chamboulement world, they are still at the beginning of their objectives to be able to deal with all the information. 
In the question: that there will be in five years? Schmidt said he would like to see Google can answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that I would be the better?". However, software cannot respond to this type of question, simple at first glance, that the day when they know enough about the users. 
It is not quite clear to all users that the words used for research on the Internet, IP address of the computer, which sends the research and the pages consulted then by the people involved are listed. 
For the programme Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, to store their own history of research and can consult what they sought, what they have clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, recommendations based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if we look at what is my job? ask users, who are worried the monopoly of information to Google. 
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by the company that can create fear, and this is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or perhaps the revolt against the power that can cause among Internet users a contre-réaction. 
It is, however, a fact confirmed that the terms sought are not only made but in justified cases, they are sent to a third, and in this type of case law, nothing protects the rights of Internet users. 
The most dramatic of these days is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilian, in which Google has sent to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the page called Orkut, allowing public identification. 
The Internet users who are concerned about the rights of the individual could breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google, arm with the EFF electronic legal protection, has proved his right in court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request of the FBI, of any kind. 
(At the same time, the federal government has achieved success with some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research that he won by the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years ago. But in the end, he fails to get the lists of research private users, or the whole list of Internet sites and key words of the last two months.) 
The trial of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is attacked by those who fear the transfer of their personal data, because they believe that their intimate and private sector suffer when they begin to use the Google services. Therefore, they address them in the spirit of revolt that we demonstrate against the multinationals proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the US geek culture and its "wild stocks" fans, the activists and enthusiastic users of the computer which appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big business, "the corporation plugged," by opposition to his rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, even if all the two are fighting for the same objective. 
This can be explained by the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users of identification code, do not ask for money for its applications. The code documentary and the package of programmes, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and more relaxed, with the practice of official giant of the software. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the relationship issue between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the key word as proclaimed in recent years, just behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something that the cooperation, the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication available to us, and for the extent of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: are exposed. 
A young, in general, can take a profile on several pages of Facebook, to Xanga, and it can even link them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing its musical habits. Second, it can link them to a system of FriendFeed or Blip.fm., as these young people can also take blogs, in which are automatically their most recent galleries of photos they store on Flickr and Picasa. 
For that we can be aware of many examples, such as the then-girlfriend which includes easily to the order of the photos in the morning, taken by the circle of friends, with which his friend infidel spent the evening, and the company that has dismissed one of its employees for the sincere opinions that it wrote on his blog about the top management, we can be on one thing: the end of privacy is totally to reconsider our days. 
Those who live a life Online, is made up of what it shows itself, so that we can define the principle behind the behaviour of young people today. 
He wants to hide something, or at least to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can make (starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, leaving no trace intentionally). 
The number of people who, deliberately, does not have public pages so that it is not possible to find, is not insignificant. The services of Google Online, the treatment of text in the treatment of image, the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and bring together our best profile, having existed until this day. 
The public expects, without actually hide, when Google will reveal its true nature. 
The company, with its present value of 156 billion dollars, is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The AdWords / AdSense advertising areas threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the provision introduced at a speed of more and more important cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but in many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers are critical, in addition to all this, the contradictions have worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the mother and after that society has deemed too expensive restoration daily multiple, taken at any time. All this pales next to the fact that in 2006, Google agreed to the Chinese government and the terms of their agreement, the company detect all the results which offends good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are not announced when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and years, they will make the world on new points. While some believe that the draft scan and storing books and magazines dimensions of Google is so important that the company will soon find themselves facing the Supreme Court of the United States, other tremble before its system Health, because in it, we can build a comprehensive medical benefit from our results of analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a genetic database can give a good material for the next generation of science fiction. The novel of the Grammy-winning Cory Doctorow, written with demi-tons orwelliens, described the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening nothing that through the data to Google. 
Two miners have helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of Ózd 
"The police have summoned two minors for questioning in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to the suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." – said the stattion spokesman for the Department of Borsod. 
The young people have acknowledged that their charges. For the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, which, according to the MTI information Télégraphique (Hungarian) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The murder can bring a detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect in the double homicide of Ózd, a young man on the corner of 23 years, has been remanded in custody Sunday. 
The charges against him are murder, committed with premeditation and multiple by interest. 
During the investigation, it is revealed that the 23-year-old was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not want to settle its debt and it is for this reason that it drew its creditor last Wednesday in a site of Ózd where it has killed, as well as the girl of this man, aged 9 years. 
According to the MTI information, the young man was premediated his crime. The weapon with which he would commit his crimes hidden on the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police examines the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made a proposal for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange 
The stock market values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the acquisition of 100% of the package of shares in the stock market values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the stock market values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that Poles have made despite that, previously, the Czechs have ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange circle of potential new owners of the stock market in Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock market is in the hands of the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which wants to separate from more than 60% of its actions in a few months. 
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest that has been made so far for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
According to the press in the Czech Republic, the stock market in Vienna, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the 100,000-dollar Prague, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner the less good, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future. 
The value of the stock market in Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by the specialists of the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis is worsening day by day, the leaders of the European press decribed a "second September 11." 
"The global financial disaster, we must to US President – accuses the Rome daily La Repubblica." The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised rushed to help a desperate situation. " 
In a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership there, which has led the world economy on the brink of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system are increasing every day, and subsequently, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however after the vote of a real threat that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the air, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place. 
We cannot ignore the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva. 
Some states can still be a lifeline to their financial bodies staggering, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then or financial resources, or new improvisations will not be enough. 
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union are few cases of their national egoism and centralise control over the financial markets. 
On Monday, the weakened financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros, the newspaper Der Standard, Vienna, adding that the fears that European taxpayers also will have to pay, very deep, similar to the way in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really worked on the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crosses, hand in hand, the old continent. 
"The rescuers" should not raise immediately 100 billion euros, against this would be good if they noted in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim to prevent more damage. 
The intelligent car following the theft of drone 
What method would be best to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if this is the imitation of a detector obstacles that already exist in nature? 
As for example, that of bees. 
In the draft surprising presented at the CEATEC, with Japan, bees buzzing have given the idea strategic departure to the engineers from Nissan, for inspiration on how they should view the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system to control bio-inspiré auto-robotisé, BR23C type, he has equipped qualities of bees, the ultimate objective is to encourage the development of a system to avoid all the obstacles. 
At its flights, each bee is its own area, oval-shaped form, which in reality is very similar to our hull of secure protection, – said at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of research and development and technological public relations of the mark. 
The look at aspects of the bee plays an important role, because it is able to see in all directions, in a corner of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have raised the idea of laser rangefinder to. 
It identifies the obstacles in a corner of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which turned into evasive manoeuvre. 
The perception of the obstacle is taking place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini car robot, imitating the movements of the bee immediately change the direction of its wheels in the shift from a enough to avoid the collision. 
Contrary to all existing system, this evasive manoeuvre takes place fully instinctively. 
"If it was not the case, the mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," said Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory Mobile and the project car robotised. 
It must react instinctively and instant, since this technology is the most vulnerable and most of the envelope, a layer of protection for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
All this process must reflect what the bee to avoid other bees. 
The process should proceed in a blink of an eye. 
By contrast the bees, the difference cannot go to the bottom or diagonal, it cannot be that two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, to the place of endless combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, we could not use the movement and the acceleration and the slowdown as efforts at the disposal of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses polymer Lithium batteries, which are lighter and whose focused energy is greatest, which makes their life longer than in the version Lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent response instinctive which is vital, not the treatment of data, and even less the ability to store. 
This mechanism must deal with a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them. 
It is not necessary to the store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous games. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory still. 
It does not need a gigabyte of memory capacity, or even méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the instant avoidance. According to the estimates of Nissan, this system will its entry in cars manufactured in number in the next ten years. 
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination without obstacles in his path. 
It has even given a name to the baby out of 
The written version of the economic rescue plan $700 billion to buy the dubious credit banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters announced that during debates even until after midnight local time on Saturday, the east coast, congressional leaders agreed on the controversy that exists for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total of 700 billion dollars. 
"We have taken a major step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives, after which it is to implement the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and be effective, however other measures must be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here, the bailout of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20h local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. in the morning local time, according to the Central Europe), but has not caused spectacular rise in the stock exchanges. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote the bill responding on behalf of emergency economic stabilization of the year 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
On Saturday, President George W. Bush has spoken to Pelosi, then the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved this night, and we are very appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House. 
Moreover, the programme differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it stated that the $700 billion must be spent only once, for the purchase of securities on credit. 
From now on, the half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This will first secretary of the Treasury to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of 100 billion dollars will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part. 
The cost of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the secretariat of the Treasury will be able to implement a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, buy bad loans, securities and mortgages on bad mortgages and other types of debts "toxic". 
The ministry competent people have said that the takeovers can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule allows companies to take part in a programme of insurance, where the secretariat of the Treasury guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, the vast purchase of dubious claims to their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system triggers the collapse of a major financial institution or another. 
"We are going to make the necessary arrangements, to be ready to the application of the law, as soon as it will be signed," he said. 
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect that their allowances, called simply golden parachute lands across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The ceiling of wages is mentioned only in the specific case. Moreover, the restrictions on the way in which the secretariat of the Treasury proposes its aid to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the secretariat of the Treasury buys in the framework of an auction, they will take a surplus of tax on the golden parachute lands, unless the president of bank based on discredited. 
Immediately after the purchase of bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders should not be exaggerated. 
For the image is complete, we must add that the existing executive parachutes are not changed. The ceiling is that the new contracts, to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the salaries of the Directors-General – said the chairman of the committee in charge of financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
Moreover, the state has a right to acquisition of shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers is decreasing, since they may even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will land on their feet. 
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which will rule on the way in which the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Both sides, of course, those who have expressed doubts about the plan. 
This does not mean that the American citizens we have mandated, this does not protect the taxpayers' dollars, said the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur believe that it is the same people who are taking measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Barack Obama and McCain both support the plan to rescue banks 
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties to support the government's rescue plan of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of Treasury Secretary. 
After negotiations marathons that lasted for days and days, the representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue banks. 
The financing plan for the thaw in the crisis of Wall Street and the credit market paralyzed, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are the same, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, with the economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a bit ahead. The advance of McCain, achieved with the nomination of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, has melted away. 
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama has expressed his hope that Congress vote quickly the law on the rescue plan of 700 billion. 
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that he also supports. 
"The time to act is now, with responsibility... a threat your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people. 
It has not failed to describe the economic ideas of McCain of outdated. 
In an interview given to the ABC, McCain said: "We all have to swallow... but doing nothing is not an option.". 
The Republican senator said that in the proposal, are mentioned the creation of a monitoring committee of the Treasury and the capping of starting salaries of senior officials, and that he was personally very attached to these points.

Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House vote the bill Monday. 
The review of the German language area 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - and that the news magazine Der Spiegel, the low score of the Bavarian CSU in the country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of black and red. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the Internet edition of the magazine of German left-wing information, Franz Walter analysis of the causes of the CSU dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers.". 
According to this Sickinger acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU started before the sad duet Beckstein-Huber takes office. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed the Bavaria for decades and now, these same citizens their modern turn back. 
This change of time is also the problem of any Christian democracy, and this fact, also Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, arrived in a process that was likely it is that, just ten years: the unquestionable hegemony of the national party ended. 
It is ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU is summed up with 47,7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This is repeated three years ago during the Bundestag elections of 2005, at the time so mentioned Stoiber. 
The cause can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring his parents," put in place in the region in a way consistent with the CSU. 
It is 40 years that sociologists announce it, but they are very wrong on the pace. However secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase of opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more headings. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks, this is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who are rather far from the CSU, such as the self-employed artisans, holders of the box and graduates of higher studies. 
In these groups, support the CSU has fallen below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "Who? Who? The party chairman will be on the reserve with the issues of the coalition," the conservative Austrian daily with the internal political situation of the confusion that has arisen after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists of SPO want to discuss with the conservatives in the OVP. 
The OVP banned the SPO interfere in its internal affairs. 
The BZOe party is open for negotiations. The Greens still does not want to reach agreement on the coalition. 
The elections were held now, revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, the party leaders have barely suggesting their cards. 
Werner Faymann, president of the SPO, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the OVP. 
The SPO wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is actually possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership. 
The question that he imaginerait a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current president of the OVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer was, in any case, rejected. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molter reacted cautiously to the proposals of the red. 
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the OVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition and the entry into the coalition is indeed a very open. These points must be debated in the OVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZOe, is open to all new proposals. 
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to take responsibility," said Haider. 
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation in the House, as one of the spokesmen for the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law, which affects most Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner in charge of the work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, we find the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of the legal protection and European civilian agencies in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the office of the Group of the Fidesz MP Popular Party, Járóka warned that distinctions in recruiting, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their low qualifications. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary qualifications, and as a result of a basic education of poor quality, only a tiny part has the opportunity to get a diploma of higher education." 
Furthermore, Járóka insisted that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role when the other fundamental rights. 
The investment in the education of Roma children early means a strengthening of the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in a circle as broad as possible, also between the Roma and the non-roms. 
Indeed, a Roma child starts school, it increases his chances to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, it is the budget of the state. 
"The nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from low quality education and sectarian." said Lívia Járóka. 
According to the cooperation of the European Union geared towards an objective and action is necessary for an acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For that, compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. It must be given the opportunities provided by the democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of the future of Europe," demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Chances" guaranteed for all, the aim of the summit for equality of opportunity in Europe held each year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and the level of the Member States. 
CSU: thanks for a period of transition 
It is in October that will be taken the decision on the fate of the ousted duo Huber-Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful election, the heads are not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal questions the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is: until when will the grace? 
The fate of the pair, who suffered a loss of voice catastrophic 17%, will be on the agenda of the party congress, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of this pair very criticised have, in any case, felt that they had not specifically to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they are employed to appease angry members of the group and the basis, which a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" have demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority. 
It is five years - it is true, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the summit of his career, the socio-chrétienne union gained 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the single "sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of GDP. 
However, the Conservatives have always strongly in this region in the south, important key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal readjustment of the party, the Vice President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this small group of recognition, which initiates discussions in touch with the liberal FDP parties, as well as with the Electeurs Free, trained along the values of right, about a possible coalition of government of Munich. 
A mockery of strange fate has been that the list of Electeurs Free, between in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, including the Stroiber measure against possible coup was carried out by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then deal with without the very ambitious politician. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now was the behind the scenes, will receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and president of the CSU, has appointed the 28 September as the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber has launched a scathing remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have been much more support from the party. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be chancellor again if they call up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played an important role in the success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, barely concealing his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU does not influence of the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is on because it will not be easy to manage the CSU wounded, and the crisis of Social Democrats always. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko – his rivals: 110 - 0 
No Member of the opposition has not acceded to the Belarus parliament after Sunday's elections. 
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who assure him prosperity and stability, and that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegal acts committed during the counting of the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections. 
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million people is very well opposition for many decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition between its forces under the name of the Démocratiques (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ has abandoned its boycott originally planned. 
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political order as undemocratic Belarus, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. The Belarus has a credit because of the reduction of Russian natural gas imports more expensive, and has helped the passage of the society Beltransgaz, owner of the gas driven across the country, is in the hands of Russia. 
The fact that the OSCE, in the assessment of the campaign, has put the emphasis on the positive changes rather than on the shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of the candidates to the opposition, was referring to an improvement. 
However, the statement of the OSCE on Monday protested the campaign, during which the candidate of the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. But Russia with which the Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories for a month. 
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, to get even one opponent.". 
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in the light of the results. It is trying to get his message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concern in this area: we must give our newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities we put a spanner in the works for the spread, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly people," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as the main outcome, the layer of pensioners most supported officially really no longer regard as appropriate. 
"Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, citing the silence of a cemetery, is no longer a question of time," said Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers have called the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti news agency: "The people do not believe in words but in deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before the work.". 
Never in the history of the statement, not had been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from today ', is in force this new measure against the small clever, against which will then and drink coffee at the bar during the hours of work. 
The new anti- layabouts was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors tournantes- tells Brunetta- are an instrument for work better, with more productivity, more and more services of attendance," said the minister. 
Now starts a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
"It is reformism" Brunetta said. 
The installation in all of the Presidency of the Council is fully with the statement. 
According to Masi, the choice of the revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the secretary general: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all.". 
In short, over breakfast during the hours of work; more coffee or increasing. 
A pledge of Brunetta, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino to 7h in the morning is a good and healthy resolution.". 
At a conference at the School of Public Administration Supérieure 
of Rome, the Minister noted that "'in three months, the absence of disease, public employees have reduced by 50%, or 60milles workers in a year.". 
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration. 
Italian salariales- dynamics, "said the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, have united to contest the rules of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons. 
"while the Minister of Public Administration remains today the data on the reduction of absenteeism in the workplace because of maladie- the consommateurs- association of the people of the" lazy assets continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Public Administration correct and productive, gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, the Tar, the exclusion of additional benefits in case of disability because of service; the extension of hours hours domiciliaire constantly sick worker, during which are carried out inspections, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions advocated by the minister. 
accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Prevention crucial" 
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people dead and 27 people who are permanently disabled. 
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that white people were about 1,200. 
Figures indicate the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice as many deaths as homicides. 
To have the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on the dramatic Anmil, the famous today, in all the provinces, the 58th National Day of victims of accidents on the work, institutionalised the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying information provided by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the president of the republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the Anmil, National Association of maimed and disabled, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of State expresses its sincere appreciation for the continuous effort associations in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers involved, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness " 
"of course, everyone has the fist to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, are the clamour of the media and the involvement of the public, even if the daily reality we present the tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information" 
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, have a particular importance to a direct awareness on the part of young people who enter the world of work. 
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under assess the alarm on the seriousness, and improve the legislation. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed on how this phenomenon of "white deaths is a social emergency, insulting the conscience of all of us, and to all the institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly.". 
The data from the victims on the work seem to point out a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is impressive, "said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" trend "to be translated into fact a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention is release, that is the tragedy. 
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through many actions." 
"According to very strict criteria laid down Mercandelli- said more controls and inspections are needed, as a more important on the training of workers, and this, from school.". 
– It has ajouté- that "we must make a further effort in regard to the communication and public awareness. 
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers faced with a phenomenon which is a social emergency." 
‘ Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of conditions to safeguard the compensation for the victims of work" and "abuse of assistance to which the system is in recent years.". 
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker insurance guarantee – he ajouté- so that the fate of the man who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or the enlargement of the legislator" 
Lecteur Mp3, they are pointing the finger at risk. 
Ecouter music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as the Mp3 readers, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
That is what the European Commission, which, in a statement, the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen health risks and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"scientifique- of this report we read in the note- indicates that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years listening to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per day and per week, face a permanent loss of capacity hearing. ' 
"I am concerned about the fact that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage their hearing so irresponsibly irreparable," said Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to the data of the official scientifiques- Ue- it is a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make the information public. 
We need to review the existing control systems given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people who are exposed to noise that they generate. 
"The scientifiques-conclue the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard of safety which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but the concern is growing about the hearing damage which could lead to excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit these data making use of solutions such as the reduction of levels and duration of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Ue pointed out that the users of portable music devices, who are listening to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for five hours per week, exceeding the limits currently in force on the level of noise maximum made in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, face a permanent loss of capacity hearing after five years. 
This is 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we start in March we finish in June we will have. 
That is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of Rome "Capital, which took place this morning, the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla. 
In six months, the President Antonio Marazano and 49 other components of the Commission will the directives to Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the local council will evaluate the analyses and projects to present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The committee is totally independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are représentées- wishes to stress Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome, which can use the political decision-making, which remain the Committee and the Council. 
No list of roles, but only the desire for a corner where a great project for Rome. 
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific time period. 
In juin-annonce the maire- we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno reply: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be capable of doing, as well as the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France, thanks to the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on its contribution will be essential. 
Too often the policy is burdened by the management of the daily and emergencies that arise from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and further, prospective towards a more profound, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. ". 
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that the Commission is not a body or a whole unnecessary bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost another euro to Roman city dwellers, and will be used to study and get the best minds the Capital. 
For Alemanno, in fact, "there must be a draft strategic reference firm, or, in order to enable our town, to improve, which it is absolutely necessary, while thinking about his future, now a spirit of unity.". 
A future which, the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipals borders, but which will look at further 'not only in the context of the metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.". 
Obama? The first anti-American president. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, its decisions, destroyed the economy USA and were reports (as it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam. " 
The attacks against Obama increase as the date of the elections are approaching. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition.". 
Obama is really seasoned: he believes that he will win the highest office in a nation which account, two governors and five black senators! " 
In fact, it is attacks which do not say much; this is, of course, racially motivated attacks, and do not respond to the question of all, be a good president? We have also the polls, who say that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is also someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississippi River in the entrailles in the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know that the American patriot will give its vote. 
That is only one aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end. 
"Say what you want, we will see ourselves to the cross on Obama or McCain. 
They are the same people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States. 
revealed never run until now, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
We asked 1,500m people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent said: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent back home to the buttocks. 
In Iraq, 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness. 
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to be done. 
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time the deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murders" of the newspaper. 
Five hundred US journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Center in regard to the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not declared the attached information, feel less concerned about the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as they once were. 
The problem of US journalists, is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic 33-year-old destroyed. 
In addition, the losses incurred in the newsroom, in the room where the authors are working on the assembly of the newspapers, are a major problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want the traditional journalism as the general public, will be reduced accordingly. 
A clear but complex pessimism on American journalism. 
Six in 10 senior executives and journalists of printing newspapers are convinced that the journalism at national level is taking a wrong path. 
Locally, the group executive is to 65%. 
A printed against broadcasted. 
The journalists were not difficult to see where the Web. 
The greatest houses editors to clear a path towards the Internet, seen by many as "the murderer," the newspaper. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists is increased to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it "something good" for their journalism. 
Today, the stage the greatest in American journalism is between who run the newsrooms- in other words, the directeurs- and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that the reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage dropped to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the security of the work. ". 
The directors who lose their jobs in the space of three years, are 47% at national level. 
With regard to the journalists, we are going to 30%. 
That of course "work" at the level staff (our authors salute) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists work under contract. 
In a nation great as the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
The almost always receive big salaries, while the editor can earn 10mille dollars per month, in addition to the pension and insurance payments. 
As for the holiday, the logic is simple: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days, a number of years. 
But, according to their reports, the US journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The President of the second section criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the body of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the framework of the investigation on the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
During the trial, in the last week, he had the domiciliaire turned into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent can go the route of the city of the province to a house in the capital. 
According to the court, such movements (the token has not granted) would allow him to influence its society and have access to evidence that the accused. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon has already demonstrated a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of American was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street that to save the US economy. 
And that is the New York Times yesterday that we confirm that the current crisis dividing the Republican Party, still divided between its eve soul East Coast, moderate in federal institutions and the business community, and its soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington and the world of finance, powerful, especially in the states of Central and South. 
The soul, who has made an despotic way with the vote which I spoke at the beginning. 
But what has just been quoted is only one example of the changes, major changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or leaves already run: not only in the United States, but in the West, and can be not only here. 
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena sat on for some time, so that, in the new climate, they reinforce and are. 
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival of the Etat- category, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of institutions bancaires-financières course, which have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved, the balance sheets of the people and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This immediately creates a political problem for which governs: that is to say as to respond to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically but politically, it is almost here. 
The internationalisation policy seems to really out of the game, had little to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union, which shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies to decide no common political line. 
And so, it is the government of each state expect that all of the speeches, rescue and recovery plans, the new rules, and above all a love of credits: when it is going through a difficult period, there is that the states that have the economic resources, the financial resources to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use resources: two invaluable, elements of which no market or international organisation can never have. 
This new emphasis of the état-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the importance always that the most recent economic developments of the economy tend to give a factor quite linked to this element: the territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that they have now entered the kingdom of the network, the more sophisticated technology, equipment, convinced that the global finance was intended to dominate the world, we went to a Athens-engineered one, that our future will have to settle its accounts more with things rather material such as water, crops, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land, but which are absolute way to a limited area, a territory. 
For example, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that is not, i.e., anyone who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and water. 
I now come to the second new, however, provides for a fracture. 
Who said Territory, inevitably, Government, CLAUSE said, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena converge. 
On the one hand, the conscience of the objective need of authoritarian leadership, searching for a person who can take control of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of condemnation for the existing leaderships economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area. 
And in addition, something more profound, in a sense, even worrying: a shadow, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance which tends to involve the whole class of managers in a growing number of countries of the West. 
So increases even more convinced of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, with the same time, and to always be more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
The request in short, leadership, cultivating way, a powerful and ramified movement of délégitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are in the same electoral "revolt" or, in the changes of collective mood of recent very recently, from the Liberal-National rise in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebel American Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not come by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, their format, someone would have more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis, rising and potentially up too much. 
In view of all this, "a rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But we say, keep our eyes wide open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to march on the walls. 
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue, and in the future, walk on the walls as Spiderman. 
That is the purpose of various research centres, and today, a team of four institutes almost succeeds. 
With a tape was barely 2.5 centimeters square, researchers have managed to maintain clung to a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The ETUDE- The US journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those that we know who use a special structure, called nano tubes. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." Explique Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists are inspired by the feet of geckos microscopic strands of bush-clad, which will assure the animal, a perfect adhérente. 
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Téflon, and the paper, glass, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "stands out easily to the wall," explained Liming Dai, a researcher of the faculty of Ingénierie of the University of Dayton. 
MARCHER SUR LES MURS? – "this material could be used as temporary tape," said Liming Dai. 
Perhaps to march on the walls as Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think to use much less attractive as the connection between electronic appliances, given that the nano tubes are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could include the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, no super heroes. 
The AUTRE RECHERCHE- The University of Berkeley, California, to dedicate it to the search for a new adhesive. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the researchers presented a California five-truck adhesive microfibres as hair, clean car of dust during the movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant grip. 
Medicines: never with fruit juice. 
Beware the orange, grapefruit juice and apple. 
These drinks, consumed above all summer because refreshing and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, distort the absorbement increasing or decreasing in the case, their efficiency, even with serious health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, limp or, if costs associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a glass of orange, grapefruit juice and apples, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The grapefruit juice has been strongly criticised because held responsible to increase the effects of some drugs, tranquillizers antibiotics, start-stop anti, anti stem, and neurological toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE- This is the Italian Agency of the drug itself, which gave the news in a newsletter datelined two years ago, alerting doctors and patients not to assess the danger in this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if we take drugs such as, for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
PAS QUE the PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to the experts, the orange juice and apple contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by the grapefruit juice and the other. 
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology Public University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national agencies and international medicines to the need, change the informative notes. 
It is always to read the papers leaflets medicines that are, and if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist, "said the expert at the ANSA news agency. 
The Nobel Peace Prize of the economy to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Peace Prize of the economy has been attributed to the US Paul Krugman for his research on the models of trade and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at the University of Princeton and it is also a famous columnist of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms solutions in economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, the second event would have been more critical that the first, in terms of impact on the history of the United States. 
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and who was reproached the economist for years, but which now has proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked the speed with which the memory of the scandals such as the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, have disappeared from the public's attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an economist of great value, "but also a revealing style" very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft" 
This is the day of the spread of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open-source following personal productivity which aims to reach still more users, the house at the office of professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year ago, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new package Open Office is the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less crude, to other more important, as the compatibility born to the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
So interesting, certain functions specific modules, such as reducing the size of the presentations PowerPoint, useful, for example, to send them by e-mail, or import PDF file in the module to chart, maintaining the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create PDF documents "hybrid" between the typical chart of Adobe format the elements of a piece of calculation or a winemaker. 
The cooperation between several people is something that has had various improvements to the application of the roadmap: in the calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the draft texts, because each employee is attributed a colour of comments for a better recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud, the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and added to the English version, who was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available in addition to the opératif system Linux. 
On request, the installation cd can be sent home or at work. 
And if the issue of free can be a way for the broadcast in houses, it is in the business, that Open Office is following the big challenge, which can already count on various projects in the public administration and schools. 
Without the realities which offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the vanguard of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for writing the video equivalent of Word, Calc, is the roadmap which aims to replace calculation Excel; Impress presentations to the rival PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access report, is the programme which allows us to work on the databases; and finally Drwa is the graphics module. 
Objective for 2008, reach 5 million download, and that today we almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the budgeted figure 
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping. 
New cases of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's jersey. 
It is the site of the daily L'Equipe reported the news. 
In 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive 142km Cera Epo, the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher of Gerolsteiner, too. 
The blood tests carried out on samples of Kohl are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the positivity in Austria, Cera will lose its third place in the Tour and forcing expect two years of elimination. 
The news of the positivity Kohl Epo to the third generation, has been confirmed by the head of the French agency anti doping, Pierre Bordry, who has statement to the Associated Press, have notified the positivity to Austrian authorities. 
The 26ans Austrian has placed on the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and Cadel Evans, swiping the dot jersey for best climber. 
IMMIGRES: UNITED NATIONS: TIMES SI SE DEMANDE Strasbourg The TSE RACISTE? 
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" met with reluctance. 
This transformerait-il the A fine countries in a nation of racist? That is what is intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, in the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a nightclub biscuits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defined as the "paradox": the northern regions are those where "more integration and more work," but also "a strongest anti-immigration sentiment in the country and the most important support to the Northern League" 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, the Times has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
not only. 
Even the new legislature sought by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Tendance underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI to the Quirinal, has asked that church and state are working together to overcome racism." 
Etudiants victims of the rents, up to EUR 900 to a bedroom. 
The market for rentals for students does not know crisis 
According to the latest Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a room alone can cost a student, up to 900 euro to Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious point to exclude entire groups of young people, the right to study because of the overall costs are very high that the families of origin must soutenir- explains the office Sunia studies, Laura Mariani- in those cities, the strong demand on the part of students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase is amorcémême for the residents. 
In most cases, the rental contracts contain a series of violations: free contracts, not registered, without limit of rent, sub-rentings. 
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm prices. 
things in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it will need about 450 euros; for a simple, we will 650 euros (Nere Gaza area, an average of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 Vittoria (area) 
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, about 700 euros. 
At Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, it takes 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple. 
In Rome, in areas close to the universities central Piazza San Lorenzo, Bologna), about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Denominations slightly lower (550 euro for a simple) for areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save that if the people living in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple Predestina in the area, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed to 300 / 400 euros, for a simple we spend 400 to 600 euros, with prices higher in the Policlinico areas, Vomero Colli, and Aminei. 
At Bari, to bed, it takes 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller towns, the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major cities in the economy. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the rentals are often taken by non-Community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent asked the foreign students is increased 25 / 30% compared to that applied to the Italian. 
Farewell old cinema Turin, cities éliment the historic rooms. 
The historical cinemas are in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas is blind, it is as a face without" 
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what happens in the major urban centres Italian, but also in the cities of the province, 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large complexes, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events which we believe is inevitable, and it has all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime. 
In dissappear, it is often the historic places to memory, "it is as if one of my friends died, someone you know, with which we have shared a way and so many emotions" is the director of the Turin Nuovo cinema, which offers Tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the sworn in Cannes, and told the poetry of a province, and nostalgia for a way to live the cinema, can be lost forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of shopkeepers want to say: in the past five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the rooms of the main cities who have paid the price: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Bologna, Naples and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 to Palermo. 
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is head with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The evidence that confirms t that primarily responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplexing, because the three Italian regions which have the most new cinema complexes: 195 screens in Lombardy these last five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilie-Romagne. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrational way" observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should be to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a room in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to multiplexing. 
Not to mention the missed deliberation of the credit for traders: debt antécédente of the state is around 10 million euros. 
It is shameful that étique and moral point of view, the government does not respect the existing laws. 
To support the industry, it should be between 16 and 18 million euros a year. 
In the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mutuelle and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms historical centres and periphery. 
Among the prescriptive, there are measures of tax facilities in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter the area, and limited movement have special charges for parking spaces and in some parking lots. 
"This is an initiative which I very fond" Giuseppe Tornatore is "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. 
It is clear, however, that in contrast the super power of multiplexing, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is an issue which for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me to "New cinema Turin" which I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both experienced emotions shared, I turn to the other side not to see the blackened by the dust. 
links between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to harmonize the choice of the Mutuelle the interests of the Piromalli clan." 
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli's Liberal Socialists, arrested this morning for external assistance for criminal association. 
The levers for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his small son lawyer, namesake of the boss, already sentenced for criminal association mafia-orchestrated type, and to pay 10 million euros. 
"an affront to the prescriptive legal and moral, and especially in the right direction" said the prosecutors, and the two local administrations had expressed the wish to pay consultations to Mr Piromalli. 
"So we would have been given to the juges- -écrivent clan to go to the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement public administration" 
The President of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "collusions between the local committees and organised crime, there is a" in its region: "There are places where the mafia-orchestrated intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there is also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced have decapitated the Piromalli clan. 
From the end of April, the City Council had been dissolved, Gioia Tauro 1991, and packaging because of alleged organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the second round of May 2006. 
He shouted the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
It showed the vice Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having schemed for a political issue, but given the request was signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even manages to ask the variation of the project of the A3. 
I therefore ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, said the token is surfaced "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representative of a group known, close to the Piromalli, uniform choice of public administration to the interests of the clan. 
When energy waves, is now the big launch. 
That is a huge Chuandongbei which is more than 70% of the size of the planet and now the world's major airlines are in the process of discovering. 
Amid tides, currents, is the new renewable sources on which giants such as Chevron have asked me, and now are trying to get their hands. 
The opportunity to get the energy from the movement of the sea is studied for hundred years, and in the 1970s, in competition with the first oil crisis, the search intensified. 
When the price of oil fell to 1980, the idea to exploit marine energy was set aside, but now the environmentalists and the new increase in the oil sector to give a strong growth 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London said in 2007, that 15% of the world need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the swell of the sea. 
This amount would be double that produce nuclear power plants. 
In addition, there would be the currents and tides. 
Colosses to the attack. 
The first company to focus on the marine energy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, siglé has an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, it was not a true revolutionary. 
In two years ago, still more candidates among these companies doomed since still rely on traditional energy marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the océanique- energy technologies, said the spokesman of the US oil giant associated with the company, the Wall Street Journal- and evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us.". 
The cooperation in question is a deliberate allowed by the US Committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that it is precisely in Alaska, Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. In New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who travel the road to energy from the sea, and the amounts invested until today, although their details are known, according to the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, from the fact that the marine energy does not allay fears about the environmental impact. 
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small dimension, and do not seem to create big problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use of technology with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are various: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The surge of waves, which is to move the sludge to the top and the bottom is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the floats. 
The pressure spin a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator. 
The energy is sent to the side through wires under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in phase of project, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used to a military facility. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing energy for a commercial center and a parking lot using six turbines marine under the East River in New York. 
The movement of water in the tides, turn the blades of a turbine, creating rotational movement which feeds a generator. 
Verdant has had a long list of customers waiting the necessary permits to draw energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Research of electricity, deserves at the moment, the potential of the tides. 
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the energy from the tides that states like New York, Maine, Alaska and with others, to look at the coast, have invested seven and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
