A Republican strategy to block the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified its policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center this last considered a myth and said that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from a lightning strike.
In fact, Republican lawyers not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American States are responsible for the Organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of American Governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that hindered the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
Consequently, during the year 2011 introduced 180 bills that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter in the day of the poll, and removed his right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo identification document.
Indiana State was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
For this reason, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other States.
In recent years the authorities have supported bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo identification document.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a document of universal identity, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., 21 million people age to vote, lack any document of photo identification issued by a governmental agency of the State.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack proof of identity with these characteristics.
But, often, the obtaining of the required identity document costs over a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low income.
In effect, 25% African-American, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo identification document.
And there is still more.
In many States students, more voters vote for the Democratic candidates, cannot use the document of identity with photograph issued by your institution.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that tend to vote Republican parties to use documents issued by these clubs.
Before 2004 no State requires proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first State to introduce this requirement.
From 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens.
These measures seeking, clearly, limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolishing the voter registration the day of the ballot in eight States.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service of assistance to voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million people.
The measures taken since 2009 achieved new voter registration rate to fall in 2010 compared with the year 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other States that favoured the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13% of the electors of the State.
In the case of Hispanics it happened exactly the same.
These do not represent more than 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Course, Democrats legislators and their supporters have opposed strongly the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic Governors have blocked several bills.
The tax Ministry of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It could, in part, limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo identification document.
However, it is undeniable that adopted new rules complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that with them is intended to influence the results of 2012 in key States.
A report by the Brennan Center's 2011 shows that States which have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to achieve the Presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty if these legislative amendments to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of presidential elections in 2012.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: take the test or not let them?
Indeed, the PSA test presents, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides to carry out unnecessary medical interventions.
It is more than reason enough to doubt the men, already reluctant of by Yes, about whether they should be or not detection tests.
Take the test or not?
We have asked for advice to two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of infection among sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been made the detection and which not.
The study, with a follow-up at age 12, also showed that there is between 30% and 40% of chance of metastasis if not done the test for the detection.
I recommend, therefore, test beginning at age 50, or from age 40 if your father had prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You must provide all the possible options and not necessarily treat the prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case should opt rather for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who has cancer been detected are not addressed, since the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to his life.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if this progresses, offer a treatment.
More and more frequently we determine precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend to test in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine if you must take the test or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the international society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits are still the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoking, that rate will raise, at least 50 %", underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, we evaluated that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others are still totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms the health of persons.
"There is today, still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," stated the spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also favour the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, of esophagus, of pancreas and cancer of uterus.
"Investigations show that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they added.
The power
The Agency also recommended limit consumption of red meats.
In large quantities, they escalate the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The conservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salted may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", we explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, by the time his research is inconclusive.
Segú the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, was observed in another that was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in cancer nor has been able to be clearly.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about concerns and family history of each with your doctor.
"Do the detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a major upheaval last summer, and with good reason.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it's the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which still has not been observed empirically.
But for physicists aren't completely clear is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that is very similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, but still need more data to be completely secure.
Anyway, we suppose that it is Higgs, since the possibilities of mistakes seem few. We will see what it is.
In this big world, there is a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way of breaking this rule and not try too much, because you will end up doing damage.
Although the particle physics is a very complex world, has shown that there is a law of this nature also in it: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "State" comprising, roughly, of some of its features.
Physicists fall particles into two categories.
On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other they are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or however not by this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the inns, which we will not discuss here, and "force", particles that propagate the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson be somehow related.
These bosons, stress here, are not the exotic critters that we could believe.
In fact, if you read this Chronicle, is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as a "Messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes of address, "you mess" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; kinda like when we launched a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" was born, an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing else than a photon; in other words, one of bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
Same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs, which needs to be "messy" to bring this boson.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach energies extremely high, a little as if it were a pond ice cream in which only a coarse rock could slide across the surface.
Why need a huge particle accelerator as the CERN (the large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference) to reach such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do so, but others did not: a piece of paper, for example, not will remain ever by itself attached to a refrigerator door.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, do "can contribute" all those research?, asks the Madam Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and it allows, in addition, that the physical escrutinen differences between observations and predictions of the Ms.
Moreover, many want fervently that they are, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that cover certain holes in the model.
This must be said, has still huge gaps, as it does not propose any explanation concerning the gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up around 80% of the matter in the universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research on our day to day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we mistake by saying that it will not have any.
So: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser laboratories not suspected at all the revolution that would lead to his work.
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as already the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where they invented the laser in 1960, and he drafted the first continuous laser (the first were struck) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory equipment".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a sensor light in 1969 in the course of his research in the field of optics.
While it was not at all his original intention, this sensor serves now "eye" for all digital appliances in the world, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC would necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon as prepares a draft law.
Now, within that essential domain, there still is much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
It is just a few weeks, Mr. L. lived alone in their apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a reprieve of two years.
"I had given five years of life, but already have been thus seven", relates, made a pass, lying in his bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois de Beloeil, reached the previous day.
"But it is always a shock, we couldn't be prepared for this," continues.
The disease caused havoc: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eat by itself only.
Sitting in front of a tasty lunch, it accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, even smiling, talking to strangers who dedicate attentions, bring him drugs and offered a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that they cure me diarrhea, is humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy to this evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Back to his childhood, for certain people, it is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept this regression", he says.
Because, in the opinion of the majority of people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
All patients entering Hospice Centre Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that State, the team of doctors and nurses that surround them as do not offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of the Mrs A., 89-year-old, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"No remain me more desire in this life", he says, before accepting that I will place a mask to help her breathe.
And hopes, in the coming days, a last visit from her son, who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps to feed.
They are palliative care that are given when you can not do anything more.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for each 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that someday everyone will end up dying.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors from the Center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person are offered rinsing of the mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the complaint.
Already not controlled diabetic sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we serve beer to Mr. X, who died in the middle of the night.
This morning, his son ended up beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We can help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, Director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois Center days after without ever be the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savor their last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between their pillows while all drink to your health, a 36-year-old girl dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"Six months ago, it there's always three to five beds occupied by persons under 45 years suffering from cancer" is disturbed Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% Of the patients who are admitted to the Centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% Of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a patient arrives at the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in hospital or a care center.
And several agencies such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the society of palliative care at home from the Grand Montréal, specialise almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in the Quebec health care what makes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
From the month of October, a manifesto signed by Eminences of the Hospice, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system in Québec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone entitled to quality palliative care until is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently", he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency suffering great pains without necessary to alleviate it has been made.
I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists insist their patients until the last day, despite the worst odds.
Helene Richard survival hopes were already low ebb when he left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that he was very sorry that he wanted to stop fighting", he says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients seeking to die thank caregivers that do not have attended them in their demands once them has eased her pain with a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at home of Grand Montréal, the patients do not respond to treatments against the pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often use palliative sedation, used to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or on a permanent basis.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, not relieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
Patients who are not alleviated say all the same thing: 'I want to die'.
But that does not mean necessarily "wants euthanasia", but "I want I to alleviate".
The preparation of this report was made possible by a grant from Health Canada research institutes journalism.
Real estate scandals of large amplitude in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers for political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia have, day after day, they know a formidable 'system', whereby part of the industry of construction, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An "industry" that came out too expensive to taxpayers Quebecers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is sprayed one time have hunted big media", ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Deputy of Quebec and former Chief of the Montreal police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible through a research fund over embezzlement linked to contracts for roads in Quebec, to the liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had not consented but in delay.
The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, illegal party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the research in 2010, only the Ministry of transport has would have saved billion dollars in contracts", containing some of his instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Commission Charbonneau "has already dropped two mayors", adds, while waiting to get to "demonstrate the existing schemes behind the individuals".
An anti-corruption permanent unit, created in 2011
The anti-corruption permanent unit, created in 2011, applies also with its team of Auditors, investigators and analysts from the Government.
This unit works as well as police from "Marteau square", which, since 2009, they have made "poster of the sewer system" of Montreal to moderate at the time of inflating contracts.
These past few weeks, the unit proceeded to registry series of accusations by fraud and corruption against charges municipal as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resign from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that it has bagged repeated bribes in Exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the road network in Montréal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito has formally accused.
The latter has caused commotion to the Commission explaining the mechanics of the 'system' of public procurement.
The same three years paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
M. zambito handed out money right and left during the 2000's, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power.
He also admitted having organized an illegal fundraiser for liberal ex-viceprimera Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption effectively ran.
Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly to the Commission: in ten years received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and payoffs from companies in the construction sector totaling 736,000 dollars, all in Exchange for contracts of sewage whose costs inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money by inflating invoices between 30% and 40% in respect of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the Mayor, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay have done deliberately turn a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies from Montreal who sounded the alarm.
As Mayor of the District of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the East of the island, opposed from 2010 the sale of municipal land acquired for $ 5 million and resold by 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom.
70% Of the money for campaigns was dirty money
Research that will finally take place, she says pulling "a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, in order to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
And adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but a clean in Montreal research unit would need and be very alert to dubious practices do not recur.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is restless for the role of the ' "elected politicians aware of the stratagem".
Estimating the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec by 70%, said sarcastically: "have said me that that is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec Government proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as electoral expenses, are not strictly limit there will be dirty money in politics".
Calls for a complete overhaul of the system of granting public contracts and financing of parties: "we can avoid low; "go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to reconstruct the House a more solid basis, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to take a look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has gained a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have become.
Advance of day in day at his side.
Technical staff also has given me much.
And those elements I pushed on a daily basis to raise the level of my game.
At a party, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I do not acaloro me.
From my early days in the center of pre-training of INF Clairefontaine until my step for Saint-Étienne, I have always advanced by leaps.
You will benefit from the competition, recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are accustomed to play very high level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player as I have desire to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my position.
It is supported by attachments such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position I.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed equipment?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspired respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in Ligue 1 and is among the best European coaches.
It has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think that it will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very encouraging conversation with him.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The trust that has me also explains my good performance.
What you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken us the position of leader.
But we remain in the ambush.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the knockout style.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say against many and very good European teams.
We want to start, finishing the first of our League against Porto to qualify for the knockout round.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to their means so that this project becomes a reality.
Not to win the Cup in Ligue 1, as last season, it would be a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest our efforts in bringing us the title of champions.
Last season we did not get far.
In May we take back a disappointment, since we had the optimum conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a season much better.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if large equipment such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think that means expect more than the PSG?
It is normal they expect much of us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still are with things that reproach ourselves it is a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what more waiting people.
All the weekends can never win 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to launch a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, after two seasons, he has failed to qualify for the second round, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums spent, I dared with 15 points for the day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the Championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, "driven" have been by this new PSG.
That shows that the 1 League is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trofeo.
The PSG seems completely dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Best that I say we have a "Zlatandependencia".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that it gets a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of the League 1.
And it has shown in all the equipment that has passed is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men who have to its around.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows also to all progress.
How can you've experienced Euro 2012 with the France team?
It has been a disappointment.
I was excited to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to earn playing time.
I saw things there and left reinforced.
Today I managed to play good matches in the selection.
It is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it is that today we have an exemplary behavior.
Do have the vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "bleus"?
You are getting results.
They are well placed in the classification group for the World Cup.
Coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As it was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead to the selection to Brazil.
The tie (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, had not lived a similar game in my whole career.
Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The contrary to current monetary exchanges, based in central banks, identified transactions and charges of processing between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a protocol for secure Exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer to peer file sharing.
There have been about 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And near a thousand websites accept the bitcoin as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell 2 dollars five months later, before returning to haunt ten dollars today (contributions counted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not anything impressive when compared with the global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a published report on the virtual coins in October.
In it, described the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "racing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coin as "credits", used to advance in a game and that you can earn by playing or you can buy (and even occasionally exchanged).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositories of books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, you can also ensure that bitcoins changes contained in the public accounts book, which spreads throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write this new transaction in that book.
This passed by resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on the computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this complementary line.
It is a phase of chipping of file, i.e., transformation of a large file into a numerical mark short and unique.
Computers "pick up" the new transaction and add a number prior to "chop" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular fingerprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, other nodes easily verified that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would pay two times with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), the network just would accept as valid two transaction; the other would be an orphan, because they both have different footprints.
The computer that meet the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins in circulation number is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but are divisible to the cienmillonesimo, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase of computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen bitcoins in deposit.
"Used failure does not affect the same Protocol", said Pierre Noizat, you just launch Paymium, a company of payment in real currency that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB takes into account also the possibilities of laundering of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash has the same defect.
The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
"Giant sales" were launched in November.
"$ 30,000 Changed", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts the bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of an educational book on that currency, rather believes in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile contactless, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, leaving thus cheaper.
Carrier, also handles your identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in the trades, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Simply it supply an address that a phone can 'photograph and recognize", points out Pierre Noizat, which guarantees that thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems for most horizontal systems.
"Will need some time so that Bitcoin is imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB expected to revalue various risks, today regarded as high, where this coin to succeed.
We have come out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left its area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army retake possession of their territory and that the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished to Afghan peasants, who have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, more injured and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign, as in the times of the Soviet army.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks are attached even if their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these are not so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the planted hills of almond trees, thanks to French credits, was made by order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of release, return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of his peasants, overwhelmed by the Al - Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahedin, the current Government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, using Government land for resale as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, while benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts.
They're discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, I have heard in the field, aspires to a Government which is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, and they will also go to those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and their ideologies.
The modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan have lived and they appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25 years, Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, State schools are full of children both girls.
It will have to give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties or corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish booklets presenting a modern world has great fans across the country.
The army is now present.
Will be considered legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight worry already reconstituted provincial militias, which shall flee away from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western Nations. However, the United States wanted it transform into a centralized State, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister which existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled in April 2014.
However, his country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s or even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, not fixed any reservoir or important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and there is nothing except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, Government control would have been necessary.
Spread the rumor that Afghanistan had vast mining wealth.
And that did nothing more than increase the sense that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without power to extract minerals of iron or copper of the land and means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese almost have already left the month Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by World Bank) from burrowing the immense Buddha location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
You will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country which depend widely on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls schools, schools for children, a Department of French at the University, the French Institute, the cooperation in the fields of military, legal, health and agricultural and archaeological delegation support.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and perform the impossible task of making matching aid and offensive actions, service of 'civilian and military actions"of the Ministry of defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made to bring numerous works of collective interest and actions in dozens of towns of mountain agricultural rehabilitation through a small French NGO.
Those works, sweet for local labor, have been able to help to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, fruit trees, Sun protection and increased areas of cultivation.
What we will leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in those valleys often located over 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of demands written with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
So they quit the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want to, would need to keep a little help civil, well controlled and which reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play for everything.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given two months more to this Assembly to finish their work.
And nearly two years ago that Egypt used a provisional text, repeatedly modified, weakening the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has not done more to increase the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, President perseveres in its "autocratic delirium" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampled on the law".
By their supporters, makes sure that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the process of transition.
A referendum should be organized in the coming 15 days.
A period of very short time forcing the brothers to renounce his project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to retrieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in its favour, as stated in an interview with the weekly American Time.
Considering that this resource has voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "they vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of the constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals not attended the call.
In mid November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their points of view.
The representatives of the human rights, civil society and religious minorities did the same thing.
To achieve the required quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, substitute members, hastily.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the rated items have been unanimously.
Commentators makes grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so much so that several members of the Committee came to think that the clock of the constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 object of attention, is finally still identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For the Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberals branded as hypocrisy and consider that he is not more than an advertising trick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They relate, in particular, to article 220, which gives an advisory role, particularly for those who have confirmed their compliance with the laws of the Sharia al - Azhar University.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "call people to decide is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of theocracy".
Fears of Liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the same University would be quite less moderate than at present.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we are in the framework of the civil State.
"The majority of Jurists who have been working in this text are not ulema but University students, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr]."
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to pronounce above all this."
Apart from its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism relating to the extended powers conferred to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they are few compared with those who were under the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but a National Defense Council.
The prosecution of civilians nor banned in military courts, as they asked the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also showed his concerns about the text, which considered liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, henceforth, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, any article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only thing positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although Egyptian President was out yesterday evening on television, is provision demonstrations for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of State manifested itself on Saturday.
In Israel, the Holy Land, the navel of the world, and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The promised land combines the Majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"IDA" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal" receive divine grace.
And Galileo, the place of miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, appeasement of the storm and filled with nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers here along the via Crucis, or way of the cross of Jesus (in latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the fortress of Antonio, the Praetorium, where the trial took place and continues through the streets of the old town, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the stone of unction and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree that took the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also the most sacred site for Jews, the wailing wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As it is tradition, people of different religions here leave notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
A vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada fortress was what was left of a secret shelter against enemies, Herodes the great ordered to build in the year 25 b.c. for his family.
They found in the cliffs of the mountain at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And get there on their own, can only be those who engage in climbing.
Others can reach this historic Summit by the funicular.
And in the North of the country at an altitude of 1600 - 2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon station, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the Hill of bus services.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, in the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In one trip you will not visit them all.
But worth a visit at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (israeli Parliament).
The ancient Dead Sea scrolls or rolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and around 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces are preserved in it.
It is worth visiting the Museum of art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings featuring canvases by impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre model of visitors and bathers at that time you can visit the museo-bano to the Basha, who are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures.
In Caesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the sculptures by Rodin and Dali.
There is no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and categorically do not accept donations.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of the children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers.
You walk in and you're in complete darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound children Jewish names and the names of the countries that lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Bless you
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the dead sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and Oceanographic Museum.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature no less than 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still warm and there they bathe during the whole year.
By the way, this sea, the most remarkable in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters of there are a brine that easily hold up to those who do not know swimming.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine, and curative mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to put in order his broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
The old part of Tel Aviv, the Citadel of Jaffa, keeps them on the Mediterranean coast.
She passed the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it was here where Noah built his Ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with who, in this same place, took a long and happy life.
Love the tourists strolling through the narrow streets that carry the names of the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable.
Newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even other countries to photograph it can be found in Jaffa.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, can stroll through the Roman Theatre, 'taking' the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shequels (currently 1 - 3$, 8 shequels).
Urban transport buses, is mainly composed but in Jerusalem there are fast tram and in Haifa is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in any type of public transport costs 6 shequels and for this price you can travel by trans-shipment for 1.5 hours.
Saturday is celebrated in Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath.
From the Friday night until the sunset of Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport stops its work.
But the Sunday morning starts a new work week.
Only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish scales and dishes that combine meat and milk is served in many cafes, restaurants and hotels.
There is a wide selection of dishes made with beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruit and vegetables.
Stray dogs are not seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well fed cats that "stroll to your liking" in a impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ronroneadores love crowded places and not reject the sweets.
Rent a car, depending on the brand, it will cost $ 37 (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
In addition to insurance, which goes for $ 15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will go for 15 shequels day.
Museums tickets cost an average of 30 shequels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, visited Israel more than three million tourists from around the world.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were U.S. citizens.USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The promised land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, amount exceeding 51% to the same index in the year 2010, prior to the cancellation of visa on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights activists discuss the consequences that it would bring the law on the mandatory review, have already appeared on the country crooks trading in 'fake' certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive to Moscow, Petersburgo and other cities of Russia.
Most are citizens of countries of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its sole aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1, comes into force a law, according to which each immigrant labor should conduct a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the field of provision of services, community services, domestic services and trade institutions to the retail.
However, over time, as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not suffice to the exam of the language, if not also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew work permit.
Exception are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who managed to get their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 is not subject to this law.
Utility, fate and rights
The network of centres will work sponsored by the Institute of language Russian Pushkin, the peoples Friendship University, State University of Moscow, State University of Petersburgo and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants may be submitted to the tests in all the cities, now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was backed by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, much before that law came into force, they managed to often ask this question to the press: and what will bring this in reality?
Will changes bring mandatory knowledge of the language, both for the Russians and for the migrants themselves?
First, meet representatives from the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labor slavery".
Many people today speaks on defence of the rights of labour migrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the Federal service of immigration from Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of their rights must start before his departure.
Only a system of organized selection will allow the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Have the problems migrants without profession, education, which does not know the language or pass the medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, mess a "paid trip" to a spooky and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like it are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
In their homeland they promise them one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, deprived of their passports, they do not pay promised wages", confirms the Director of Division of labor immigration from Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov immigration service.
Do not be angry, jefecito!
However, while so many citizens of the Central Asian Republics wishing to work in Russia recognize that not only do not know the language of the country that are intended to go, but also in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few are the Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks, which can give the luxury of normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone dress them, wear them, and buy them necessary to the school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys dare to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is difficult, if you don't know the language, recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and bottom".
However, in what refers to the language Act, rights advocates point to an important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no or review and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or prohibited the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim to receive official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: twelve to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and by only fifteen hundred rubles.
The Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and are cases of extortion.
"They ask us one hundred or two hundred roubles for tea or cigarettes," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Come on, don't be stingy, you buy a painting"
The first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only documents of registration of immigrants can be false.
Several "false" knowledge of the language certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents were printed in standard color printers.
Of course, came into the hands of new owners not as gift: every immigrant, wanting to be make it easier to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost three thousand rubles for the immigrant worker.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption "diplomas" not to buy, the Government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities may promise to migrant workers that they had not have passed successfully the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, will be offered to immigrants who do not speak Russian works that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with firearms registered is relatively small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to civilian gun owners.
This is the Government's reaction to the recent incidents: press shots for weddings that fortunately there were no victims, and initiated by the Moscow-based lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, massacre in which press seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining license for firearms, 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law about the possession weapons will be carried to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone feels happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hardline policy".
The network has released an open letter, whose authors, representatives from various social organizations of shooters, demand that it desist from such "rigor without sense" measures.
The percentage of vandalism with use of registered weapons is minimal, he commented to the BBC Russia news service, Vasiliy Lésnikov criminal lawyer.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes using firearms registered in bodies of the Interior against the total of 1168 crimes reported for the same period were committed during six months of the year 2012.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of weapons for civilian use will not be a problem to lead the offender to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low prices.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Vendors: from factories up to official
The black market of weapons supplies through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who worked in the Ministry of education and the high State for ten years.
Screenshot of the website which accepts orders from weapons
The first, "vestige of the army or military", i.e., the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were pilfered by Russian officials and the same Caucasian," said Baranets.
The following type of weapon black, the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by officials of the law enforcement bodies.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often there were explosions.
"There are versions showed that some fires were deliberately provoked to cover the lack," says an exmilitar.
As per Baranets, arms manufacturers also put his two cents.
"Have now proliferated factories private weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow," said the expert.
One source of the black market is contraband.
Large amount of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There have their own craft, sometimes, and a mafia that has organized the flow of arms has been formed," explains the former military.
Where do arms come from?
Experts have calculated what is the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the center of problem analysis and planning of public management.
Reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly available data from sites whose theme revolves around the weapons were analysed by specialists.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market reached there "because of officials whose work is related to the weapons", is said in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of the cases is stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to "illegal archaeology".
Dependent of one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his last name was not mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators not nobody buys them from long time ago because they are too old.
More often, he says, providers are directed to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through any Ensign, the vendor buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
Removed it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
"This takes the weapon to the town and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two Chargers", tells us
"But, of course, the police is aware of all the issues, so periodically, when you have to meet the plan's discovery of crimes, they made test purchases to illegal arms dealers", adds the dependent.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who asked me to go to the platform"Begovaya", where he would be a man who would take me to a"corner"where we could negotiate."
The price of the weapon, I found out only there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"I need a friend who has contacts to get a weapon", says the clerk of the store. "I have a friend as well, but I hope not much in it."
In the markets there are sellers, but there also must be reached, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who called to tell him that a tooth fell from him to her daughter".
I can even get a pair of mittens of steel through a person's confidence.
He also supplied only to me because he knows I won't betray him.
Newbies looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
Schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was no "of all".
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
To the buyer, according to Baranets, not offer cat poke: everything can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; We are going with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the weapon to shoot well, we begin to negotiate," describes the procedure expert.
Shop sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it offers to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This is not necessary any document or personal encounters.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," written in the title of the ad "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
There users make their orders and put questions.
And sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", ask the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow", tersely asks his question"Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a vast network of fictitious web sites and capture two-hand to those who want to buy guns.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military and exmilitar commentator Viktor Baranets
I've heard of these systems: generally the web site is registered out of the reach of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions so you know where it is hidden weapon," says the Press Secretary of the NGO "The right to arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets said that if an order on line, one remains without weapon and put him in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a vast network of fictitious web sites and capture two-hand to those who want to buy guns.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia", said he.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one you can spend $ 100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
Wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking leaders.
According to official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the period January-October of 2011, the total number of these offences in Russia fell by 7%, what constitutes 22.900 and the number of identified cases of robbery and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of restaurants from fast food and supermarkets in the United States are striking.UU.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens are his first works as cash in "McDonald's"
In recent days, the United States has started a wave of protests against low wages that are paid in the Walmart Corporation supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
By now no one dares to assert if you will come or not this wave to nine points, or if you have meant losing forces and Taming is in its early stages.
Protest actions have the support of trade unions and a number of NGOs on the left.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart workers and the system of fast food, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of unions of workers in these enterprises.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the Thanksgiving Day, called "Black Friday". That day, United States coomenzaba the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that at times was accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their posts and formed picket of protest by unions and activists on the left in the stores of the Corporation, whose products are directed to people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, rifles hunting and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores average between 8% and 27% are cheaper than the larger supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid workers from Walmart to buy only at work.
The availability and range of products made from Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to their workers.
The latter also complain of bad working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the rally demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical worker from Walmart, received 9.5 dollars per hour, this spending is too high, they said.
The University of California at Berkeley scientists argue that if Walmart increases salary average up to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the Corporation $ 3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than what you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart put the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store them is only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what they spend now.
Supporters of Walmart say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine States and that it did not cause any loss to the Corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 o'clock Thursday till midnight of the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 articles per second.
In total, their cash registers were "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview to the website of left-wing Huffington Post, who left his post "less than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "another public relations stunt", organized by the Trade Union of workers.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where the objectives were not precisely Walmart stores (that in this progressive city they don't them appreciation, and that for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then not even grant you the disease down and not pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
No one WINS less than them in this city.
Is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of U.S. teens spent by McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, on time partial after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or plan to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that you have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author says that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday in the McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that starts to cashiers and fast food cooks to pay at least $ 15 per hour, i.e., is to double his current wage.
They also demanded that labor unions are created in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law.UU. It prohibits the Administration prevent them this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with tricks and dismissals.
On the other hand, rarely administration easier life.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the sector of food rapid.
A major is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally in the McDonald's located near Times Square, involving several local democratic politicians, in particular the Member of the Council Municipal of the city Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says that it is selling billions of servings, and then not even gives you a hospital or pays you for your honest work".
The protesters received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example of the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we support workers in the fast food sector to make receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that it deserves every New Yorker".
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American history of fast food.
But she participated in only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a mass movement.
"By now, trick the brain it is not so easy"
The subject of the reality augmented, so popular among fans to modern technologies, is lately perceived normally primarily through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Conference, Google showed a model in movement and later, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with the head of the Group of interactive 3D technology at Microsoft's Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, laboratory has elucidated for scientists from the company, the glasses already belonging to a last stage.
Attracts them the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces.
-Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of his research group?
-We are dedicated to the human-computer interaction, but also we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the flat-screen pixels, sometimes with finger touches.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since control concerned all gestures.
-Do more ahead?
-While Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of this still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
It should release the computer world to ours, the physicist, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
We will then complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
-Do you think about the control voice?
A very popular detail, but don't think they overestimate it?
-Clear that cannot be considered him a panacea, remains from resolving the question of privacy, since not always be that others are aware of our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project that we believe in gestures, but not loose, but shorter movements.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but for a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
By now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
-How is that?
-For example, how I asked you which happened this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
-Normally I only talk.
-Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
-Or do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do at this time machine?
-Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
-If we talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints you have modern cameras?
You lack resolution, depth, or something else?
-In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixel camera at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; This gives more work to the designers of algorithms.
Or that we must remember not only the resolution on the x-axis and and, but also in Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps really scarce, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our lab in Redmond, made a touch sensor with adjustable delay of processing of 1 to 100 ms and is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects to the human-computer interaction.
To me I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that doesn't require contact to make the frames per second more.
- And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
-The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor in the visible range.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a similar flexible kinect, playing with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how this will help determine the three-dimensional position.
-By what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, sunglasses are one of the most visible platforms?
-Of course, spend all the time holding up a Smartphone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: the best choice would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass the glasses to your Smartphone,
Sunglasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (the private things only you can see them), but also its weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses won't let work on virtual objects along with others.
-Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark's "Iron Man" film, but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that the critics often point: there is no touch response!
The hands do not feel nothing!
Do answers prepare your group for this challenge?
-In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand in support to the image quality.
Add touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at provide tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of various ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point the finger where gives a sensation similar to which one feels if someone were blowing him in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets wrist affecting the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
-Have you tried to trick the brain?
Do you think he feels it seems that I should feel when they see something?
-That's a good idea, we have not yet tried it.
Here lies another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that you going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of the treadmills (not as the gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
By now, trick the brain it is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes it attractive to work with virtual reality for the investigators, that many things are in a State of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "Avant-garde of St. Petersburg" project, dedicated to citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of the art and the scene of Petersburgo, whose achievements go beyond the city: often found recognition in Europe while Russia meet them even.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is like the artist Kirill Miller.
Citywide met Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red top down, which can be found close to the Russian Museum, near the summer garden or fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Pictures of Kirill Miller always attracts crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilosofos of Petersburgo storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of Petersburgo of late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, it is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in people smiles and lifts all mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organ of Petersburgo, since it has matured to make difficult role, by its Bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image.
-Kirill, are why going around town dress of red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
-I chose red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to the appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and the society.
Although in the society, everything that is not grey arouses aggressiveness and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed to start a conversation.
The history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
-When would have understood that you should be an artist?
-In an exhibition of the Palace of culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had finished, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became a friend of artists from the new wave, with subsequent who risked in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to the "Pushkinskaya-10", and already the new wave is over.
I sumí me in the theatre by the clothes, the music of all genres, but not by the letters.
- And all this joined in your art clinic... - for me it was important to meet me at the cultural center of Petersburgo, where the best creative minds had to come together.
In 1995, I took a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, Bohemian club, the Bohemian of Petersburgo House.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to "La oreja de Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang songs light under the phonogram, they wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the Group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was organizer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of a great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the art clinic."
There went our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was elected I, thus ended my completion.
In these changing times, it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who like truth, honesty, and the culture of the last century.
In our times, it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity go separate. One may be popular but very little cult.
-Something in your work recognizable.
-Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed today and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "Museum Russian clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns all smear and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, grotesque ideas I have.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and required change of clothes.
Now they remain one for clothes, focusing in the external, but not in the inner person.
And, perhaps that person not due him or shake hands, but spitting in your face.
And deception will be deleted when you change clothes.
-Recently we see you in the role of urban organ. -A cultured city needs a hero as well.
Who better than me to be!
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
-Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of the cultures.
Before people gathered in herds, the Bohemian wanted one thing, the greenhorns other.
Now all have been divided into micro communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a one hundred dollar bill to appeal to everyone.
Now we must think like who like.
Now, each hero worship has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands!
-Van to see him in the abandoned, there runs the sex-social sphere.
And a cultural event are 300 people, 10,000 will ever come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to trick them, do not spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young it was such pictures that a collector had them hung on the Wall beside Falk and Larionov.
I began with paintings, which usually people ends.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint pictures.
I am in favour of this culture.
-Kirill, what is what is missing Petersburgo?
-Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: official of the culture.
But not all of them can dedicate itself to the culture.
When the Kings were correct it was otherwise, the Kings perhaps did not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right.
In Moscow, there is now very good consultants.
We have people in Petersburgo that could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level to correctly assess these and open them way.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
-What is for you Petersburgo?
-St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there are lot more culture, there is land.
But on our stones is difficult art to grow.
We need cultural field and now have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity that attends exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We have to make the art of fashion, as it did at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be executed with a grant of Petersburgo.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans aboard depart in search of a planet's replacement.
To preserve mankind the main question becomes: how continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet replacement?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says researcher head of State Astronomical Institute, Vladimir Surdin, Sternberg P.K. (IAES).
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature of 500 degrees.
Only you can live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago that experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit not differed in nothing of terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects at the orbit, small fruit, the Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
As a result, we obtain a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, must be kept on their feet and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of problems biomedical (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia.
Finding no support, the chicks gave flips randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newly born gave a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that four days after simply died.
"And twice got the chicks to be born, but then leave it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space.
The last time that a biological "miniarca" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, will continue the experiments.
However, in the biosatelite "Bion" will travel only species of same-sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing was found supernatural.
"This was precisely in the biosatelites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, still has not been directly address the problem of reproduction in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, lose their usual habitat, simply cannot be their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women travel into space for the last 50 years.
Tereshkova became the highest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flying, and no one on earth could say: If after a flight into space.
You may or not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, this question no one has responded", says veteran aerospace Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
It was also the father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, Cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, are counted the astronauts who after long flights all has been well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it is more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind should seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory facility of the cosmonauts preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts practice their skills of work in the space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment for an adult, a child newly born is its native element.
The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that the life on Earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, then it will be easier to get then to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath, they spend only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something", says Navy representative, instructor swimming of newborn infants.
In short, if weightlessness is a natural state for a newborn, for women is required the gravitation, the force of gravity.
Weightlessness in the abdominal and pelvic muscles is very fast, decrepitan reduces the ability of expulsion of the fetus.
Well, omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a Special Chamber, this will push it.
"Do, then what?", Valeri Polyakov is made this original question.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the organism does not generate skeletal and muscular system.
To a newborn in orbit is impossible to dress it with a special suit for training as adults.
It is simply deprived of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment we are going to do together, to allow the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring the Earth to a disabled person, a person totally outdated", provides for the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKU Chief: inspection of the system "švarc" has failed to comply with the politician guilty
In the field of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application limps.
So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack", describes the current situation.
Joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, mentions of Petr Nečas attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" System.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb entrepreneurs with inspectors. Then, it is prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in this case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the performance of the Office having the obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on control in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German, in the framework of which compared the legislation concerning public contracts in both countries.
What exactly is?
It's a parallel control that we started to make some two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how it should organize public allotments, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country, and then the praxis itself.
We it have combined everything and, although control is not finished yet, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more comprehensive", however, some parameters in concrete praxis is better in Germany.
He is confirmed, therefore, that is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
In fact what you can this project provide? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this type might help that I stopped investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this has a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a thing suitable for a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, eventually, criminal actions.
But not by the fact of reducing the limit of the awards mean that we are going to get it.
Maybe it's because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to find faults in the system can do so more easily than if the limits remain as high as it is now.
You speak problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation regulating the practicaa of the public auction.
How does the system of controls in Germany?
It is similar to our NKU Office or is organized in a different way?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, there it acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court), with an organization similar to ours, with a college also, only thing is that if it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Competencies are also to some extent similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of audit are even at this level. In this regard it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of accounts (BRH) can control only the federal money, what we here call State funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are handled in the Federal Court.
In terms of local law, it is simpler than ours?
In general, I would not make a comparison without facts. However, Germany is still a model in some aspects, but can not point out exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That surely no, but, I repeat, I don't like doing this type of comparisons.
It goes without saying that even those countries that we took as a model must deal with a large number of problems.
If wasn't so not it would mean them no benefit to collaborate with our Office, don't you think?
In terms of the legislation of our country, what it mean for your Office the amendment of law on public contracts? Its incidence occurs in some way?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, yet not manifested in the actions of control.
Since we carry out controls ex post, must have a certain delay.
By now, is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have started a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, which have made passing nearly 14,000 public allotments, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the boundaries are changed, will rectify the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, involved a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations "hardens" and which is impossible to comply with it.
Already the previous regulations, controlled people were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional Council), with each law not respected in the field of public auction meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
It make sense then toughen the law in this way?
I think that not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack him or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no incidence in decision-making.
A system of this type will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how is out of this?
We'll see where it takes us this started way.
The Prime Minister has recently declared that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with the so-called švarc system controls, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does it mean?
Is švarc system"prohibited or permitted?
The law should be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the performance of the Office having the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say: "We change the law and allow it", but can not say that we will make as if nothing.
In the law on the public auction, the regulations are fairly strict in terms of how that should be done formally. And that's as it should be to protect the public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that it exclude the candidate with the best deal for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Highways are plates of ice, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic roads have plates of ice and snow.
Although most of the roads are passable, in some caution must be extreme.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning in the region of Karlovy Vary roads were passable, but they had plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day, they will slightly rise thermometers.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lowlands the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the crests of the Ore mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was poor because of fog, according to the information of the roads of the region operations control center.
The expressway R6 and the road of first category in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to use extreme caution, especially in some bridges whose surface can be icy and slippery.
Also, all avenues of second and third category, including the mountain roads are passable.
However, in some cases, there are still sections with remains of ice and compacted snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové region
On some roads in East Bohemia, there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains can have formed a layer of snow on the roads, reports in its pages the direction of roads and highways.
Operators of roads warned drivers about the danger forming ice plates, especially in higher areas of the region of Pardubice.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlici, Poličky, Svitav, or Vysokého Mýta, and above all on the roads of second and third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow, especially on the roads in the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There's a layer of packed snow on the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will be today between cleared and partially cloudy, no precipitation.
Temperatures generally ranging between three below zero and a positive degree, will blow a weak wind.
Pilsen region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today in the morning, although caution must always be followed and will need to adapt to the time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be Frost, temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent decline of temperatures, some way could also be covered with ice.
In some places, drivers will find themselves with fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is what is clear from the information provided by the roads of the region operations control center.
The D5 motorway is accessible almost without restriction, although it is recommended to use extreme caution, especially in the way between 80 and 131 km.
The majority of first-grade highways surface is dry and free of ice.
In the area of the border with Germany Tachov and Pilsen road there may be sections with plates of ice.
Second and third category pathways are wet, by which, in this case, also warns of stretches plates of ice.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less traveled roads in the area of Šumava.
Olomouc region
Drivers who are directed to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find snow partially dispose of.
After chemical treatment, still was snow in the port of Červenohorske and on the road in the direction of Videlsky kříž.
Road workers removed the snow during the night. on the road from Šumper accumulated about three inches of snow, according to administrators of the tract.
In the rest of the region, the majority of roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest zones of the Šumper road, there are remnants of snow.
"Drivers at the port of Červenohorske will find snow half dismisses direction Jeseník", has today confirmed an operative of the administration of Šumper to the ČTK road.
On the ground and at night attended the Jesenicka also colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the higher areas are now clear and wet.
In the Olomouc road routes are passable without restrictions, in the Šternberska drivers should drive with caution in the forest stretches, where routes are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region
The operators of the roads of Northern Bohemia have reported complications in different stretches first thing in the morning.
Apart from some places which has snowy or ice-cream, according to the database of police Road between Telnice, Knínice mountain in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lower areas, so that the ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and highways, are generally dry.
By the mmento complications of service have not been.
Road operators have been advised of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štěti.

The road between Telnice, Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched on the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: in our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month will reach the end of the world, what about it?
It is only one among many other alarming news like that grab us.
The music group The Tap Tap like us rather make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only group of world music that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
In addition, in December to organize a really original project: three concerts for the end of the world.
You explain it to readers?
It's a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the potential of marketing that has the end of the Mayan calendar stated on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time the end of the Mayan calendar in the Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
To who came you this idea?
It was initially my idea, after we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the State that the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar also have created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key chains against the end of the world can be found at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the called hymn against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, is you will hear in the charity concerts?
Of course, Yes, and be just the last, well, provided that everything goes well and the world is not finished...
All performers will sing it at the same time at three concerts.
Hymns are linked each other simultaneously thanks to the special broadcast live on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the role of Jesus in the video, where he also sang Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
We work together with other personalities from the cultural scene in Czech, apart from organising many charity events and concerts...
We put all our efforts in participating in this project.
It has shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts for the end of the world go?
Equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Jedličkův Tap ústav.
The students of the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly visited by teachers that are fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have the economic means to pay teachers and make an effort to make it possible.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building which we will move with this project.
In each concert they act several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, check out www.kpks.cz.
Do you have planned some other "spectacular"similar action in the future?
In May we will act for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here we will surely prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests.
Also coming year I would like to touch in the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I'd like to fill it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, wheelchairs must travel in the baggage compartment and in addition we carry much weight, boxes with instruments...
However, so far we have managed us well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, not to let something that surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where they have returned recently, left everything without problems.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the East, is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still not common that a person moves one by the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
There it is not something as current as it is, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair elevator.
Luckily, a civil association that strives to make the problems of persons with disabilities has been created.
In which aspects should we take example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we are going back...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid is very normal people with a severe disability to move on their own in public and can go to the service, the Museum, wherever...
But it is not very common to a large number of people with disabilities to participate in the social life in an active way, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap go a bit ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when it comes to which arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will begin to change everything really.
So far, are isolated cases of people who have a strong willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if you look a few years ago, what you did to form the group in 1998?
As an educator I entered Jedličkův ústav, where many young people had to my around wanting to dedicate himself to something.
And since I am a musician, toco, among others, saxophone, founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, left us a little hands (laughter).
However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that he helped us quite the fact connected with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that work not seen, is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to aid from the European Union, we cannot allow ourselves also teachers of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you have intention to get away with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that had, that anything can be done otherwise.
The entertainment industry is full of things that resemble each other.
Not surprisingly, in his own way, everything new is home gingerly and takes long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time clearly is compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because disabled people are not abandoned beings who suffer and that we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on condition, of course, that the necessary means available.
I always say if anything goes well to people with disabilities, then, is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that is you a demanding boss, as described by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think that it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the high school test, and spend much time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
Many of them were already at the beginning of the year 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open Group, people coming in and out, it cannot be avoided.
Anyone with the will and desire to always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday at 9 p.m. 20.12.2012
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, Plynojem in Ostrava and Brno Fleda and will participate in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
Three cities can be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the Group The Tap Tap song "End of the world, cancelled"
The concert aims to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the school without barriers STUDEO in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, whose cost amounts to CZK 25 million.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entrance at the option of advance sales at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency last week he accepted Poland as a twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member of that the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in the Commission of projects of the Agency.
However, the path of Poland toward the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts already engaged flights into space before the second world war, although their work is not always understood.
I remember, for example, the Conference of a. Šternfeld in the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw, on December 6, 1933, presented his ideas on the study "Introduction to cosmonautics" pioneer.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) let the audience indifferent, and years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch by his "Introduction to Astronautics" in France.
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, became later a great promoter of astronomy and Astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the dark side of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a draisine which would be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used for the start-up of the draisine or for its braking.
Information about this draisine is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From the year 1933 Polish artillery began to devote himself to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes evident that research came to the stadium for practice tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, stopped the investigation.
In 1937 he appeared in press and the prototype of a missile of photoelectric hunt designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba lotnicza i", of Leliwa-Krzywoblocki author.
Both projects were intended for military use of engines for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the Scientific Advisory Committee interim (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missiles for military use techniques and coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the onset of the war.
Other studies devoted to Astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The edition of November 1954 in the magazine Problemy refers first to the society with four extensive articles devoted to Astronautics.
One of them, prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to Astronautics.
At that time already had implemented projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the international Astronautics Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket that was carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and not reaching the 5 kg of weight.
Later, was it completed version RM-1A and air tests of the RM-2 rockets in two stages in the Błędów desert began in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 meters and weighed in at about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development would be subject to actual scientific study. RM-34 rocket would have a height of 14.5 km and its mission was to control height wind.
However, the works were suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a rocket in two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (called Meteor-1A, - 1B and - 1 c), differing among themselves by the space available for scientific equipment.
In the Meteor-1A rocket available volume space was 0.4 litres, 0.34 liters Meteor-1B and the Meteor-1 c of 0,62 litres.
The maximum height in three types was of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 was developed at the Institute of air rocket Meteor-2, whose first air tests were initiated in October 1970.
Meteor-2 rocket was a starting weight of 380 kg and capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor - 2 H and Meteor-3 version was built later.
It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR Committee two years later.
In the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law social traabajos.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in the society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that various economic forms and national economic systems are permanent conflict each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with the rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of salaries) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and this "causes a bajadda" of the price of the competitor in order to take over most of the market and, thus, increase their profit margin.
Large scale means, for most employers, move production abroad, buy there more cheaply or even disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour in comparison with other economies, is higher.
Since private capital has no social responsibility any and, thereby, nor is responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, necessarily grows the social expenditure of the State.
This entire situation conducive to the total disinterest of the businessmen to pay taxes, and offset economic and social damage that has provoked in an effort to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally as known to is not necessary to submit specific statistics.
Situations, is created by the unscrupulous practices of private capital in certain economies, in which the Governments of such countries are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of the population and, thus, attract foreign capital to the country.
Put another way, the Governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is evident especially in the changes of existing laws.
The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, using the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor.
Since a number of years ago, exist in Germany points of delivery of food to poor people who can not keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving such aid already reaching one million.
In the context of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employees with a salary so low that the State must pay the rest to reach the absolute minimum to survive.
A scandal of this type relating to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal Parliament became public.
Virtually all the States of the South of the EU saving measures drive, without doubt, the same situation. People, pressed by a huge decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with a lousy salary on the edge of society, in the hope that someday reach the private investor capital country.
Is necessary to preguntrarse comes from where?
In the event that in the case of other countries in the EU, then poverty passes from one country to another or doesn't ever since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a fraction of the European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim over and over again that the State should not provide capital to the economy, steering the economy leading to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the State should not intervene in the economy to meddling in the control.
It is then necessary to wonder whether private capital not influences with his selfishness in the political progress and, therefore, throughout the State.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent, practice in all States.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in the mutual favors, on legislation which is practically condemned everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, lack of financial means, responsible for the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to the industry.
This type of bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
In this way, all power not emanates from the people, as advertised in the constitutions of Western democracies, but the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation how which describes Appianos in his book the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "the State had long disintegrating and administrations occupied by force".
In Exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and helps to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without impediment and people went to the polls with the vote agreed beforehand... "there were people with character who aspire to a position in the Administration, so once, because of this disruption, the State was eight months without consuls"... "He began to talk seriously of the autocracy was the only remedy for a bad situation and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and became autocracy democracy forever.
The conclusion, in the same way as in antiquity, is that today's society relies on inconsiderate preferences of individual profit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as the then, decline of the elite record, without that an effort be made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and Communist regimes seek, therefore, in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a democracy of liberal types, such as a definite pause, waiting for the next hit.
The really damning fact is that current elite ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is to concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the participation of State capital and influence of citizens in Government and which undermine the monopoly position of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (No surge nothing of violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in the year 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, have sprung up, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favour of the right of self-defence and typecast to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleged racism by the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and stigmatizes a terrorist State Israel.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation, and did not live the beginning of violence.
My intention is to provide readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of tensions being dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, other conclusions which I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the topic, about who or which group of people is the main promoter of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of struggles for power is at Ringside.
Each time we find an Alexander the great or a Napoleon.
But what isn't so obvious is if these characters were always who directed his steps independently or if behind his throne, there was someone who aimed their actions toward a particular goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this implies, has not been able to arrive in a single generation.
These astronomically wealthy families include one that could be considered the most prominent (if there are still someone back, I don't know, but I do not rule out it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written close to them.
Naturally.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first News Agency (Reuters) to stop associating his name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered them shoulders, thing that they always meant a fortification.
They have important stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries which are not represented, declared or is preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, after overthrow Gaddafi only four remained, but meanwhile Russia has subject the central bank to the Russian Government.
Anyone who tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the civil war to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve (FED) system and he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting to sue the fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of the year 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Albert Pike mason, awarded to the 33rd degree.
The first war was marked aimed to eliminate the large Royal States throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Great Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the Earth's population between half a million and one billion people (like number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for similar solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with which operates the richest families, along with the Rothschild Group, follows the dynamics of the outbreak of the crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong, and always involve a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that no repeat of a crisis as the year 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, risking the first world war, destroyed the Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly and unjustified from the point of view military and economic, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end with the Tsarist Russia were now unnecessary) and the further dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the second world war, allowed that the bankers and politicians create, in stealth mode, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, which created optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough them to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out to guilty, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities with a strong German minority which should represent and represented as well the role of the fifth column, which lit the flame and led to the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild led to the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of the old Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above paved the way for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled the rope to which international bankers had it tied at first or if everything he did was part of a plan too. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish State in the global society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way that war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers got to start it, the Jewish nation, like that in the second world war, become victim at first line of combat, now together with the population Arabic or, usually, Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of their country, but also on an international scale. Take for example how are divided so emphatic supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in a spiral of violence interminable, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its agents because, as it happens in our country, international bankers have only their candidates in elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal to the international bankers, politician who makes everything possible to declare war on Iran, and considering that they Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and if we take into account that they Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil (navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under which light will now display the words that gave David Rockefeller in 1994: "the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population served by a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated.
A world in which each new individual is implanted him a chip at birth that he controls his entire being.
"And forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be marked in the right hand or on his forehead, to not be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of your name."
It is necessary to understand it: anyone with half a brain, which add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks a person and this number is six hundred threescore and six".
Argo film: If it is crude, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the manifestation of Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release would be in Exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which, after the revolution, fled to the United States.UU, which had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive Outlook: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since if he did so, he endangered the confidence of partners in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the United States.UU., his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter front Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The "Argo" of director and actor Ben Affleck Film puts an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the Embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, got out of Iran, this helped a covert history a quirky point: went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan which charted the "exfiltration" Toni Mendez expert required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem truthful, he wrote about the film project in journals, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company had even a real Office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has become from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; another, called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, moods are combined. On the one hand are well-documented sequences of Tehran. The credits sequence shows iconic photographs from the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; There are not many differences in this regard.
By the other, typical scenes of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes of the central of the CIA and other institutions: men suits that analyze the situation at the table of negotiations, in the halls of the Office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been subject to ridicule, has become a respectable director and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film, after "Little bye, bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves"(2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck in which action has no place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that located to old movies above standards of Hollywood directors.
And Affleck shows in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the Embassy is impressive by its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the excitement of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (team imposter in the Tehran Bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And manages quite well. Sometimes adds something to the reality: here does not leave everything so so smart (the scene in which lurks the crisis at Tehran airport, deviating from a call to America and rampant after his track search become insane).
The weakness of Argo is the lack of control arising from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny as collaborators of Hollywood role, although their characters deserved more space and are not, nor much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck Film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that you can continue with a moderate interest, assess their implementation and style retro of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But that collapse, that will be difficult.
As evocation of a true story and as proof of the exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules to inflate balloons, banana and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas from the workshop of the EU".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans approved a quota of 40 per cent of women in management in large European companies", said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unifying the insurance contracts between men and women.
So far, women was nailbiting best prices on life insurance because they objectively represent one lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at end of February 2013 ", reported Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the compulsory addition of biocomposites fuel which, as a result, harms the environment environment; Another prohibition is the use of life mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or guideline sombre the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
He has been criticized factual prohibition of use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb retailers.
A banana of quality must have a length of 14 cm.
The appliance of the Union takes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by any State or group of States (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claiming the demands of their banks).
A lobby interests were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 cm in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended saying this only seeking harmonise national rules not homogenized so far, just complicating your marketing.
The rules that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some States, have softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the EU last year according to which in the inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years old are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU made reference here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by suffocation.
Also existing is a similar restriction applicable to the use of Tuesday's children up to 14 years.
Strange occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone having any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To not offend the sensibilities of Greece, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnipoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, some absurd proposals referred to above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of the food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic the same day from our entry to the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, volume set for mushrooms canned, which earned him a threat of substantial fine.
Also interested to the organizers of the survey the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for grant application.
This kind of ideas arose not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage by not having sea.
We ask the EU compensation", said in fall 2004 the then Minister of agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued it with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention buying, the State had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of the grain of the countries that have no access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of requests for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often target of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations, also operation and development more effective throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the payment of grants from the EU for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have to chord, in the same way that other countries of the Union, fighting for the right to the designation of origin of its traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the cheese of Olomouc, but had to change the name to national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of appellations of origin, protected from the EU, together with the cheese feta and gorgonzola known around the world, from the German city Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, are already for example cookies of Karlovy Vary, carp Pohořelice and of Třeboň and, even, the variety of hops from Žatec.
As cameras protected from the EU can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the waffles of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how it occurred to him to present to the election for President?
It is not to be Senator or President.
If everything in our country, then he would not my candidacy.
But now I can not stand to see how steals in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions of being a politician.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a Senator or President.
The Senate it has already arrived, but shortly thereafter has been on the road to the Presidency.
Is it not giving back to those who have voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the Presidency depended on the results in the election of the Senate.
I later stated that if he was elected Senator, he would present my candidacy for the Presidency.
But my goal is not function; the function is the tool with which my own ideas can make reality.
Why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or in front of the television, but we drive to anyone who wants to initiate a change.
In this addition to the media, you discrediting and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
Me it is said I bribed journalists or that I have been Advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It occurs to the presidential fight with thesis financial and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the Declaration of the property above 20 million.
To do this you must change the law.
As President does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a group of pressure so that guide nursing recognized as autonomous work, and we got it.
The problem is the policy: If someone arrives with a good proposal, either right-wing or left-wing, it is rejected by the way and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, have a greater potential to obtain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without prejudices and dogmas of party, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Considered rather a man right-wing or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people I consider more than left-wing.
For me it doesn't matter, whether it's a bit of left-wing or right-wing.
What matters to me is that we go forward.
I don't care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite the people.
Always support openly any good solution, regardless of if the proposal comes from the KSČM or from the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
It makes joke when we say you that it is populist.
But it is not showing it with what it says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak already run the world or known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the Parliament there only are slogans.
And thus cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if it is directed at people and talk to them, will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to get it.
If you were elected President, there would be no problem to organize a live broadcast on TV in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties they legitimize the criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and State prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why you do not want to.
If there is a strong character who says disputes, can be pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the President, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I'm just a fan, I'm not a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and try to obtain the greatest possible support for my program.
I try to take things forward myself, but should not leave well, within six years I will leave it and return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit as if Okamura to save the Czech Republic.
No I'm no Savior.
I know that with a person I do not do anything, so I have visited a number of well known personalities, if maybe they are encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported journalist Jana Lorencová research, which brought to light the light from heating oils fraud.
Myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did voted in representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, are two of the independent sector.
The people elected the Senate, in such a way that it will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, like for example the direct election of mayors and Governors.
Are you considering to form his own party?
Even I have not considered it because I don't have time for this, to check the past unblemished from each of the potential members of the party, or do not have money.
I don't have money for the campaign for the Presidency, there are only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
Don't have money?
Speaking of declarations of the property, how is yours?
I think my private property at $ 60 billion.
In Prague, I have land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artwork with a value of ten million, Aston Martin of some 3.5 million and a Superb valued at one million, and in the account Škoda I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting against the iniquities and injustices.
Driving an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You says that you want to change the Republic but does not want to put too much money on your part.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow me?
In the campaign, I've already 2.5 million.
The fact that it does not have any sponsor demonstrates that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
Campaign expenses covered in essence what you will receive in respect of Senator salary.
But he could not live it. For example, it could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly crowns.
If you only wanted to make money, then I would not pursue as a candidate.
So it will continue with its business activity to live?
Not has it said before that he was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with one higher salary.
As I have promised, partly I have stopped my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People would like to be the Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
As it is customary to win monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I'm still gaining.
If you were President, then I would leave the business.

The architecture MVRDV Studio shows that not only true adventures are in the head - the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and finally have something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who passed down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, tecnico de TI in a large company located near the library, says: "in addition, the building is beautiful".
But I ask for what we need a library today.
All have Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters by taste in those libraries, old fashioned, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city situated at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious distinction of having won a record for forgetting.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the Netherlands lower literacy rate.
To counteract this so embarrassing, some years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy seven fictitious bridges that are represented in the euro banknotes in the form of decorated concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And it was as the responsible politicians decided that there was only a possibility to improve the statistics: there was to build a library!
Winy Maas, the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and head of fun buildings while cynics, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed at its around and it shrank from shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "dear fellow citizens:"
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg' "."
Nine years later, EUR 30 million mountain rises in the intended place.
It is part of the revitalization project, which comes complete with an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town devoid of story, which to date had nothing more to offer that a postmodern pedestrian area and a city incredibly ugly behind whose facade one white intuiría rather a central Dairy now boasts a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a haven of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is a lift which transports us right at the center of this massif, but real lovers of space and reading don't use it, they prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climbing to the top.
The all-glass interior is bright and easy to cover with the tab, annealed brick floors and elegant lanterns support unequivocally the public status of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Boost view can be displayed the park benches, the dogs and the children playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"The shelves of books are usually arranged along the facade and in the Centre opens a huge dark room which, in general, tends to be somewhat inconvenient and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we are we've done put upside down the classical spatial configuration and take the reading from the inside to the outside area.
The interior of the mountain is very well spent: in the middle are offices, the Internet Library, chess club, environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and balustrade at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers, more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse.
And so as a day, on a farm frize, we stumbled upon the right coming from agriculture by-product.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands used a woven plastic of few millimeters thick as a base to hold the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
This tissue is crimped to the library, for the first time in such amounts, until four inches thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a dark, uniform and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps, we reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous road about 500 meters around the mountain ahead of us the reward: from the coffee shop not only has a fantastic view of the city, but that it also can enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its planted huge potted ficus.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time maintaining the humidity adequate for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Hard to believe it given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project with regard to ecology", says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
While books mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the Sun only shines during few hours inside.
The massive wooden trusses situated transversely to the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the Sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, skeptical of the information technologies sector worker, already has dared to set foot on the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration which took place a couple of weeks ago were invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book from his private collection.
In this way is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that still does not have its full file; It currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has permeated deep.
The shelves are packed with.
"There is nothing worse than a library half empty", says the architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although only is there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV Studio has achieved a success in that discipline Queen who specialized slang known as "creating an identity".
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young and uneducated to be.
Finally a starting point to shape its identity.
Szabó: "Germans should play a role more"
Germany had abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on us-China relations. USA-Europe, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany hinted that he would vote against the proposal to grant the status of an observer State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally declined.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time I believe that it also supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when that issue was to establish a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when they are important international issues at stake?
Yes, so.
This is due to that currently it is refocusing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy-led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And making it even more difficult things is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing it.
I think they are still groping to what will be their role, but they have already started a foreign policy towards "normal".
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What you mean specifically a 'normal' foreign policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions other than the United States or its European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e., in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote on the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
This is why you must be careful and not to alienate the Arab public opinion nor the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I do not give so much importance since it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, if they play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Germany undermined their relationship with us. UU. to abstain from voting on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think a break so drastic as in the case of Libya has occurred.
Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain a certain respect.
Finally and ultimately this has only demonstrated that it is a country take that seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, us. UU. It has been clearly in favour of a veto.
There is disparity of views between us.? UU. and many European Nations?
There have always been these disparities due to American domestic politics.
I think that the Obama administration shows a great understanding toward the European position secret.
But, because of the political situation it is living here, is clear that the Government cannot defend in public that position.
I think the real disparity of opinions does not actually the importance attached to it.
If we analyze the relationship between Obama and israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusiastic about politics that develops.
It is difficult to reconcile Germany close relations maintained with Israel and United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that it is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course that would be a little easier for Germans if there is a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a greater entity, but it must promote things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I think that Germany will assume a leadership role when it comes to force Europe to adopt a European stance in the future.
Of course that this is not easy for Germany, whether simply by the relationship that it has with Israel.
This has always been a tricky issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
See Germany itself in the role of an important international actor? You would in reality Germany assume a leading role?
Do or perhaps continues finds it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany have not been used, is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing play a more important role.
If we look at the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a major player, certain antialemanes feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies.
Seen in this way, Germany is a lot more difficult than United States position.
You have to show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
The influence of the United States. UU. in European policy decreases more and more, but the EU does not cover of time that vacuum, who is left then?
It will not be the Germans no choice but to assume a role more protagonist.
Even if you don't like them, if you find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani have become suddenly Chinese brands
Armani is also a known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren.
But, what Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but that it has nothing to do with the original Companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not present a demand.
And even then it is not clear that they go to give the reason.
"The foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect its brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of rights of protection in extreme East.
Each week comes to my table a new case.
Imitators just added a couple of letters to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sporting goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a Cabinet where he keeps Beijing Trademark Office seats.
On September 14, 2010 a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name brand that also served the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are world champions in that copy and violate the rights of intellectual property is well known.
In big cities there are stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of fakes.
However, Pattloch cases are otherwise. On behalf of its customers, he fights against the fact that the Trademark Office grants the right to capitalize on a name that is already registered in another place in an official way to Chinese companies.
The Chinese called it "Bang Ming Pai" or brand Companion.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
that refers to women who have "fished" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is harmful to the business, they must fight against it requires Pattloch.
"The brand does not hold water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially iconic luxury products.
According to data from the Chinese company's market analysis CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year is, in size, the third market of luxury goods, and which grows to greater pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the register of marks is difficult and also means lots of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the Court dismissed a lawsuit because he had spent so long that the name object demand already had become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff has bad luck, may even have to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged this brand in China", says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by German manufacturer of Schwing concrete pumps.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, was used at the beginning a logo in white and blue that largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter is settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile facing in the direction opposite to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO in Beijing Trademark Office recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal".
In this way, the amount of claim without processing processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending.
Fight against this costs lots of money
As it is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, nearly one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the new inscriptions on the world list, for the tenth consecutive year according to the Trademark Office.
It seems that this also occurs with the number of valid logos, figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011 it would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Fight against this cost much money, as evidenced by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
More than seven years the Group fights a Chinese copycat in the courts.
Even though the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts,
imitator has managed to make sure Chinese rights on the trademark Freudenberg.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the appeal of the Munich.
In the following two instances have given him reason to Freudenberg, but the other party is still fighting today.
You must be very careful
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where he is still pending.
Wentzler relies on to favorably resolve the issue and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also says that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the enterprise archive has had to review records of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered a "six-digit euro sum" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement to the opposing party, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much that matters," says Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the far East threaten even with affect Europe,
specifically if imitators sure there not protected trademark rights.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products in Germany.
Long ago the Group abandoned this trade, however attained prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommended German companies are extremely cautious when it comes to doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights legislation, but is what you need to do "also recorded in China everything that may be eligible for protection", as it aims Wentzler.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, where Freudenberg lost the final round of their particular battle, then it would have to pay to the other party licensing rights by their own name, as it explains Wentzler.
That or in the segment in question we expel market.
The world day against AIDS: dancing, singing, help
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and happy to the AIDS orphans in Swaziland
The story of a link able to overcome much more than 8.733 km away.
First start for dance:, cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and loafers looking the compass on the parquet floor, and found it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of singers (Alto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, hindering it and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to leave almost their boxes while trying to place order with their energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music of the psychology Institute Heidelberg medical room Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also reached from the human geneticist to the master of House.
"Om'Obani' is not an easy piece, each voice choir has a different and also in a foreign language hardly known text: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate from UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Association Voices for Africa has been found in Germany godparents for 180 the Esitjeni village AIDS orphans.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover tuition for school uniform and will guarantee you a warm meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in zulu "storyteller" or "panegyrist" means.
In this room nobody knows this bantu language fluent, but sing know.
Ten years ago this choir rehearses songs in this soft language that occasionally manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 Km of straight-line distance from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on this German choir voices.
Forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what it affects Swaziland: more AIDS infection rate high and the lowest life expectancies around the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that it has shown it halved the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir found this hidden population, but what they saw mostly were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and education.
No school title, the possibilities in a poor country are scarce.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of some few which made it possible that a child off to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the Association "Voices for Africa" which since then has dealt professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The ETS of bacterial origin include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common Viral STD are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among STD transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute part of the base that at least four of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases are infections by chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
The spread of HIV between heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; However, approximately 20% of all new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among the young, chlamydial infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections remains a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
It's one-tenth less than in the previous year.
Do symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital tract, discomfort while urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend to regularly undergo medical examinations, especially if frequently change of sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, the majority of STDs can be cured and is possible to avoid any late result.
Through partnerships, donations, and last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for performances in all Germany, arrive to raise enough money.
"In total have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says proud Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the own town Zodwa Dlamini a woman sure of herself and with leadership manages the money sent from Germany.
It deals with the orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as it is called to the older Zulu women, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in her charge, offer a roof to live and deal with that children attend school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone left under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 children hungry, collecting a salary from the Association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, has built two houses and, in collaboration with the organization health American PSI, has managed that many of the inhabitants of the town have undergone an HIV test.
This is not something obvious, since, despite the obvious is this disease throughout the country, is usually not talking openly about it.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Something strange in a country where the King is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its full of excesses and opulent lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This way of life not formally accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But also due to the numerous seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to another and carrying it beyond where van.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
It is another culture, here only accept contact skin against skin ".
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southern tip of the African continent still remind of the apartheid era.
A bus full of white singing songs in a language of blacks; such recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and great joy, but it has also managed to extract a couple of tears to some another rabid border soldier.
The journey leads them always to Esitjeni, where singers visited to sponsored children.
While this small population barely appear on maps, in the Valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Approaching Esitjeni, there shines the light", says the people of the place.
And after the 8.733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the singers with the Bergheimer Street rehearsal rooms marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see your light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the Sun, there also there is ice water, as are the conclusions of three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow a layer of ice has formed.
It seems that this has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from kites or, with great probability of asteroid which collided against mercury.
Nobody relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the head of the probe, Messenger, Sean Solomon researcher.
The temperature on mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help clarify how they have come to the water and other components of life elsewhere in the solar system.
Completely silently for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots as the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: small Windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that comprise our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, rotating around the Sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which countless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although more difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called little romantically by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away.
This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of material that Star spits in their process of extinction.

The Helix nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It lies 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.

One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image posted by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located thousands of light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "dendropanax" (divided into three), since a dark lines of dust divided the burning heart of this star-forming region into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus astronomers could photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million years Earth light nuclei of the two galaxies in the process of fusion is leap one towards the other to finish crashing irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to her with the nickname of grinder Austral.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The Nebula located 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than the particles of dust that can be found in a House.
This image was created based on optical imaging and x-rays made by different telescopes.
Displays a ring of black holes located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, served for a time of model for the NASA Hubble space telescope.
The scientists called the spiral galaxy's largest UGC 1810.
This Nebula is the Group's brightest young stars of our Milky way.
This star-forming region constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, also new arise continuously star; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this Galaxy so bright with a small black hole yet there is no dust, gas only.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found on all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, until Galileo Galilei used it a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and the images that we offer have increasingly more depth.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale located in el Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
Your mirror, pictured, had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, USA. UU., stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa mirror is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches approximately 11 meters in diameter.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so that their mobility is limited.
Texas Hobby-Eberly telescope also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a diameter of comparatively smaller mirror, such capacity is comparable to the of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI for its acronym in English), it can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope may also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
THAT will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or extremely large European telescope).
Its primary mirror will comprise 42 meters and consists of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck Telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors, each one of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, that together explore the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Mauna Kea are planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of thirty-meter mirror.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 NASA announced that from the beginning of his mission had localized 1.235 candidates for planets.
Pictured are the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
This space telescope primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will be seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers infer that at the South Pole of mercury, there is also ice.
However, there is no evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first that orbit around mercury, now scientists have the certainty that it is so.
Drinking butter daily and live 168 years
To the South of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum devoted to longevity.

To the South of Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum devoted to longevity.
A search of footprints in a country in which 97 people are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with a great crash through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of large flow and simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one could even think that it is in the black forest.
However, we are in the most southern part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers.
Here live the "talyshi", a town that is not much, apart from the fact that perfectly dominate the Persian and azeri and are long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too solid designed in the Soviet era and that doesn't seem to fit at all in a picturesque hilly landscape.
European tourists only come to this place, since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To navigate the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centres, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing richness is the oil of the Caspian Sea country still has not come to this hidden region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik have what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in may on the occasion of the celebration of the Festival of Eurovision and next year we will celebrate the Festival of people more elderly women of the world," says Fatulayeva.
The only one that exists in the world is the Director of the Museum of longevity, perhaps.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozens of talyshis of the place over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
Her son died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the Museum is the pastor of sheep Şirali Muslumov, who seems to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate certifying it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslumov age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. He apparently still had time to conceive one daughter closer to the age of 136.
Has Şirali Muslumov at his age then wrong in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also has heard the elderly this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan, or in the Valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live very elderly," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence regarding the age; especially when there is no civil registry.
Everyday glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequent way, the inhabitants of the region located around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 people that exceed 100 years of age.
Do you live here, in the South, so many elderly people?
Farid Mugimzadeh azeri tour guide explains that you it's the special genes of the talyshis.
The Director of the Museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the power.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems not logical that precisely the diet rich in calories of talyshi, love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which, in addition, drink a cup of melted butter, every day is so healthy.
Or is perhaps the form of natural life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
97-Year-old is relatively young for what is the style in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple House of typical wood of the region of the Caucasus.
Sitting on the floor, moves in a tireless way a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
They also jump from one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, tea serving in some typical vessels with rounded shape.
Mirzayeva teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the headscarf conceals two long braids of dark blond hair that her son we see proud.
Always I have washed the hair with milk, that never has been dropped me and has kept its color.
"Nor I have ever used a shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough for living
Always eaten only what they produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life I have not gone never shopping at a supermarket.
Then speaks of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-WWII era.
However, everything turned on track when the "Dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of one elderly woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that professes itself to the paternal figure of the nation, who runs your country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
This remained in power until 2003, moment in which gave witness to his son Ilham.
At least older people of Azerbaijan do not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in respect of monthly pension, an amount that you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the grizzled son of Mirzayeva is right: "in our culture, elders are well respected".
They live in a large family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if that wasn't reason enough to stay alive many years...
The Constitution is missing the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as the basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian President did not spare in pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility before the people and before God,"said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Coptic Christians, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular ones.
All of them, plunged hopelessly far into a confused opposition, afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As explained by Mohammed Mursi, almost begging for forgiveness, he has had to cancel temporarily the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expand their own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the world know very well what this engineer's 61-year-old with a degree of doctorate awarded by the University of Southern California wants to really save.
Do aims to deprive of his power to the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent Assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a night meeting of 15 hours of duration, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also said that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that "principles"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will exploit this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway that entails, to impose a more strict interpretation of sharia.
This is at least suggesting a new article added: in all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult the University al - Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islamism.
You don't have to be like that, but it may mean that the clergy would monitor legislation, something that - indeed - would result in the impairment of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is open to interpretation
Also problematic is that it intended to keep the military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exercise a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As established in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote your morals and values".
It's a so vague formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, State institutions could even control the content of the film and literature.
Speaking clearly is not another thing that's censure.
By the way that no article states explicitly the equality between men and women.
On the other hand other prohibited offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.
However, is not clear what is an offense and how it has to be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits "the offense to people"
It is enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, as many other things in the draft which has been presented to Mursi for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution has gone"
Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on the afternoon of Friday at the Cario Tahrir square and vowed to derail the Act until it can enter into force.
"Revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the lists for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft Constitution should be "in the dustbin of history".
Via Twitter, he blamed followers of Mursi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When you call the referendum we will go to his palace and derrocaremos it," said Jasser Said opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not been atoned," is quoted in the Egyptian media opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that not they wanted to monitor the referendum, would therefore not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community appealed to hold a counter-demonstration; If not in Tahrir square, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and the Salafists supporters took part in the same shouting: "people requires the application of the divine law".
They demanded to Mursi "clean the country", at the same time that proclaimed: "The Quran is our Constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir square, where it started, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that something like this happened.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those who are opposed to the draft Constitution as supporters of the same would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people to decide at the polls what address should follow the country.
In this sense, seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human rights' does not even appear."
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process which actually should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces.
This 48-year-old lawyer specialized in human rights and President of the Egyptian Organization of human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to deal with a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because for the human rights are indivisible.
For this reason, he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human rights' does not even appear in the new Constitution," complains in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of competences of Mursi to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resignara is.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is to abolish it," laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot work without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against her.
A protester in Tahrir square warns: "you are conceiving a monster that you can not control".
The Norwegian rakfisk: the more smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible the success of the country to keep any relationship with their eagerness for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of overly mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet soccer clothing.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of the rakfisk, one of the delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The scenery is spectacular and that scent, always present, fleet in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in salt that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on the foul-smelling you prefer, up to one year.
As it gets dark and becoming more cold, the Norwegians flock in droves to a festival that is celebrated here, fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy as, so to speak, captivating.
"Eaten raw and then a glass of aquavit a drink is drunk," says Havard Halvarsen, firefighter of the city which is also what is known as the "General of the Rakfisk", which is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking a drink significant amounts of the beverage.
"Some people like it more the aquavit to the rakfisk", says Håvard.
Beverage can kill the odor.
I try some chunks.
If you can avoid passing near the nose, is not bad; It is not very different to a lot of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty beat Norway and in it that, before there was refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in winter, when it is well fermented, it removed and obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, eats.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly emigrated to United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until it is not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, integral, although quite smelly, past Norway.
It is located between the most expensive dishes that you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer shank or a sandwich cost you a whopping of £ 10 ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear in the agenda of the international news, and like the majority of Norwegians so.
Here people still are little willing to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist extreme right which Longbow shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
The Norwegians costs them a lot believe that in his quiet country one of theirs was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the beginning of the 1970s, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why going as well," says Anna, our waitress, while passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blonde hair and stunning blue eyes, representing the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you say you, wise people".
His English, as most of people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we dislike the ostentation".
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special benefit of the future generations Fund.
While everyone was dissipating money that did not have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed.
"While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm in the snow lining up to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a Moose Burger is definitely something different and quite succulent taste.
But at night, it becomes that smelly fish.
The hotel where I stayed is one of the many venues in which held a dinner of rakfisk in which Diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the more puts to the test the nostrils.
A television connected live with a presenter carrying bow and that is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It seems the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish there up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our scoring, Håvard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls out of Chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or they may be fumes from all the fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a hard start
As the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take up his post, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, examines the challenges that will face the new President and the different expectations of their people.
The traffic in the city of Mexico is especially bad currently.
In a city which, in the best of circumstances, is already in itself congested, installed since Monday a fence that cut through several of the main roads leading to the city and that is causing a huge chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent that workers could get to their place of work, but avoid that the demonstrators could reach Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation.
Faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing Government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against the narcotrafco which has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government is committed to great with the Mexican people reduce violence," explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the United States President, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before hobnobbing with the President of the United States.UU., Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
A very populous state with a fast-growing, which surrounds the capital. Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it reminds you with affection.
Residents attributed the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and building infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by a new road of Mr. Peña Nieto, which means an enormous improvement compared to the roads full of potholes that were rehabilitated and cracked.
You can also see plates with your name at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change.
"We hope that he gets to make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, Member of the partido de el Sr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, in regards to security and economy, we expect interesting and real change that our country so much needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, within the party there many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the description of which the opposition's lack of essence of the new President.
"He is a man very sincere, very committed and with an excellent view of the country.
He is a great man of State and, above all, is a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the State that is not the impression that many people have about their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated sections of motorway is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year was requested the intervention of the military so that they help in the fight against the gangs of drug in the neighborhoods and the violence against women is particularly serious.
On a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the State of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the Governor, a much higher rate than the of Ciudad Juarez, sadly famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with killings of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto critics say, in the best of cases, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in Office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete House, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back the tears as he shows me photographs of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to his house, seemed as if they had cleaned her body," remembers the Lady Buendía.
"There were signs that had been hit and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observed from the walls, along with a cross which reads only one word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says that he has denied.
"The State authorities have treated me as if it were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a quejica.
What they want is that one simply accept what they say and that is Street".
"But that cannot be so when have there been so many irregularities and such negligence," says.
The presidential sash to the President Peña Nieto received Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised to give priority during his tenure.
"I hope that it is the same type of President that was when he was Governor," says Deputy PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of city Neza more fear.
Bradley Manning reported no ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuses of Bradley Manning while in prison
The trial focuses on the period from Manning in the prison military Quantico in Virginia
The Defense wants to dismiss the case on the basis that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of further filtering of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce abuses that now alleges that he suffered while he was under military detention.
During the interrogation the Prosecutor made to Manning in a preview to the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Comandante Ashden Fein said that records of weekly visits by officers of the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, VA., don't show any complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the request from the defence that dismissal of the case given that his incarceration had been hard and that it already had been enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was detained.
The intelligence analyst for the army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has not never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum confinement regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers have asked questions to Manning and annotated answers.
When Friday asked Fein about the forms, Manning acknowledged that it had qualified treatment that gave keeper as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaint of ill-treatment, while officers Manning asked directly about the treatment who received, said Fein.
Manning responded that it had expressed its concern about some issues and that officers who visited him had discussed those problems and had indicated that they would seek, but they left no record of the registration issues.
"They wrote 'uneventful' (after having spoken of the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I have not mentioned any problem", said Manning.
The judge, Colonel of the army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting which took place in January 2011 with a Council charged with examining the intentions of suicide had expressed in a form months before.
Manning responded that it was his intention during that meeting the of the reduction of the "prevention of injury" regime under which was.
The military said that they had put him under this restrictive regime, which is a grade below the monitoring by possible suicide, to ensure their protection and the safety of others.
"You wanted the staff to know that I was OK and (want to) stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy that, from my point of view, is a better life," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the base of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness because of the heat.
He said that the fact of not being allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to the Arafjon camp, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said, once transferred to Quantico, passing most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said only was allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and sunglasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said that he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while he slept.
He said that if wardens could not see her face when the turn it was night, they woke him to come back to turn around.
The lawyer of Manning presented a formal complaint about the treatment I received Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to prison military Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April.
On Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation that had made the Declaration on Thursday, according to which, after a night being forced to sleep naked in his cell of Quantico, was forced during a morning count to remain standing desdnudo in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that never has had given him the opportunity to cover with a blanket during the count.
During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said that he deduced by the order that gave the caretaker that should drop the blanket that covered could have been, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified Thursday that had forced him to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger for itself.
Manning said that I had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops for self-harm but that it had not done so.
Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his underwear, his flip flops and sunglasses.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge consider at least experiences that happened during your stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence when he was convicted at the court-martial, which is scheduled to start at the beginning of the coming year.
The defense said that it is planning to make Manning declared guilty of misdemeanors and defend other considered too extreme accusations.
It is expected that the view resumes this weekend and expected prosecutors to argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the implementing rules to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning included cooperation with the enemy, cause of illegally publishing information on the Internet, filtering of information of national defense and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; He says that they remind Mexicans of those hard times
Feastday says the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to the city of Mexico, he had just gone down the Esplanade and arrived in the area of immigration processing and was completely confused.
Some posters indicating the road to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure to where it should go.
Having grown up in Central California, during my whole life have called me "Mexican".
It is ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York qualify themselves "Italians".
Later I decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in the homeland of my grandfather, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
It was just us.
I speak Spanish. It sufficiently well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native level and I can not rid myself of my American accent.
So I took my passport and I got in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at that time of the week in which the President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always that the leaders of these two countries, consisted: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment is as likely that a Mexican stay in Mexico that he ventures to go to the United States.
You want to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to keep fighting against the the drug cartels in Mexico, although it gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of rancor.
Probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to give up half of his territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that recall it is are everywhere.
So, at the moment in which an officer of the United States says anything that carries the slightest critical to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are on war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship really posed a challenge is they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Shall we talk about grudge?
There is so much.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for which the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not so.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, one person, can that the father or mother or one of the grandparents, that closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, educated under, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and are loyal to them.
To Mexico do not.
And, while perhaps we are now living the American dream, to have gone to good schools and have had good jobs, not we can lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, and not Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that not like many Mexicans belong to the elite of the ruling class.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over his shoulder as if we were of a lower grade that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they had not gone.
And now not we would be trapped behind this curtain of silk, well living in the United States, but even so, as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this friction between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know more solidly to who they are and seconds this bothers them.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either of the two.
We love hearing the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted any of them.
In Mexico we are as Americans.
And in the United States we considered Mexican.
Now, to further complicate things, so I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as "ambassadors" of Mexico improvised, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our American colleagues fantasy that is visiting that country and presionaríamos political leaders so they strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, clear...
That won't happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and violence by drug, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you are going to be alone with this idea, friends.
It is just.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which treated Mexico a century ago and a half, then have that accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful for how was your family makes a lot less time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
May a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East one day be?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the usual and futile discussions over who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time from Gaza missiles have fallen close to Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything that surrounds them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it all done pieces them like it or not, Israelis and Palestinians have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal deadlock situation could get.
A war that neither loses nor WINS
At first glance, the optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.
Even if the high fire agreed on 21 November, clashes this week have strengthened hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, while Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and put pressure to the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated on the planet, Israel has not been able to finish with Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by ruthless rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could reach the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Given that the Islamists have been gaining influence all over the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power that had previously been to Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf States has also made it.
Exultant members of Hamas say that Islamic Crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the North, which dominates the partido-milicia Hezbollah through Syria, where an increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies are threatening the King.
Especially in the flank South of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, didn't have too much time to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas and its leaders rely on more than popular opinion.
In further diplomatic action, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as the protagonist to which cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
In what concerns the military issue, have put Hamas in their place.
The anti-missile system iron Dome, Israel has proved its effectiveness, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis sleep calmer... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas of having launched the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamín Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have claimed the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to barrier that corrode the West Bank, the main piece of a candidate to become a Palestinian State, territory and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, according to international lawthey are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of a still harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Do you pamper those Palestinian twisted giving them a State of their own?
If they will really govern in the West Bank, would not they shoot rockets as their compatriots in Gaza have done?
It is better to have them behind the wall and give them a good blow if they raise the head.
Perhaps imposed tough wing, although the Arab spring could alter their calculations.
Although the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation to Israel, his priority will be tackling internal problems.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than the of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the superpower of the zone hardly help new Arab Governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve the high fire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
Also, the Israelis should think long-term.
With the rest of Arab becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination involves creating a powder keg which one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish State and demography worsens the situation to increase the Arab population.
Bloody missions on Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic toll growing.
Both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict.
The solution is still touting sensible people of both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two States and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
Hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire will give a little more impetus to people outside who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which should begin to put brake to the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue also should be pressuring Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would do more to the creation of a Palestinian State that the impending attempt to obtain a category of virtual state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role with regards to bring Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, it omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Back at the White House, it seems just as reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic packaging of tobacco law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking, and parts of the body with diseases look on off Green cigarette packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australian law regarding tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, enters into force and replacing logos and colors of the brands by a wrap one green off olive, appalling images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and sick babies because they are children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between packets, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of brands, all of them are printed in a small type of source.
It is the strictest regime of the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal Government of Australia says that the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking through the Elimination of the features that make this habit glamour.
It relies on studies showing that if a person has not started to smoke before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance to never do it.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, to understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Minister of health federal, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls relate the logo of a Crown with the idea of being a Princess.
While Australia has one smoking rates lowest in the world and that these changes will not affect too much the benefits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies argued that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that the counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will bring to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say that your business has benefited after the adoption of the Act.
Sandra is, Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover unpleasant images of the packs had been shot almost from scratch two months ago, when Britain completo Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco, Philip Morris lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.
The Ms. has said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that it was awaiting more stock.
"For us it is good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector is directed to that plan.
After a series of Australian laws that ban on television advertising and the sponsorship of sports and obligating the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has passed to be done online.
Australia has banned advertising on Internet companies and local web pages, but not to restrict it in foreign pages.
"If you comercializas tobacco and only this small window you have to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, researcher in public health from the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews from brands of "citizens foot" published on social networks like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook web pages.
One may wonder if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or any marketing company is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry focuses more in what the new regulations which implies marketing.
The industry has come even to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic recusen new standards; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that it is restricting trade unfairly, while none of these countries has a volume of significant trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO issued a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held talks with other countries that are considering to implement similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country which introduced the obligation to include images on cigarette packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering applying tougher laws.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"The photographs do not affect me.
Simply I don't them case".
"You take cigar and save the package," says Victor El Hage, buy a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Frankly, there is only one reason why would smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, Manager of the tobacco King of the Pack in the Centre of Sydney, indicates that uniform cigarette packs do find it more difficult to place them on the shelves.
"Normally it took one hour to desenvalar a delivery; now tardo cuatro", says Yu.
"The Government should have been completely banned tobacco and then, okay, it's over and we close the shop", says while lifting the hands up.
In a world constantly connected, it is not so bad a little bored
During the Festival of the day of Thanksgiving this year, unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane that we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for that other aircraft arrived.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention the duty-free shops.
But increasingly there are more academics and experts in child development that praise the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is good that both us and our children, we occasionally boring.
Bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and can you further creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or to that screen, we not experience the benefits that brings boredom.
So, we should accept the boredom of good cheer?
Yes.
And not.
But, now we'll talk about this later.
First of all, like many people, it meant that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history from the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("boredom, a lively history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in latin about the boredom that date back to the 1st century A.d.
We must also ask ourselves how we define the boredom.
"The problem is that already has been defined and discussed in many different ways", indicates John D. Eastwood, Professor of psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raise the idea with a discussion group formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of 'wish, but not to, participate in an activity that you fill'.
He says that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so.
He says there is the desire to do something with apathy.
The main experience of boredom, says, "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a feeling of that time passes slowly".
Boredom may sound awfully similar to the depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while people who are depressed see the problem they have it.
Sometimes we believe that we are bored, when that actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of someone who read a magazine article.
Some groups in the neighbouring room heard a television show blaring not keeping any relationship, others heard it with the low volume, so that was barely detectable, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they weren't sure of why and attributed it to the boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a task difficult or interesting, the alteration of care may lead to boredom", stated Mark J. Fenske, Professor of neuroscience from the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a production line, a music that distract you can help you not bored".
"In fact, today we know that move or scribbling, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, since they make sure that person is physically more alert".
"Investigations show that those children that are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a tendency to boredom "scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like "many of the things that I do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I have no time to do it all".
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and most varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that is bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he was put in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said that I was bored while I was in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said it was bored when he wasn't in school.
On the other hand, the 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would lower or higher.
But said that what he knew was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest level", largely because who is not given to children and adolescents great control on what they want to do.
So, back to my first question: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, can do we expose to absurd physical risks, such as betting or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way that have the brain tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is more appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to the guitar or Cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see the TV, it is possible that you will meet in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So, if your child is bored and give him an iPad, it is possible that already not be bored, but will have not learned to entertain themselves by itself or be dispensed," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to be dispensed is applied to other situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to be entertained, they learn how to better control in other areas.
I don't think that we really want to praise the boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our aim should be, rather the feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood is agreed.
"In our view, we need more bored, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something that is worthwhile," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados", says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise ceases".
Colorado: no book of instructions for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old in a Community Institute student and soccer player in Southeast Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the State: the possession of a few stones of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends drove by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that carry each a fine of $100) in which you were informed of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals," said Orozco.
And they are what?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote which took place in Colorado for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, response in hundreds of minor drug possession causes depends less on the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are canceling both here and in Washington State, where a similar measure was approved.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, that would be adopted legally after the law entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative districts of Colorado prosecutors have pledged to move forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western mountains, are voting to prevent to open marijuana shops, approved recently, in their communities.
"All of this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be the following," said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for regulations in the State of Washington also are mulling over the matter.
And they are still looking for advice to establish a system of licensing of production, manufacture, distribution and sale; all this until you arrive, date of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most States in terms of the regulation of the use of marijuana, first medical purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Committee on control of alcohol in the State of Washington.
But Mr Smith admits that anywhere or system can only make suggestions on what might work.
"There is a true precedent that we serve as a model," he says.
Washington, called I-502, law comes into force on December 6, leaving also a year during which swim between two waters, since licensing in that State will not even exist, but possession will be legal.
There are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, as a way of maintaining a balance between the requirement of the State to provide "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business in a radius of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, children's play areas and children's centres.
"Anywhere it will be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the Chief of police in Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which informed them that the city attorney would not bring prosecutions for minor misconduct for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would file charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The Chief of police Oates said that they would be responsible to enforce the rules of the city which regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and which would still be chasing drug traffickers and sellers.
In the Weld County in Northern Colorado, the Prosecutor of the district, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, said that his Office would pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly pressuring consumers and that they decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our Office has the obligation of bringing legal action against those faults which at the time they occurred were crime," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the County, already not CITES adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the County District Attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I do not consider that it is losing time to continue enforcing the law until this change," he said.
While 55 percent of voters supported the measure, ever believed that bringing marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the Government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the State highlight a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great environmental experiment in this State.
"It is a cultural barrier with the prosecutors of the district," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents the accused for possession of marijuana and local spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of marijuana law is.
"They have spent so much time bringing people to the courts which, in reality, still cannot be legal," he said.
To be the first States that considered small amounts of marijuana in the same way as for alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at the national level regarding the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and State officials have a new frontier of legal sales, also they eagerly receive instructions from the federal Government, which still requires the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana are hoping to the Department of Justice grant.
While some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes has been, the federal Government allowed mostly that there are business of sale of marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
"Although it is likely that the anti-drug agents not thrown out doors down to seize a bag of small drug, probably will be shown reluctant to allow the operation of stores regulated by the State for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, an exasesor of drugs policy of the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect to act the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, while it will be about a year before any of them can be opened.
Last week, the Western City of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it the coming week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, Member of the Council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking for what the community voted front to vote in favour of the State that voted."
There are many questions in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I harassed up to throw me out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Is it does not attack students for their views just now
I don't remember any time in my life that has not been dreaming to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek Symposium of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks of occupy my place at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to pursue a career in history, he had already the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were taken aback.
The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate some University classmates to keep sex in the room of the side.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had gone because they forced me to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because she had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my quirky name, nor the fact that it came from a private school.
Harassed me for only one reason, resulting in the birthplace of the so-called enlightenment rather intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I supported the conservative party.
You may ask what is that now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students of center right is suffering a similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights of homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graders cluster) of the Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously sections, personally attacked and treated as not welcome" for his political ideas.
They want to create a post on the Committee of equal opportunities for their college to be sure to express their opinions freely.
Their situation has not been helped by a recent documentary called BBC2 "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (paradise: young, bright, and right-wing) on students policy and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It featured the graduate student Joe Cooke, former President of the Association of the Conservative Party at the University of Oxford (LANÇA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say that you are treated as "scapegoats" by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20 years and Vice President of the Association of the party conservative of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday newspaper that "there is an increasing tendency of leftists at universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even know us".
Samuel Roberts, 21 years and history student at Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and President-elect of the LANÇA, claims that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the well-being of the members," he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was lonelier than one.
I entered College in September 1986, it was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred toward the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the University had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former student, a degree "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for higher education.
The environment had to shudder with fear to any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new University, when new students are known and know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I discovered the professors not only did turn a blind eye to mockery making University Conservatives that participated in it willingly.
Miners strike policy, privatization and Government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to rooms of wood of the seminar.
The first I attended of 18th-century French texts were translated into English and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please, translate the first paragraph".
I tell no one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"It is the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or, simply, they are fools?", he asked.
Other University laughed.
The eyes of tears was trying to contain burning me.
"I suggest you go to French classes in his spare time, provided it is not too busy meeting people," growled Pitt.
I returned to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the University; then I felt a light slap on the back.
He was a student of English from sophomore named James who is presented as a member of the LANÇA.
"I know who you are," I said kindly.
"I am afraid that this is how the thing goes.
Get with anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
It is very difficult for me, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers appear to be labour".
Later, in a local pub, I tried to cowardly hide.
I emphasized that it did not agree with everything you said Mrs Thatcher.
That trick was useless.
A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics which, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "you're daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted this ditty.
I became the dirty perverted.
"Can how to have sex the Tories?", asked one.
"Give a beating one to the other, right?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the 1960s liberal law.
Could some day lead normal lives in Oxford?
I would be forced to meet with people who think like me just after dusk?
Would he do I labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me was presented as a purgatory of isolation and ostracism.
One Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history aimed at my college.
They hated him for being not only of the conservative party, but also Advisor to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote him his speeches.
It was just there.
History marxista-determinista detested the place that considered provincial and insignificant and by its adherence to the vision.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy", I said.
I started to travel daily Oxford to my parents house in London, finding refuge in metropolitan open-minded friends and my family.
I told my father she hated Oxford and why.
I did not believe.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all the political views are accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved spires.
Even communist friends always had an impeccable attitude".
Your sore eyes began to cloud.
"It gives you another chance.
I am sure that have done so only to joke.
You break my heart if you let it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the conservative party, had succumbed to the pressure and resigned as their creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had suggested, speaking completely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Shame on the inside, red admitted that my parents had "brainwashed me" and called them "old stupid".
The Truce lasted little time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At the time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors desisted.
When I did the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Perhaps I call weak llorona.
But any person 18 years of age should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility at an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 Prime Ministers in the conservative party but that, to date, behind a nothing deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefer elegance to the notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of the seam", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: master of stitching", an apotheosis retrospective that gathers more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by its "maison" during the past 50 years.
"I love this Palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that do not could have been written without their distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, abound in private letters and pictures with the signing of the cream of the aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social climb: of humble designer of the city of Voghera, in the North of Italy, the international "jet-set" Idol.
Estar enamorado royalty does nothing wrong.
"Unless they do not go the skinny on your magnificent carpet butts as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the years 60 and 70, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertain with generosity and elegance.
"All he loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos beauties.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
Even so, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charism of the designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, which included Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything looked and felt your spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved ones", recalls the "supermodel", who began working with him during the week of high Couture in Paris, in 1995.
"Never it goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art", it tops.
Parade of rank
The life of Garavani isn't a story of obsessions, but well matched love.
He loves people with good education and best titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty metres long which proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and should be paraded down the catwalk to contemplate a "hearing" of dream that looks Valentino masterpieces, like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassisthe costumes used by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In the public of mannequins shine names as the of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía de Habsburgo.
Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember him perfectly.
It was pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket in the collection fall-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that I made it," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of designer.
"I prefer it to it above others by her femininity, for his great love to women, because it enhances our beauty", added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you used, have great light and are "donor" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco prescribers can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed to have the age and the chance to use one of their evening gowns...
Finally it's time at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to use at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with Ruffles skirt, "corsage" strapless neckline and draping.
"Was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigo D'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless" says this Italian Aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg saves her the designer dresses with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, is also the set of memories that entails".
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller dress at her wedding with Pablo of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the designer called his seamstresses) to elaborate that suit of silk ivory inlaid with mother of Pearl, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four meters and a half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the specialised press, that dress represents a milestone of the couture end of the 20th century, "the return of the high society clients".
Obnubilado for years with elite "savoir-être", Valentino is now its best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of highest rank in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the husbands of their clients.
"Always has struck me their refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance", recognizes D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was flawless, time does not pass for him."
If a Princess says...
The trade harder in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano play is life and health charging 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people that their work is a hell and another that, literally, works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by removing sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to drop every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur dioxide gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidified to come into contact with the air.
After launching large rocks of sulphur, which altogether weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that load on his shoulders through steep stone trails.
They are just 250 metres to the Summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes in ascend to snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring his steps with tiento for not slipping and falling off the cliff.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as did a French tourist who is plunged years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracted
Once above, make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scale that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 metres.
PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates since 1960 the volcano and, never better, this is their workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and is used to make matches, Fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As it is normal to load 70 kg, we get some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each journey", explains Anto, who usually carried out three daily freight.
Takes three hours each and just grind, but let you gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, it is three times what they would earn in the field.
"The wages of miners is very high here, where the harvesting of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the Tagus, it was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is so convincing as the sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where are Hindu, and I brought it to Java so that it becomes to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and the eyes become irritated by toxic gases
27-Year-old Anto leads three playing the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has begun to pass bill in spite of covering the face with a mask and special glasses.
You have asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that dismisses the volcano.
It is the price that it must pay to get his dream.
"I will work two years more because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," it promises one more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be tour guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead does the job of a mule.
Sharing a filthy cabana of wood with other porters, it rises every day at two in the morning because sulfur does well at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and glows in the dark.
Defying the shadows, ground low Anto crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he purchased with their money.
Around 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of the sulphur to save costs or supplied any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and so much weight.
In fact, don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) surcharge for camera, near the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park guardians charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
"This work is for the animals and not people," protest Madrusin, a burly carrier's 42 years in the Kawah Ijen three decades since I left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kg, ensures that it will withstand working "all he could" because you need the money to educate his three children, aged 10 to 18.
Not jubilaré me, I'll die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and rankles eyes when the wind changed suddenly and traps miners in thick columns that come out of the volcano, are so hard that none complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, obviously, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and sore shoulders, that have malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik already only can load 50 kilos to his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks moved to store water Castle, 18 miles away along a path of goats in the undergrowth.
"No me jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life," proclaims Unainik well opening the mouth, where you are missing several teeth.
Of their five children, the largest, in 30 years, also works loading sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuated from generation to generation one of the trades harder to the world: that make the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education by not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my wife patriotic, we comply with our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an ad for pills of mint, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at the Singapore birth rate.
The advertising company who made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement will draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people comply with "your national duty".
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that had to be addressed.
We knew that the Government had tried many things, as launch perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of speed-dating (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily ran.
So we thought, why don't we do more creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Which does not take it is so lightly is the Government of Singapore.
He spends US$ 1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of the Government for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends licenses for maternity and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city state rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - referred to as rate of replacement - it was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans don't have more children?
As Wei Ming, Director of marriage and family of the National Division of population policies, said that due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life and priorities objectives, beyond marrying and raising a family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of singleness, and to delay marriage and births, which gives as a result a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy EU tip to drastically increase immigration to cope with the decrease in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites abounding xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, critics by maintaining low wages and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also viewed as one of the reasons by which the party of Government of Singapore last year experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem with quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate have effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unintended consequences.
The Government is trying to so many small houses are not built.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there are concerns that can promote a life of bachelorhood and discouraged developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company the Developers, says that its "shoeboxes" are much faster than larger units sold.
They are more popular, in the sense of the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, admits that the new standards give clearer guidelines for developers, who soon put them obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
These new rules can be a step towards the increase in the national birth rate, it seems talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of downtown will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young Executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time", says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the Government try to push their citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the scope of private life are entitled to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child of 16 years?
How apply this definition in their daily lives and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which it is exposed by airing in Internet situations that surely would not share offline?
CNN interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, associated the term to "something very mio", at the personal level, and "in the key and user name", when applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets not rise them to a post," says Jorge, in ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which has accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can get to know them, but not of the world", says.
On FB I upload games or beautiful images.
I also entertain with my acquaintances.
"Would not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is making the ridiculous", says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, people naked, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says meet the 35 friends with in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I answer, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I speak with distant relatives or my friends in a quick way," indicates.
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Neither case would someone who recommended him to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, of 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts opened in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admits to not knowing to 20 people added in your friends list.
"Not scared me, because we have something in common, music for example", it indicates.
According to the boy, hinted to him nor has asked the address of your home or your phone number.
"If I pressured or require me you simply the sack of my account," acknowledges.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Are not the boy outside the experiences of what is today known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of one my friend were extorting in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded her money.
"He never knew who he was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, not closed the account.
"It was just privacy".
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would raise photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes it would do so, if it me cae mal or took you desire.
"Although I know that this is cyberbullying", says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and a degree in education and learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents is to be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"Internet arose as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game," he said.
Porras noted that the academic Marc Prensky, masters in pedagogy by Yale University and author of natives and digital immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who were born with the technology.
"We are digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we're still learning," he says.
Says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking that they have a criterion defined what should be not to distribute, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for that".
"Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences", adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do it does not serve", he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you do not contarías you a stranger, why do you on the Internet?
Or, would like to publish a photo of you as that you have made a friend?
Do you know what others publish about yourself?
When you tag photos of parties, would you asked for permission to others to tag them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as do them offline.
They are the same rules.
"One offline acts with respect, morality and other principles, should just be on social networks", says.
Surveillance
Stuart guard, University Professor, Professor of primary and education consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of paragraphs they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish", says.
According to guard, it is key to remember the lesson the children of "don't talk to strangers".
The Unasur Summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima
The 6th presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru while the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders was made public.
EfE tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry and Presidency sources said initially that they were going to deliver after the closure, but later claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
To be consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The journalists access to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only, transmitted in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential House with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by spokesmen for press some Unasur Governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document reported during the day was Presidents attendees list, that caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media calling for greater data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final Declaration" of the Summit, but it is the decision of Humala, and not the official document that closed the Summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III America Summit of SAAC Arabs (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being repeatedly required by the press, nor spread the so-called Declaration of Lima had previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA is can corroborate that the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international events, the Peruvian authorities strove on that would have ensured for all journalists transmission systems but limited the maximum information.
The Summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the Hague which shall settled a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in the Hague to hear the allegations of both parties in the process Lima filed against Santiago.
"We abide and execute the sentence that defines the differences today we're bringing to this International Court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the treaties and international tribunals", added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of both Presidents that will undergo the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogota, which had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua deemed seriously flawed.
The Summit was held with the absences of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo did not quote.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the Summit, shortly after noon on Lima.
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and set lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted mentioned the UNASUR countries to give "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what are expanding residency agreements".
It was reported that actions are promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against the insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make more accessible medicines, access to the internet at low price on all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but it should serve to expand our parent productive and envision a better future for our peoples," said Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects which will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two are running a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will for his reinstatement to the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need to maintain Latin America as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the topics underlined by the Summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional event which was expected to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute following a ruling of the ICJ, disputed by Bogota in an environmentally friendly manner.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these roads, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to tell you that we handle this in a civilized and respectful way," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega on Saturday would be found in Mexico where intend to attend the taking of control of the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the Summit, the Ministers of Defense of the block previously met to approve the Plan of action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case Yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who took part in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in the second world war" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in this sense, the project of establishing the South American citizenship that encourage countries members of Unasur.
"There must ensure the free movement of citizens and workers by any South American country, as already happens with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President was, moreover, in favour of the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and take into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights.
Give Chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we the South American it signed everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights is in Washington under United States funding," said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
CORREA said he isn't repentant of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but that he respected their "profound human rights and democratic values".
He added that, at the time, "had well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and does not respect the process".
It also criticized justice Swedish by asking that undergo on its territory the interrogation by an alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation allows it via videoconference, which could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
CORREA said that there is a risk that deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange.
"Have not spoken with him since it is in our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that I had a small problem lung, nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian President.
What is the danger of that deteriorating physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without exercising outdoors.
"That complicates the health of anyone," he added.
CORREA said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the award of a salvaconducto that allows you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that Word does not use it in this case, but there has been permanent talks.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he said that "If Britain tomorrow the safe-conduct this ends".
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, ask Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow same just this problem.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert itself as a defender of press freedom and pointed out that it does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lying, which undermine the freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists according to the non-profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard welcomed longer than these journalists "neither bankers nor bourgeois and hegemonic countries which dominate Ecuador", and said that of reelection "deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next election, arguing that the Agency "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and coated legality coups" because in reality "it shattered the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President considered, in addition, "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, that it benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
By the time failure to observe that ruling.
It is a problem between a country South American and Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward.
It also relied on a good conclusion of litigation by maritime boundaries that hold in the same Court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international financial institutions unless the two countries undertake to accept failure however hard that is".
In reference to the event that is presented as candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes pretty hard".
CORREA said that if he loses the elections of February 2013 will it withdraw from public life.
Personal power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as the Ecuador that socio-economic poverty only can be from political power.
"My political movement believed it was me who ensured that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Win would be my last time in the Presidency and hence we leave public life.
If you lose equally.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and tells me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, which is expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Doesn't mean a relapse in the health status of the Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are because of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed him the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb fell me," refers to recall the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to do "more softly", without apparent success.
The boy hid his family.
He decided to only deal with their illness and began to learn about it; with such commitment that already celebrated his birthday 43.
It is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, up to the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, yet many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 Years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the unit of HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after concern that this information was endorsed in April this year in a scientific journal prestigious.
Infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence fatal, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with best expectation for non-drug users: of up to 30 years with a count of CD4 200 and 50 years, when they reported 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means who receive positive HIV diagnosis to the 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as he remains in control can live without problems up to 75 years", explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS), also is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national data base have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; However ensures that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
-Do you still having deaths?
-I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I visualize it, so it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years have no shortages of medicine the problem is that patients become very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, or in late stages of the disease.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when already presented some opportunistic infection that has to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer screening massively, all persons who require it".
In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to get tested at a laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done and, despite his young age, was already at stage of AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications he even suffered.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die and do not want to know anything.
"If you will die, better me bust three times a week", say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, taking drugs.
To date, their parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life as anyone else.
"Work, have many activities, travel, am sexually active, but steward, I take care of me and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Millennium JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, afraid.
Make test, if they had a risk, which soon know whether they are HIV-positive, more is better and if you have the diagnosis, who learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are great gaps between the health programs and ordinary people, said Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the largest is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before gave us one or two, now give us a package one hundred, and that is fine but it is that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom", said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"To want them?" it is common question, scorn and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health staff, who don't want to expose teens, said the journalist.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in dispensers in restrooms in sites that young people frequent.
Does not encourage promiscuity.
Nor is pay the beers and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González, responded when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his administration.
"So it is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already practise sexual activity", said.
Keys in Jalisco
There is a 13,435 (12,158 AIDS) and 1,317 HIV accumulated cases.
The State is 4° place national in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 13 °.
92% of infections corresponds to the sexual way, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there by a recorded case of 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a United States appeals court a statement that unknown restructuring of debt of the Grupo Vitro accomplished via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario placed a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country having solvency problems.
I would say, therefore, that the procedures in guarantee of survival of firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country's bars and stars, against the grain of international conventions.
In the practical field, the boost to the ruling issued June 15 passed by judge Harlin Hale the bankruptcy court for the District of North Texas, leaves helpless Mexican firms against the possibility of seizure of their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main manufacturer of glass in Mexico to come to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
Input, while the judge indicates that creditor must be governed by the law of bankruptcy in the United States, the Court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings the insolvency processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply disregard procedural international cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises with transnational profile.
In fact, towards that end was the model law of the uniformity of the international commercial law United Nations, standing as referee the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the decision establishes that without intercompany vote, recognized the critical mass of the insolvency debts which had with its parent subsidiaries of Vitro, had failed the majority required to approve restructuring.
However, the ability to recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, the In Vitro was not the first case in which the schema is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompany endorsed Federal Institute of bankruptcy.
The fact also that you subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro they fought it in the courts of the United States, i.e. funds "vulture" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios convergence, Elliot international and Liverpool Limited, most have failed.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The Court of appeal ignored the data.
From another angle, this blame Vitro of the difficult situation that faced sideways of the severe economic crisis that pitted the United States, hitting the tail to the country from 2008.
Indeed, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family lodged an application for reconsideration of own Court of appeals to get the vote to the full of this, i.e. five judges, given that only voted three.
Not prosper this Cerciorare resource be reclaimed which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the Court sidestepped a document submitted by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the law of bankruptcy, noting that this is bursted with adherence to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with Chapter 15 of the law of bankruptcies in the United States.
Moreover, pointed out that the country bowed to the principles of the United Nations for the International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola in two bands: stick you to Vitro and stuck to the country.
Balance sheet
Dormant for several months the allegations placed on the table by Mexicana airlines unions against the ex-owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, pilot aviators Union Association already found the neck of bottle.
Headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau instance has just presented a criminal complaint against the National Banking Commission and securities who is accused of obstruction of Justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to give reports to the Attorney-General's Office about an operation carried out by entrepreneur to remove trust F/589 of the Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life."
Globe-trotting basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the Court and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental history collection of local basketball as wide as it has Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke restricted it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as a player of minor categories, player of the national Superior basketball, Attorney and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the basketball Federation.
"I got many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was President of the BSN, general manager of the national team and Federation President during the 1990s", recalled Reyes during a first time visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Kings does not exaggerate to make that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias denoting his extensive career, so prove it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, that treasures with greater emotion are that recall their passage by the Cowboys since the mid of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or assignee of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Championships of the Cowboys since 1967, whether as agent, coapoderado, or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including five championships run from 1971 until 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
Thereafter "Cuco" Ortiz, which was a great administrator took over", said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong, 6" Player 7 "in height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that has had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to the Raymond Gausse sniper, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a Championship to Bayamón, Gausse help bring another.
The Championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it is, but already in the distance, as for 1988 already contained of Federative honcho.
That time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we beat him for the first time United States during the Olympic qualifying in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup of 1990, where it reached fourth place and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee that made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group of World Cup 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as which beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a stripping the team of United States, which was quite similar to that which won us bronze in the world.
That not only team repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but they also had to (Javier), "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the lion brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the pre-Olympic of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players of role as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner instead of the players suspended for the mess of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did.
And not to mention his career in the different leagues that played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito towers.
Of young people, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that, at the beginning of the 90s, BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What you was done?
There were things that had wanted to implement, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
For example, only Ponce boys play in your area and only will face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now the children ride and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the result of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, official and referee.
That pleased me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, see videos of the music of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandkids and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Dies actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became internationally famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", which embodied a man's business without scruples, malicious and Manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory mogul oil man J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980's, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., manufacturer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the iconic role than he liked," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said the publicist for her, Jeffrey Lane.
It was joy to everyone who knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and will miss him a lot.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted that he had drunk much for years.
In 1995 they found a malignant tumor in the liver, and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman was made famous in television as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on the NBC network from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when it is an attractive Genie played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
It was also protagonist of two comedies that were soon to air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well received by critics in "The Group" papers, "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully obnoxious J.R. which Hagman led to its maximum stardom.
The dramatic series of the CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was to air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", intended to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risky bookmakers.
He also helped to give the series a record audience at that time.
When it was revealed the answer in a chapter in November of 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned into it and became the second entertainment program most watched in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers to "Dallas".
She was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to delete prostitute unless it is outside of the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheat businessman and a cheating husband who tried to his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), were interned.
"I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R"., said Hagman in 1988.
It should say: "Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only negotiated lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as someone "enormous, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans worldwide, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were passed a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
I had finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported.
Immediately there was a Warner nor of TNT pronouncement about how it will handle the series loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in New York theatrical scenarios at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian City of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001 titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) such about My Life".
"I put anything there that I believe that it would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told associated press at that time.
He became promoter of organ donation after liver transplantation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to attend the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them value, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then, '' he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, as "don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine".
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start course that explores the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore themes of apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people have held as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
But Charme had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict that it involves Israel, the place where the end times Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't mind this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there have been", said Charme this week to students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a period really well.
And remember that evil is good for those apocalyptic-minded.
And he is not only Professor that offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last history.
At Temple, Barry Vacker Assistant Professor is teaching the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore themes of apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time," said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," said beautiful.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, the Professor of Historia de Latinoamérica Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed to teach a course entitled "The end of the world" only.
"We do not add '2012' for always having the option to teach the course again, should not end of the world", said Restall.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no students another option rather than work "until the night that assumes that the world ends", said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Was it saturated in two hours," said Restall on its course to students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We receive messages by email for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in Religion and sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, N.j., at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that mentality apocalyptic, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
You Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and nursing, 25 years, claimed to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard about a class that you could teach that", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — and much less a professor — told to believe in the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project was on the Mayan prophecy and somehow we debunk it," said Julie Zeglen, last year student at Temple, 21 years and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; It is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes to its around predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"Elsewhere people do not think about this", he said.
In mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion of La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question if I knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years been many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people start to think immediately of the date" or to philosophize on December 21 is the start of a seven-year period within which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said that they intend to go to parties "at the end of the world".
"Maybe call some friends to make us laugh together," said Samira Ford, student of communications for 20 years.
