After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock market réctifia its losses. 
The transactions with the actions čez reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges. 
On Tuesday, at the beginning of exchanges, the Prague stock exchange renoua with his fall from the previous day, when she lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the decline is due to the fall of the actions on Wall Street. 
The market reaction against the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the US financial sector, is also visible at home. 
Fall actions in Asia 
Asian exchanges lived on Tuesday a dramatic decline, even if the indices succeeded, during the day, to remove some of the losses. 
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during the exchange, but later he effaça some of the losses and reduced the decline of nearly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China Enterprises following the movement of Chinese actions of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 percent, the markets are closed to Shanghai.

"The hesitation about action to rescue the US will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the monetary Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates have in Hong Kong the same level as in the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal of supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, the risk that other countries are affected by the impact. 
The bloodbath of American actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft of the financial system, in which she would have to spend up to $700 billion (almost 12 bilions of kč). 
Renièrent legislators and the appeal in support of the project of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the economy as a whole. 
American actions lived, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices actions experienced the largest collapse of the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones lost almost seven percent, having experienced a drop of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost already during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress céda: the government of the United States can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the Congress and the government of President George W Bush agreed on a broader agreement form of financial assistance to the American financial system. 
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week. 
American legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance amounting to $700 billion (SEK approximately 12 billion), given the American financial system. 
The success is not so sure. 
Indeed, prior to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the congressmans must conclude a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan supporting the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday at the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee on banking and financial regulation of the house. 
According to the sources, Wednesday the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid markets can be effective, will follow a "disillusionment". 
PAULSON: the plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
We have solved our views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilise the market, "assigned to the agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
In view, the final vote could be conducted as early as Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of legislators met the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to give the substance of the government a final form. 
It should buy, from financial companies, the real property assets leading financial firms in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety. 
"We are on the verge of we agree on a plan that works, and must be, also, effective on the market. 
We still need to pursue this recovery plan of markets, but I think we are, "Paulson said. 
A signal for Asian exchanges 
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on the markets of actions which fall. 
According to Senator Harry Reid, évadiez no Democratic legislators are so that Congress goes to a final agreement on Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of the Congress may affect on Monday. 
However, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when both houses of Congress comes in the vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the last moment, by this or that problem. 
Legislators hope that it will be adopted during the days to come. 
Nevertheless, the law have still many changes. 
The total amount for the assistance of the system must be divided into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as the wished President George Bush, must be available as soon as possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the option to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two stages: first $100 billion and then, finally, $350 billion. 
Mr Bush salua progress in the negotiations 
Although the president can put its veto to this decision, the Congress, he has the opportunity to put it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to obtain finance to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to vote of the law, and the Senate on Monday, "the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
President George Bush is itself content of progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy". 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement of relief, development of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also provides to limit the golden parachutes for managers of companies participating in the programme and it establishes a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the fund. 
The latter should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement which will work and be effective in the market and for all Americans," Paulson said. 
The plan also provides assistance to the estate owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advance in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the instalments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: a psychological assistance 
According to the chief economist of Patria finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult. 
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what will be the mechanism and the price of the buyout of assets for problems. 
This point will be crucial to decide on the share losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week, the server ihned.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important that this. 
"It is much more important than the congressmans agree, as early as this week that they support this plan and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological importance of the agreement, with the approval of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, "emphasized Marek. 
A fight extremely: MP3 players against the mobile. 
Advise you, how to choose 
While virtually all mobile can read MP3 files, any MP3 player knows telephone. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Nonetheless, there are plenty of reasons to get a reader independent. 
The choice depends entirely on the way to use and the requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to purchase for home a gramophone expensive high-end to implement the new album of Maxim turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such musical products not leave on disc record, and, in terms of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
However, if there is in your shelves crowded records, with the art rock, jazz and blues, you hope at least likely such a gramophone. 
The same is true of music for travel, namely high-pressure music, to put it in a simplified - of music in the MP3. 
Too, there are categories on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be hard-pressed to support the headphones purchased for twenty crowns in the market. 
These two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
Of battery life is also decisive 
Some readers high-end music are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, the most mobile. 
No current apparatus also Universal is that the telephone. 
Alongside the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, he is able to read music and films, to register them, it has a camera variable in quality and can, for example, to be used for navigation. 
And if one takes into account the smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that no refrigerator knows burn meat and that no television will not take photographs, we see almost a miracle. 
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks. 
As the number of functions that you use the more the interval between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy goinfres. 
The mobile are few who are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower. 
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient. 
In the case of cheap mobile, that they count will play music for a few hours. 
Moreover, if you happen to call from time to time,, to be safe, a second recharge for the work - this is true even for systems more expensive. 
The problem will not arise not for MP3 players, which are able, following a reloading, a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including the less successful. 
Another problem occurs at the registration of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the aircraft has a universal connecteur USB, since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
There is, of course, make music directly on the map memory, but little card readers know go without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile. 
As regards the readers, you do need exception (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fill, through the connecteur USB, the apparatus of music from the computer. 
Most of the mobile and readers will create themselves a library media closed after the name of the performer, the title of the album, style, and then after the judgment of the user. 
Some equipment is showing an index with a structure of tree, the way to explore windows, others are capable of two (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operative system). 
Readers are easy to manipulate the mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of a device concrete, intéressez-vous especially in the life of the battery, the ability of memory, quality and the type of release of her and, of course, to ease the contract. 
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if the day you will listen for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you only need any mobile reading the MP3. 
Virtually all mobile networks are today able. 
You cannot even obliged to do too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music which will arrive until you will be precisely this format. 
It is one of the most widespread formats and hand him, the vast majority of devices also manages to read music WMA format. 
The PCA (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common. 
The high-end mobile also allow, for example, the purchase of music online. 
It is sufficient to visit since the mobile phone, the Web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) corresponding to buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a convincing reason to buy a mobile music. 
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, radio tubes quickly facts. 
Prices are not the lowest. 
However, it is generally believed that the way to buy music (either by GSM, Internet, even by the wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people are always wearing their mobiles on itself. 
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile in your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home. 
However, it is also important if you still on you headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated bodies that have virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price. 
The expensive is normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand kroner, you can have a Walkman already very appropriate. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of a exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best telephones and better equipped, filled also an entry for ordinary headphones, no more than 15 000. 
Readers, by contrast, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
Really anyone comes to ensure the order readers the most rudimentary - who do not necessarily correspond the cheaper (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a post cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by an invoice to transmit data immense. 
What choice apparatus 
Even the cheapest mobile (by ex. The Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for memory cards exchangeable (the kind M2, MicroSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kroner. 
But made attention. 
The basic models do not support in principle that cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the more expensive if out even with memory cards 8 GB. 
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap mp3 player, take a Cowon, a creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a emgeton or a iRiver. 
According to the capacity (Max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you are part of listeners more demanding, choose rather specialist mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices are equipped with independent control keyboard to MP3, and so the ease of the order closer to that of an MP3 player independent. 
Sony Ericsson, including the Walkman mobile series have the same user menu that MP3 players sold separately, is gone the furthest in this area. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the battery (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Despite this, there is still something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not fail for a long time. 
We have already mentioned, repeatedly on mobil.cz the fact that Czechs operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The čtú (the Czech office telecommunications) who said that the price of an SMS was higher among us that in the rest of the union, has confirmed. 
Therefore, following the latest step by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could happen - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers mobile operators Czech cheaper that 'the country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a competition which would truly enter the fight. 
It may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration far exceeds the 100%. 
Instead, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, Pavel dvořák, president of the Council of the Czech office telecommunications (čtú), who has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there was more space for another operator, with operators. 
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently more lucky (indeed, at present, it would find that hardly frequencies). 
However, there is still a possibility – a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which has led to a considerable reduction in prices, which were subsequently respond also the traditional operators. 
Yet, even before the entry of the game such as Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile voice on the market, similar to those that is now home to suggested in Britain. 
However, it is apparent that there was room for such operators and they could have a real success. 
We are not forced to go up too far to find examples. 
In February, we had informed the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator mobilking. 
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country. 
Also, behind the mobilking, there is the financial group pentabde, which has included the U: Fon means in tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators as the opportunity to concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
For their operation to be effective, they need much less clients as a classic operator. 
They are, indeed, free of the construction costs, exploitation and maintains the mobile network, relatively high. 
That is why in the world, the virtual operators appearing as operators at low cost - they propose calls and text messages cheap, which is often matched by a limited supply of services. 
For example Tesco mobile proposes, in Britain, SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland, focusing on an unusual target group can also be a good time for advertising. 
Indeed, this operator aims specifically men. 
"real men choose mobilking - an operator who they like and that they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of mobile entertainment company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home. 
Miroslav čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone in doubt, "the Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based on the majority of virtual operators. 
As it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, saying the mobile operators 
However, it seems almost sure whether there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be mobilking. 
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech negotiations are not very promotrices. 
The launch of mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area, "said in a telephone maintains for mobil.cz Jana studničková, spokesman for the group financial pentabde. 
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Republic were, in any case, not of this idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that a potential competitor can arise. 
The group GTS Novera, which would not take a new and to become a real competitor of telefonika in the field of business clients, no secret, long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We are very keen to be able to propose to our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already conducted the negotiations about this opportunity on several occasions with the entire Czech of mobile operators. 
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said the group spokesman Pavel kaidl. 
Maybe the future is therefore promising. 
According to information non-officielles, it seems that perhaps we can accommodate the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by a total silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific. 
For the moment, no subject with a serious and complex project in this area we have contacted, "said Vlastimil sršeň of the department's press telefonika O2, in his statement to mobil.cz. 
Other operators are also reported to the specificity of the Czech market. 
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina kemrová says in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not registered for the moment project viable and beneficial bilaterally, which could serve as a basis." 
And she said: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator T-Mobile appear in the network by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time, we should have also limited now a concrete agreement. " 
Vodafone heads rather its attention on the performance of applications for its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of infrastructure costs and shared. 
This is what we believe means the more input from the point of view of customers. 
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a mobile Internet fast. " 
The authorities: in phase with the operators 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and therefore to a reduction of their benefit. 
What is good to facilitate the introduction of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, operators know agree as larrons in fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U: Fon also shows. 
The apparent greater pressure on the čtú, in the creation of the U: FON, was that exerted by society T-Mobile. 
Witness information available to the public from the Web pages of the čtú. 
Today, however, the U: Fon is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina kemrová noticed about it: "The competition in the mobile market was, moreover, recently amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of a player would submit the additional, and especially its services, to high demands. " 
But given the attitude of mobile operators, following the indifference of Czech regulatory agencies is disconcerting. 
It is however not only of the attitude of the čtú, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It belongs exclusively the Office for the protection of the economic competition (úohs). 
However, it adopted, faced with this problem, its position typical. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question rental of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such agreement has been reached for the moment, because the supply of potential did a priori not presented enough interest for the traditional operators, "said in reply to our question kristián chalupa of external relations department of the úohs. 
A statement and do not surprise from representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also take care, that person will take advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing. 
As kristián chalupa adds: "abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decline in the price of mobile telephone services." 
However, pressure in the direction of a functioning market honest and a decline in prices is apparently not in the interests of the úohs. 
What is actually shocking is the Concord almost touching three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question, whether it is really a chance arises, naturally. 
Similarly, the price of petrol strictly identical to all stations of service is due to chance and the hard struggle of competition. 
"The office has not in this respect, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it has no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators of dominant position, none has a corresponding responsibility therefore increased his behaviour on the market. 
The tools necessary to open mobile virtual market operators are probably even in telecommunications regulator, "chaloupa said in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the čtú that telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in this market. 
However, some experts of law propose another view: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, we need, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
It necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its business. 
However, even without accept this argument, it should at least be worrying for the úohs that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, complaints of many stakeholders (including society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they faced, in negotiations with all the operators, similar constraints. 
To place the blame on the čtú tower is a fairly common in communications, through which the úohs must stay the hands of the matter. 
We have already met with this type of attitude in many similar cases. 
It has unfortunately failed to pass in the novélisation of the Telecommunications Act, adopted recently, an extension of the powers of the čtú on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of the úohs must very well know, but their interests are apparently other. 
When no Nobody watches, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo- operators, many in the Czech Republic, mobile networks remain unnoticed. 
It is companies issuing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of dealing occupant the multi-level marketing firms. 
Mobile telephone services are singled for Amway and proposed by example by Bohemia Telecom, starlife and many others. 
The price lists of these firms do generally to elected representatives. 
The turn of magic is in the fact that the company made before the operator of a classic company customer, which commands a large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important customer, she obtained price offers special (and others). 
The problem is that the trade conditions of all mobile operators Czechs prohibit such a resale. 
"If it is true that you mention, it could be a violation of contractual conditions that we look at and which could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our questions relating to this problem Martina kemrová. 
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity is not responsible for mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it may involve thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, decides against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these firms provide non-négligeables their profits, and at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators real, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav čepický indicates the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these businesses are used only as a percentage of clients negligible. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded on their name, they cannot be fully, in the manner of ordinary customers mobile operators. " 
However, it is precisely this which should seem strange at the čtú. 
In addition, there is another question on úohs. 
If the mobile operators are a blind eye on such a procedure, why blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be added that the úohs has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if he does not want to simply explanations of operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions banning. 
When we will not be the most expensive country 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a considerable decline in the price of services. 
However, almost in all countries where appeared virtual operators, the traditional operators is efforçaient, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by them were virtually the same - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely at this level that have occurred in the developed countries, the regulators, who had not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers. 
Both by formal steps by an informal pressure, they eventually obtain the creation of a virtual operator first, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the regulators Czechs treat this issue like a hot potato which is dumped in the passing a target near. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is in these cases more than beneficial. 
But we must not throw after so easily. 
If the information of scenes say true and a virtual operator will soon appear home, the Czech mobile market is perhaps in movement. 
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the úohs can only hardly remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) other interested parties. 
And we will perhaps call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Well the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, on the occasion of the day of nationality Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem KDE domov můj (where is my homeland?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of jiří bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a solo male or female, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version. 
The song is assured by kateřina kněžínková and Adam plachetka. 
Otakar jeremiáš and Jaroslav krček arrangements are the authors of the anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server ihned.cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he had already done before český Rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for the interpretation of the versions solo singers with young voices and representative, who are marked and appreciated. 
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good proverb, so that we understand the words, they sing simultaneously," he said. 
The Czech national anthem, will next year, his 175è anniversary. 
The song KDE domov můj for the first time in 1834 on the boards of stavovské divadlo (the theatre of the states) in fidlovačka (kermesse savetiers), original piece of Czech Josef kajetán tyl, accompanied by the music of františek škroup. 
It became popular, and people are the appropriate spontaneously. 
After the creation of the tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath naturally became an integral part of the national anthem. 
He was one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent. 
How sounds the "new" anthem 
The transport (MHD) pragois will, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of the pražský dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise transport) as the date on which amount in the metro, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
At this moment, it is accessible for approximately one hundred thousand people, owners of the smart card opencard. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will apply from 1 January 2009) and both the register on their smart card in the points of information and the offices of dopravní podnik (the transportation agency), located in subway stations, můstek, nádraží holešovice, anděl, roztyly, letňany, kobylisy, rajská zahrada, kačerov and Luka. 
As of yesterday, it also has the option to buy the Internet coupons on the Web pages of the dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people of the service during the morning. 
Those who begin to use the shop online can forget definitively the counters in subway stations, where they were so far trample anticipation in long lines in order to obtain paper tickets. 
Indeed, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and was will on their card opencard in one of the 13 městská knihovna (municipal library). 
"In these contact points, there are available to passengers a desk with a trained staff, which will help those concerned with the purchase by the Internet and, furthermore, will the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesperson of the project Martin opatrný. 
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to register the electronic coupon on the opencard in the vending machines installed in the lobby of several subway stations. 
It looks these distributors? 
They are red, of the machines to the tickets and passengers may have already noted in subway stations roztyly, budějovická, P. Pavlova, florenc and vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should be at 80," added opatrný. 
A automaton will control the coupon instead of driver 
The vending machines which will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is sufficient to introduce the smart card opencard and the coupon bought earlier will register himself on the map. 
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city. 
That is in the train and bus lines 300 to 499, used essentially the inhabitants of the municipalities of the central bohemia for access to the capital. 
"In the trains integrated into pražská integrovaná doprava integrated Prague (transport), the inspectors are equipped with card readers, through which they establish the validity and temporary zonal coupons," explained the control of the tickets Filip drápal of the organization ropid, who defines the pragois transit schedules. 
Buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the body of the driver. 
During the boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but we must also put the opencard at the place on the side of the body. 
It is thus that the driver controls the validity of registered voucher. 
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of the coupons registered, there is nothing easier than to ask for this information," compléta completed the driver. 
Passengers who do not take the bus and does not recall the date expires the validity of their coupon, can join new vending machines, originally used to record them on the map. 
It is, on the screen of the aircraft that will display the information on the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten wanted a referendum in the USA 
The Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 that šumava be integrated in the United States. 
This is a letter filed in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna (the science library of the South Bohemia). 
If we cannot make part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans were allegedly addressed to the president of the United States with such a desire. 
This is partly a letter preserved in a private Archive, which is today tabled in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
Krumlov český Germans, in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská" (župa region of forests in the southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - made in Czechoslovakia. 
"We understand the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come on the German territory not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "people, which the fate of the šumava heart." 
Given that the supporting Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - by knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude poorly, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urged US president to take in its hands the protectorate of the šumava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe that you accorderiez this territory in a state that is alien to us which oppresses and destroyed minorities and who has not contributed to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter. 
The reason for which the authors may not sign the letter is the fear of a desire for revenge "oppressors Czechs." 
If the president of the United States questioned the opinion of the German šumava, would have to organise, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether the people wanted to be part of the United States, or living well under the management of the United States. 
Although the text in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war seem somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time. 
While the Germans Czechs should at least consider that the question of their expulsion of the Republic will, very few of them are reported such a possibility. 
Some that the United States and Britain would get to the Sudeten certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed that they remain simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav chalupa, born at české budějovice confirms this. 
During the war, he was, as a German české budějovice, committed in the Navy in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu 'at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed in the camp of capture of the region Holstein, dozens of Germans Czechs came to him for that they learn the Czech. 
"They believed that once return home, Czech would be beneficial," said chalupa. 
None of the captured German who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was not, according to him, that, following the beneš decrees, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You do not thoughtful – you pay periods! 
A campaign attacks emotional drivers 
The action road safety in the most expensive Czech history. 
One way to characterise the emotional media campaign that intends the launch on Wednesday, the Department of Transport. 
The office of minister aleš řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving behaviour. 
This campaign costing $150 million will appear on television, radio, film, on the Internet, but also in leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers of rapid and drink-driving driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before start. 
It is primarily affect the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
Especially the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Also witness the slogan "bloody" of the entire campaign: 
You do not thoughtful – you pay periods! 
The phrase "you do not consider" is included in majuscules on the registration plate. 
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase "Thou paieras." 
What should symbolize that you can pay life a moment of inattention. 
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010. 
The ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly images with drastic images of victims of accidents. 
He believes that this will lead to a decline in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czechs. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of the sugar and the whip against drivers 
"What works with the drivers, this is the system of sugar and the whip. 
For them, the sugar is represented by, for example, to save time, when they grillent a red light. 
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks should be recalled to drivers, "said Martin kořán, the psychologist transportation of the hospital has homolce. 
That we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist. 
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static panel which warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers see do more," reported kořán. 
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, president of the interim government, Israel said in favour of the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the occupied territories (), if not all," said Olmert daily basis. 
"We will keep a percentage of the territory, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not happen," he added. 
He admitted that the restitution possible would include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want tractors and bulldozers squash the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to abandon parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple Mount, the sacred places and historical" located inside the old city. 
"Anyone who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, "he stressed afterwards. 
Retirement of the Golan Heights 
Olmert also ruled in favour of retirement to Israel the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, it would also require some effort by Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a pension from the Golan Heights," signala-t-il. 
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to relinquish to obtain the Golan. 
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relationship with the Shiite movement Hezbollah (); they will have to renounce the constant support they attach Hamas terrorism (Shiite movement), al-kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "the prime minister. 
Issues that arise after the accident: the stewards in because the illegal? 
The law ignores unknown; walk in a long distance is prohibited because 
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of society student agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can during the journey move inside the bus. 
"If you wanted to respect the law strictly formal and activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel hanzelka. 
The accident, in which a hôtesse has died aged 22 years, has apparently been caused by the driver of a lorry has crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was at this moment unfortunately beside the driver, the most dangerous on the seat of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
However, the coach may have an accident, or so sudden, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What is important is if the coach is under its technical sheet with places standing or not. 
If this equipment for places standing is not approved, passengers must remain seated. 
Buses long distance student agency do not have standing places; this was confirmed to aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim jančura. 
"It is a question that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, "he revealed his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is taking this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription does not prohibit the carrier to offer services. 
The law on road transport is only the term receiver of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds with more ambiguity the spokesman hanzelka. 
Josef pokorný, the director of the Department of the movement of road vehicles, believes that, on the contrary, the law treats sufficiently the problematic. 
"Everything depends on the fact that the coach has in its approval permission to propose places standing. 
All lies here, "he says. 
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are places standing and a maximum speed limited, with places standing and a higher speed limit in buses and long distance without place standing with the maximum speed the higher seats and fitted with seat belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav hořín, an expert in besip (safety of road traffic) in security in transport, does not see the movement of stewards aboard as a major problem. 
"at a regular movement, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in the aircraft. 
Here, too, it is not when will be a turbulence and the air can beat your head. " 
"However, in the case where the bus would have resulted in a sharp, the laws of physics obviously would be valid. 
In the same way as an urban bus or a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal regulations, "he says, and believes that the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove these services 
Student agency is the only carrier coach services to propose the stewards. 
It recruitment two hundred. 
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession as a Profession at risk. 
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it is a job at risk, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can receive their coffee and their Journal boarding. 
This would also reduce the costs, "he says. 
The concern for safety is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in its vehicles, the director of the Asiana Alexei litvine, which provides, in comparison with her, a very small number of lines. 
"We have no hostesses. We are opposed since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident, "he said, there is a týden.cz. years 
An immense tragedy arrived 
A young hôtesse in the region of plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A lorry has probably Slovenian quité the gang of emergency stop without using clignotant and it has blocked the path to the coach. 
The driver of the last to try to avoid using a sudden manoeuvre, but it was approached by his right side. 
Jančura denied that the two reserved seats at rest stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to treat these places, they are blocked." 
The company complaint against the driver of the lorry. 
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not continue to wait the judgment of the court, but in relation to the financial compensation, it is also on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in view 
A change in the law, which is being drawn up for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts of the Department of Transport, could provide clarification to the travel of stewards to board the bus. 
"It has not led to any conclusion on this point. 
In fact, it is not too interested buses, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones at the wheel, "said the expert hořín. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity stewards as something that would fundamentally undermine the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman hanzelka, specifying that the control of security buses is under the control of the police and the agency for safety in the work. 
The hopes of düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words do not lacking in the letter by the steering committee of the WestLB employees of the house. 
In a union of entities Financial Institute of Düsseldorf with the Frankfurt deka-bank, "the central institution of financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group" could be, according to the Mail made public Monday. 
The WestLB would provide a "bloc of competence" doubled a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick-off to other mergers in the sector of banks Länder. 
That is what it is like when a committee board wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, injured, is still suffering a strong pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also the federal authority of monitoring of financial services, it has only recently made clear to the government of the province of rhenanie nord-westfalie that the time was counted in the search for a solution in the future. 
It is however issue for some time now - the side of Frankfurt – a relationship of a form between the bank Deka, which is the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Certainly the leader of the deta-bank Franz Waas said at the presentation of the numbers of months in late August that he did not see any sense in the merger of the home of the Mainzer landstrasse with a bank of land, either the Helaba or the WestLB. 
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which each half and is supported by the banks of the Länder and by groups of boxes of savings, instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with the WestLB for commercial activities. 
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of thereof. 
The talks come however only start, it said in the financial centre. 
This is not the first time that the deta-bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the most important employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidation savings and loan sector. 
In 2003 it was thought for a moment that the deta-bank could merge with the bank of the land Rhineland palatinate and the halbab. 
Nothing is yet emerged from this display package. 
Barely plans they had been made public that the government of the state of Hesse is spoken against any participation of the hellaba in them. 
Subsequently, the other two houses are not rejoignèrent either. 
The Bank of the land Rhineland palatinate was attached to the place to the Bank of land of bade-wuttenberg Stuttgart. 
But there was always new dealings on the reunification of the deka-bank with banks of Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Committee of the hellaba, was however pronounced against any trade strategy of merger with its bank. 
Regardless of this, the feeling is spread that the reunification of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election to parliament of the land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg might in the first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure that obliges new mergers should increase the potential partners escape him gradually. 
In the South, it is now a junior partner, although it was far better withstood the crisis that banks in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping savings and transfers of hesse-thuringe, which owns 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, however, has drawn a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
The NordLB at remain rigour. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques is however that a multifaceted. 
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the decisive question, namely through what business model the future ability of Länder banks should be guaranteed, had not been previously determined by the German group savings funds and transfers. 
Ultimately, a carving up the WestLB could take place, that here is obviously not wanted. 
It is also what is discussed in the letter of the executive committee in place: in any case, would be covered a 'overall solution "to the establishment. 
How this will all be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the deta-bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the Beer Festival is also known as the weekend of Italians. 
For Elena, this is the first time to Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanied it as the girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, "he says. 
Behind them, almost a of five litres of beer of the Mark Kaiser, stands a bearded well built showing around 200 visitors of beer festival what sounds deep his Gosier can produce. 
Elena Tiananmen first Luca, then the kisses. 
In Bologna, they came up in Verona. 
From there, the Road station near the station puorta Nueva, four buses take this evening at 11.45 pm, "destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra 'arrival in 6h30. 
Three buses are reserved primarily for the Italians, in a bus travel of brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the car park, the South singing of T already alongside their flag, they have already celebrated last night. 
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians. 
The bus belong to Marco, wearing a long coat doubled false fur and glasses to large montures silver. 
For five years, they go to the celebration of beer, already three virées this year alone. 
They range from night, remain the day celebration, and return to pm. 
Spend the night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the pot of welcome with a beer Kaiser, in accordance with the law of purity Bavarian health insurance and a responsible for the group speaking German - Marco made a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already the bus ride in the night on the autostrada direction 'brennero'. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus passengers sleep. 
It is better, as they will still need their forces. 
The breaks will be made to Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other bus with Italian registration plates are once again a break shortly before Munich on motorway 8. 
When the morning, the group of Marco is finally coming to six hours thirty as scheduled on the car park near the place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses throughout Europe are already here. 
Elena, Luca and other grouped, Marco takes a last speech, explains the plan of attack. 
Firstly: to crown small yellow hat. 
It is written left 'beer festival', in Gothic, and to the Internet address of the travel agency of Marco 'conoscersiviaggiando.it ". 
Secondly: 'when the doors of the beer tent, on court' shouts, Marco in the early morning. 
'Run!' run and reserve places at the bottom of the tent. 
Not before, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, we must distribute them in the chamber! ' 
The Chope shouts, Marco, costs 8.25 euros. 
And not forget the instruction! 
"show security agents that we behave well! 
As you leave your seats, they are parties! ' 
Thirdly: "This evening, be income here has ten and a half hours pile! 'understood? 
And it is there, it is party to the beer festival. 
On the road, someone builds yellow hats to trees to find the path to signs and even a election poster of a major party popular Bavarian. 
It would be ready for the return. 
It is the second weekend of the festival beer, known as the 'weekend Italians'. 
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50 000 who set off through the Alps and collapse in the newsstand to beer, 10% of visitors would come express Italy this weekend. 
The police munichoise is reinforced by seven police officers of the South Tirol, by Italian volunteers who support the Red Cross that produces a Bavarian statistics on countries where the Italians in the first place to the British (60 speeches) and the Austrians (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
That is particularly appreciated the Italian is the attempts of the brewery hofbräu. 
Disruption nights for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the federal finance minister only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word 'relatively' and he slid that the German banking sector would not be spared by movements of crisis. 
It is indeed that this weekend. 
The estate's financial Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX, side gets a consortium of German banks credit of a billion to protect itself from turbulence in the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations are issued until an amount of EUR 35 billion. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay the interest on the fraction of what it would be right. 
The money comes as private banks that banks of public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa which supports the losses. 
The state financial was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible for the fact of distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the Reserve Bank reserves had been reduced by 95 percent to 237 million euros, the rate of capital was also slightly weakened 1.6 to 1,45 percent. 
The current net profits and those from financial transactions were compared to the same period the previous year, dropped to zero, profits from the allocation of claims and securities determined and termination of reserves in the operation of credit had dropped more than 70% to EUR 5 million. 
And it is only through the important benefits from the reimbursement of costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group, as well as the DEPFA interest payments according to the green procedures tax and commercial purchases for businesses to Konzern that the deficit of the gains of about 16 percent proved to be moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financial had first poorly speculated on appropriations industrial estate, which then had been filialisés to the Aareal Bank. 
As the classic state funding was not profitable enough, the DEPFA was then hired more intensely in the infrastructure projects and in the funding of projects in common between private investors and state (privat-public-partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the société-fille, the Hypo Real Estate should proceed to amortissements that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an effect essential equipment which is quite unclear. 
The fact is that the dividends have been cut. 
For 2007, they had already been truncated by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate, since the takeover of the DEPFA, an investor of state and infrastructure highly important. 
It is more solid than other institutes dependent on inter-bancaire refinancing on the market since it has no submission of customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks was again considerably up, the banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for part - EUR 50 billion euros - of all credits from the average Depfa a short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need to finance the group is covered with credit in the medium term, and the company protected the influence of international financial markets largely outside condition now. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009. 
The president of the executive committee HRE Georg Funke explained however that the group Hypo Real Estate should not have to resort to financial markets in the medium term. 
The federal bank and the federal institution for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) from the principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is now guaranteed. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank did more than hope. 
However, of the momentum and the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
This is not unthinkable that we should not use the funding in its breadth. 
But the opposite will not be eliminated. 
After the fact that the bank, according to the latest reports, even at the gates of insolvency late Sunday, the rescue for the least provisional will not fail to reassure the minds either. 
The action price collapsed 75 percent to €euros. 
Recent obligations, by contrast, are particularly well. 
While the primary debts have barely moved over the loans, the second plan flagging. 
The most affected are especially investment funds of the old société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those of course have a shelf life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate appeared to be an investment in alternative speculation, now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the tightening of the net banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the Depfa Bank. 
As the emission institutes, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or well happen that nobody dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months. 
But with the noise of renouvellés partial nationalization, the likelihood that up the sureté has now become a mere hope based. 
This should reserve sleepless nights before any long-term creditors on the decision of whether they are separated from their commitments. 
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to be a postponement losses for the next few years on the next tax on income of capital stock gains automatically collected. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the box to Bento 
When Sylvana hiltrop, 16 years must be present for the first day at the highschool of Tachibana, girls are beginning to Pouffer laugh: the German is so "Kawaii"! 
What does it mean? 
Sylvana is already this word with mangas - in his new log exchanges, she speaks of Japan. 
"During the first day of Japan. 
Est-ce-que that I was excited. 
Already the way to go to school, I was afraid. 
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the highschool of Tachibana. 
I find the road alone, fortunately I have not lost. 
The beginning of courses do not appear to be set so strict as home in Lower Saxony. 
Pupils are the one after the other from eight hours, until at least twenty nine hours, a round table begins with Professor, the "home room". 
But before the course begins, it was for me to present. 
I am not at all kind love to talk to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils. 
As I had not yet of school uniform, I have an old skirt my mother of home, and a blue shirt, socks and shoes black leather. 
In this place so I appeared before the chair, and I tried to rule any correctly: 'Sayonara wo she Sylvana...' - I called Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At this time, I was very pleased to have begun to learn the language of two years ago. 
The 31 girls class have all made masses low, pouffé laugh and signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii". 
I already knew the thanks through my mangas. 
It is up to the vocabulary for the survival of Japanese ados and means "beautiful, cabbage." 
Secondly, I am quickly crept in my place. 
The daughter beside me made me a great smile ironic, she found that it was an honour that the corresponding to sit alongside it. 
The rest of the time was fairly calm, but when the gong was roiled, I was attacked in the rules. 
Everyone was talking to a better, more pouffait laugh and asked me many questions - in this case, it is rather difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, then they all got their Bento. 
My host mother I had also made such lunchbox – this is really something other than the miserable snacks Germans. 
I had Rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Good, except perhaps the salt plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only of lunches in Japanese schools. 
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a bento she has prepared itself, which is then prepared very carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could observe here too. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo. 
I have always replied: 
"Because it fascinates me," 
Ultimately, read the mangas, that is what I prefer for years already. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture which is, at a time, I have also begun to learn the Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I also have a low for the traditions, the customs and habits. 
And here, they are given a great deal of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technologies and recent trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And everything is so well organised, I never felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. " 
The rats also have the sensations 
A rat or a cafard fled to the danger, it mean that it is also the fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations. 
But how can we ensure that it has the same thing when it behaves in the same way that we? 
In the online magazine "edge, contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
Spiegel Online present in a series of articles answers to the question 'What do you think be true without power in the proof? " 
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of conscience without me or anyone else has until now been able to prove just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains are the same configuration. 
As soon as we move on to other species, and that we address the issues of felt or in general consciousness, we enter the difficult terrain because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is before a danger, it is the same thing as many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
Humans behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a subjective experiences comparable. 
However, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective experience that animals difficult. 
One aspect is that the associated circuits almost always human conscience include the prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the Office of Management and implementation). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans that among other primates and seems to be completely absent among other people. 
All the less so for these aspects-ci our conscience which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that humans differentiates even other primates. 
Another significant feature could lie in the language of human nature: a large part of its existence is related to language, this often means that his conscience depends on it. 
In this case, we could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on language, it certainly would influence, so that the animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, is différencierait probably a lot of most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is also difficult to determine what may seem an awareness among other animals. 
If this, internal and subjective, does not measure or because of the hardware particular, based on our own experience, then his observation we poses serious problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the content of the experienced aware, but there is also another aspect of the conscience which should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
We could examine the process of conscience animals without taking account of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the nerve correlations of conscience on the causal mechanisms causals: both can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal cortex in achieving the display. 
But that result for the emotions? 
I conclude that an emotional system such as the fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reactions of the body) of the alive. 
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterise the primates, and especially the man. 
Subtle degrees of felt, associated with our nature abound, emerged because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorise states for the charge to other than we even. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio for example think the sensations from primitive activities originate in regions of the body of cortex, and the core, like Jaak pankseep however that focuses more on the brainstem. 
As this network is not much changed during the human development, it could actually part of horizontal sensations of any kind. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict the, but I believe this indémontrable. 
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear among men and rats is probably also identified as such in the two cases: how could yet check if rats and men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way? 
A cafard fled before the danger, but if he felt fear? 
In my view, similar practices are not sufficient to prove the experienced identical. 
Admittedly, the comparison nervous assistance: rats and men have similar brain logs, the cafards however does not have a brain. 
But does the waistline strokes is at the origin of the sensations? 
And even if it could prove to the man: how could the show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I do not know how the show. 
And because their sensations are differentiated likely completely ours (since the human conscience based on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour as the sensations emotional rats. 
In all cases, progress on the plan poignent nervous insofar as gauge the same thing in rats and humans. 
As I do not explores the language and awareness among rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
You may judge it as in the short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than beaten me constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed a pragmatic émotionel. 
Platini, the president of Uefa: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The deputy prime minister Iwan wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister. 
"The government considered the decision UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championship," announced wasjunik.

The work has just begun, and there is still much to do in the two countries. " 
In the calendar of building or the destruction of stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines. 
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six. 
"We can cannot time to lose. 
We must work at the maximum speed, "said the chairman of the Ukrainian league grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA has constantly in the eye." 
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland. 
The direction of the Polish Football League PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The commission was met on the request of the Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
"There is a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki said of the Polish news agency PAP. 
"We have provided in a letter to the president of Uefa that preparations for the 2012 European Championship did not suffer." 
Several members of the Premier League were already in the previous season, sentenced for manipulation of compulsory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the league has even be the point at the last minute.

It dregs dregs and counter-attack. 
A war of late rose to the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engaged in a battle loudly - with the known throughout the world. 
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis have long been unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
She would be aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce. 
The reason for this strip thoughts lies in the press relations of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - is recounted the story of a adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on her unfaithful husband qualification fell clearly: This would be "monstrous", said the "New York Daily News", 54, that "Meg remâche again the history of our relationship and the manipulates." 
It would be more "regrettable", that "the death and the upheavals that have a divorce for each child to again be revived in public" for their son common 16 years Jack. "

The price of airline tickets and hotels fall 
In the first half of 2008, the number of flights and nights hotels were cheaper than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a current study, the flights will even be reduced to 50 percent. 
The flights and the hotel nights would benefit once - it is the result of a study of the financial services and American Express travel. 
The company has analysed the data bookings in the first half of 2008 and has established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter. 
After that prices on the market hotels have increased over the years, the hotel nights have already reduced in many places. 
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined yet 6.9% on average compared with 2007 in 41 of 48 European cities examined. 
From April to June, prices were already however 3.6 percent lower than the previous year. 
The trend was clear in Paris and Rome, where the passengers were paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier. 
The causes of this résideraient for American Express in the weak dollar which led to a "desire to travel down American tourists. 
Financial markets like Frankfurt and London would be even more affected by the decline in prices of hotels that industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish town, prices for hotels lie with an increase of 26,3 percent, the highest in Europe. 
Also in the price of flights, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter. 
The fact of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class have pay on average 7.1% more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very consumers of fuel, have even increased until 29.2 percent. 
From April to June, ticket prices in economy class have fallen by an average of 12.5% in comparison with the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price variations were far less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have experienced a fall even more important than in other European countries: 
From January to March, prices had risen by 119 percent in the second quarter, they have fallen by 236%. 
Domestic flights Germans have even been divided by two, according to the study. 
The reasons for this fall in prices would be a side depressed economic growth, explains the firm. 
The request cèderait ground in many market segment travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is a heightened pressure of competition by the treaty "open skies" liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign the tense situation is the removal by the airlines non-rentables routes, and the high number of airlines that have filed the record during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe. 
HSV bats Gladbach 1: 0 
With a purpose and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first ranking. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a Eleven functional. 
Of Kristoffer Klein enlarge. Landing disaster for international player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbach player is returned that late in the game and its sights lifted fail against the framework of the goal. 
His message was precisely formulated, it was out of his lips so persuasive. 
It simply knew that he was right. 
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the room in the arena of Hamburg. 
There was little in the changing room, the half-time was over, and most were stale in their place. 
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he has a great reputation as many former players. 
And that is why his request has been received at strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and lifted the inch to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the chief entraineur of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
The orders appear to have been similar: and that it is with this second goal! 
The implementation has missed. 
"Everything was not very nice to see today," avoua later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would "liked to be more relaxed". 
The 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg must to a hit in the head by successful Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very low Gladbach players could not do any harm to the low players of Hamburg. 
"It was a dirty victory," Marine summed Marin Jol. 
The SV Hamburg will on Monday its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the tables of provisional ranking on the giant screen that showed their club as a first class. 
It will be an anniversary without a genuine celebration. 
"We know to take a step back," said Marcell Jansen. 
It is likely that the interim results of table reflects more the unpredictability of the Premier League that dominance of its HSV. 
The team with its late arrivals committed - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Guardian purpose Petric like Jansen débauché form of FC Bayern - certainly slowly, but it is not yet. 
"We need more charm and more of dribbles' required Jol.

Of the dark influence the flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in confusion: the dark matter influence the speed of probes for what is called the gravitational support manoeuvres. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" steals in space. 
The fact of fuel conductions soon cryogène jellies, death threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause confusion among researchers - the anomaly support support. 
The support of gravity is a manoeuvre space probes, by which they receive an additional momentum in the field of a heavenly body, the earth for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe research américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as The Ulysses solar probe. 
This is what surprised researchers elsewhere for years: the flying objects are not always 100 percent of the way we expected according to the laws of gravity. 
Much, irregularities occur at the level of speed. 
The probes are becoming unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptisèrent the anomaly of the support. 
Some experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, who described the force of the area because of the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron Einstein does not wrong and trying to explain the anomaly of support with what is called the black matter that the have identified in the universe. 
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he writes. 
Researchers from space are the existence of the black only for about ten years. 
It is apparently it a force of attraction whose effect is observed on other célestes body. 
It is, however, completely invisible, i.e that it sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter is still a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe. 
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed. 
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros. 
During the shooting before the release, six hostage takers have been killed. 
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been abducted.

Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the ballots of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released. 
We are in the process of verifying their state of health, "Frattini said. 
The five Germans, five Italians and Romania as their eight Egyptian guides are doing well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants of the outing in the desert should already be the road to Cairo. 
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of hostages remain fuzzy: for example, the kidnappers were close to put an end to the kidnapping, according to the testimony of a security officer Egyptian, before the Sudanese army was killed six of the kidnappers station without shouting. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were agreed with a ransom, "said the agent. 
That nothing left to collect the hostages', when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred. 
Sudanese soldiers were shot Sunday six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage takers for Germany had demanded a ransom for an amount of EUR 6 million; money had to be submitted by the German woman of one of the hostages.

The men should be retained until the kidnappers have found a safe route to escape.

Abuse of a father-in-law "which led to the suicide" 
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by his father-in-law led a woman to suicide. 
Michael trerise, 57ans, Stithians, in Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitted eight charges for of lines of facts. 
The high court of Truro has referred it regularly linked his belle-fille, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death". 
The court has been told that Ms Randle, aged 34 years, has suicidée home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, trerise had committed and bandaged before the force of sexual acts, while his mother worked at the local pub. 
Trerise and his wife have divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall. 
Its belle-fille partit in Plymouth. 
But the tribunal was told that Ms Randle, industrious volunteer of National Trust, was the abuses that had been imposed twice a week. 
The attorney general, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends told that Ms Randle, who was a good surfeuse and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead" and "had lost all hope for life." 
In April 2007, its true father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
We think that it is suicidée in themselves with a plastic bag. 
Mr. Randle confronted the father of her daughter, who was also written a letter of tradition which as follows: "I attachais and the bandais regularly". 
"I did not abused her sexually. 
"I feel responsible for his death." 
The Judge Christopher Elwen told trerise: "You are really bizarre as attached, your victim should certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7 years. 
"This unpleasant saga has ended with the suicide of the victim. 
And what even more surprising is the fact that if she had not committed this gesture, its history is certainly never finished the court ". 
He added: "I emphasise in particular, as the describe his father and his mother, the effects of your crime made for years on Stéphanie. 
"Without them, it would undoubtedly doubt today a young woman happy, promising, and success." 
A sentencing for loss of official data. 
The Cabinet of the officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, has been the BBC. 
The man of the Ministry of Defence was travelling when he oublia two highly classified documents on a train in the direction of Waterloo. 
The documents are made in the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police. 
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent. 
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner said that this episode had many people of Whitehall. 
"They thought that this matter would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said. 
The employee who cannot be named, is accused of the 8.1 section of the act, i.e the clause which deals with the protection of information. 
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer is placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the sensitive nature of his work with the committee associated with the secret services 
The documents he lost contained assessments on al-Qaeda and on the resources of the security forces in Iraq. 
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret location. 
The building societies face the invoice B & B. 
The British companies of the building may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers of Bradford & bingleys. 
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money savers, including 59 of the building societies. 
The director general of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said he is "irritating" to know that companies and their members must pay the bill … 
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & bingleys will be released. 
But the interests that are at the same time increase will be subsequently charged each year, the 700 financial companies who collect deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is to see that the institutions that have had a prudent behavior … must now pay some bills institutions that were much less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It proclaims that each company must pay a sum proportional the deposits it holds, and that the intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will run in 2009 to £450millions. 
This means that the companies will find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director-general of the trade committee of the building societies, told the BBC that this decision it seemed unfair. 
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have had a prudent behaviour during the recovery of the housing market, must now pay for the institutions much less cautious. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first history. 
"We need to examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess the options to adopt to prevent the building societies and their members pay this bill," said Mr Cole. 
The interest for 2009 cover seven months, from late September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, it will have to pay the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Given that the building societies are organisations without shareholder, their member up paying the bill by higher costs, or by the lower interest rates for the savings accounts.

His lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina saying that it does not require bail because she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer rafique-ul Huq.

BSkyB loses the battle continued D ITV judicial 
BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the commission of competition, which would require it to reduce its participation in its provider ITV rival. 
The competition appeal tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV of 17.9% less than 75%. 
The commission has said that in the past, the participation of mskyb had prevented competition and enabled him to influence ITV unfairly.

NEW inquiry in the case of American prosecutors. 
Attorney General has appointed a special accuser to verify the question of the dismissal of nine American prosecutors in 2006. 
The whole is born of the account of the case of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who criticised the actions of some ministerial officers. 
The report was critical of the officers of the White House, legislators and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation is based on the argument of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is the political causes. 
The accuser special, Nora Dannehy enquêtera now to whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to investigators, closing and justice. 
"serious allegations of conduct potentially criminal, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved," said the inspector general, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special accuser capable of compel witnesses to table, was one of its greatest recommendations. 
The dispute starts by radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors formulated by the U.S Department of Justice. 
At the time, the department said that prosecutors were dismissed for cause poor performance. 
But then, it emerged that prosecutors dismissed were not more criticized that other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these redundancies Political connotations. 
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate on charges of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
The American prosecutors investigate and continue the judicial authorities for the government. 
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot L "be for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was accused of being involved in the case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned. 
A number of Cabinet officers from the Department of Justice have also given their resignation. 
The inspector general's report was very critical of the role of Mr Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered "senior" of these redundancies, and eventually "surrender" its leadership role, "managing remarkably not involved in this matter. 
Other cabinet officers, including former assistant of Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticised for not having managed to cooperate in the investigation.

A dark Street in the city, often forgotten, and can soon be on sale. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and roads, some famous parallel, others only functional. 
. And even some taxis veterans and long-standing local residents will give instructions to go to extra place, because they have never heard of. 
The street is in the East Village and through northern first street- not to be confused with second street- between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a poussiéreuse rather than an active artery. 
. Some panels not indicate the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard Atlas. 
This street has however of admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street. 
It wants repaver extra place, and create a more fluid passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including long-time neighbours, said to be charmés by this shortcuts simply because it is one of the last and oldest streets of pâté houses. 
But the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the city, which administers the street, has no interest in the bear. 
This month, at a meeting of the committees of owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal authorizing the manufacturer estate to buy the street. 
But the committee would prefer that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked to submit a new proposal next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of committee No. 3. 
"There is a short space of belonging to the city, and we hope that the city retains extra place" she said. 
"They could propose to restore and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repaver the small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee which the manufacturer concédera space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the floor of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner. 
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker that went abandoned, and make the public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the preservation of real estate, confirmed that the city was well sell the street, noting in addition, the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than the manage. 
Compared to its neighbour more colourful, Bowery, extra place has left a slight historic footprint. 
Some believe that extra place is the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm of many children of Philip minthorne was divided, leaving this small piece of land, which stayed since abandoned. 
The entry of the CBGB, a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has re open for extra place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo album of Ramones "rocket" to Russia 
"This place was magnificent" said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scrap metal, haillons, barriques, posters, leaves and strings. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already talked about the evolution of the luxury of the East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling extra place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Other proclaimed bonus place as a true rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be done in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called jeremiah' 's vanishing New York (sous-titré "the book of disputes: a nostalgic bitterly on a town in the process of extinction") in the history of the city and extra place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac dark day and night, and defined by the doors of a warehouse in iron rouillé and persiennes, full of newspapers last week which are along the gouttières." 
With few exceptions, the street was always the same pace. 
A rat short agilement at the bottom of the alleyway, near a door that was once the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a clothes shop chics. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer 22 onces empty, depends side of newspapers which have just been thrown. 
Some people said they think that rarely to extra place, and suggested its development. 
Mr. field, for its part, said he thought that some felt under the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "were held in places dark, wet and dégoûtants". 
The debate bilingual: immersion in the English language 
In this part of the programme supervision of the education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about bilingual education. 
Launches T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you may think. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school." 
Draw favours of Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr Obama emphasises that "American students African-American and have less chance of being diplômer that white students." It is true. 
To combat these differences, the educational programme of Mr Obama argued in particular among many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are learning English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education which defends the classroom training of languages other than English, goes beyond its interest to eliminate the differences. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street prep, an elementary school in the East Conté of Los Angeles. 
Students in this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low income. 
More than a third of students, comprising many newcomers, studied English. 
Among the students of cm1, 100% have passed the examination of state math 2008 expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of anglais-de langues-d' arts 
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that put forward by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street put on analyses of practice, a constant assessment of capacities and an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, "says Linda Mikels, chief of the Sixth Street, the school has introduced the instruction of the English language" full dumping ". 
Total immersion in English focus on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Ms Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, was proclaimed "we had a huge success with a student who had arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you go without his class, you would have had no chance to identify." 
"It works," says, "it worked for us" 
Mr Obama should not take example of Sixth Street, and the reply in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves, but the policies on education within his party (the associations for national education have long bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscure pronostique the response of Mr. Obama. 
Although it is favourable to immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently seen this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language. 
"On the contrary, he said," You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish. " 
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it should consider carefully, education models that work, rather than be dismissed or considered insignificant. 
Net drop of oil on the new concerns of the world economy 
Oil prices fell sharply Monday, because people are afraid that the rescue plan for the financial marches, will be able to revive the economy. 
The crude oil futures have fallen by 7% arriving at $99.80 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange at sales this morning. 
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday. 
Over the past two weeks, the markets for raw materials have been buffeted by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After having experienced in July, an increase to $145.29 a barrel, prices have dropped to almost $90 a barrel this month here, before rebounding again at the sight of profound uncertainty in financial markets. 
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this week end by the leaders of Congress. 
The news has been watered down by the recent concerns that the crisis would be durative. 
In the last episode of this financial disaster, "citygroup buys banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday. 
At the same time, the Belgian governments, Dutch and Luxembourg have party nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis. 
Barclays Capital analysts have said that the frenetic negotiations this week end, concluded with the agreement of rescue "do not seem to have managed to revive the market". 
While the economic situation is détériorasse, the demand for raw materials, oil included, should be slow. 
"The prospective global equity, interest rates and exchange markets, has become uncertain," wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank in a letter to their investors. " 
"We believe that the raw materials can escape this contagion. 
"As regards the raw materials, our most pressing concerns is that of understanding how American virus is diffuserait-il overall and in particular, China". 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the fall in consumption of oil due to the slowdown in economic growth, therefore were obliged to reduce 20pour cent, forecasts of oil and gas prices for 2009. 
The festival of the second crucial time for the improvement of the record of the team. 
Having spent during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything. 
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under clouds obscure. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles 12 yards for a touchdown, a precursor of afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward. 
Favre found Coles for other two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second 10 seconds of the half. 
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all its passes to Coles. 
"It is a mediocre player" 
"We communiquions extremely well, despite what the people think." 
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defence fought the quarter back of cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Revis, corner back, has intercepted a Angriff lost and made 32 yards until touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another passes and was intercepted. 
, linebacker David Bowens left escape the ball cause of Warner. 
The last change, the loss of the ball Bowens, could well be the most charming event 
The Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets have recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best that the Jets have mark at a time. 
"The coach of jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness," said the second or third time? " 
When he told the deux- the Jets have missed 21 points in the third temps- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third. 
"Many points have been marked in little time." 
Gebrselassie rested, beyond his world record. 
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie, has again proved to be worthy of his title of best runner of substance of the century, after having beaten his own world record in Berlin marathon Sunday, became the first to run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 a race accommodating on the flat, Gebrselassie beaten 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, played last year in Berlin. 
Has 35 years, Gebrselassie has won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, the 1600mètres of the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution is increasing its asthma. 
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In conditions almost parfaites- sunny, 48 degrees at the outset, 55 to the arrivée- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The runners of runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all Kenyans, converted into two runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory of Sunday, Gebrselassie said to reporters, having suffered the calf mollet two weeks before, and they missed the training for a week. 
It is clear that the rest has enabled him to remained brilliant, but not rouillé. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I have submitted last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, it all went for the better. " 
It was reproché- especially in Kenya, the African rival is the ethiopie- to have too orchestrate its races, avoiding the stars of the world's marathon, with in fact on the hares as if they were in a competition for runway, and considering more world records that the sense of the competition. 
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gebrselassie capabilities as a runner of substance. 
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to receive path. 
Two elite runners Kenyans, James Kwambai and Charles kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the leading heads have disappeared. 
A little more than three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie made his final rise to move away from Kwambai, who came second in 2: 05: 36, improving its best record staff of five minutes. 
Kamathis is come third in 2: 07: 48. 
Women in the race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, surprised everyone won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical badly on the back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving its third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
She ran making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyan take a great advantage, the then exceeding about 18miles ½ after. 
Askale Tafa margasa Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city in hand, the pride and black life events 
Hidden in the development of its huge Park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet town where born the pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, first City fully black to integrate, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that she did in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today." the town in the five lakes, three short croquet, 300 skins, dark, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and in prison ". 
It is now become a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora festival takes every year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer, the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in many ways, the city that she became décrit- tourism through its inclusion in the tour guide the Florida published by the depression- era federal writers' project- remains a place to share. 
It is also independent private worthy, and that it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said the rural population black Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, that "we know so little, does not know what he lost". 
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who was also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious gaze from abroad. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident ever and the oldest paroissienne of the city. 
"She must be in line with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It represents both a historic model a takeover of blacks as a community of almost 2 400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of rural black culture sudiste- a few times, other times acclamée- reminiscent of the birth of American slavery. 
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston. 
It presented its hometown in the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "mules and am" (1935) and "Their Eyes were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide Florida turned this city, located just the road 17, a road that runs through the central Florida, often forgotten, resulting in terms of black history and the human tragedy. 
Bold such a big cash in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store in the ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"over the road on the left," wrote, "you will find a modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these areas of game well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care, although he can barely read and write. 
It was also mention the new husband of widow dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and everything that can be used for people to pass. 
Therefore, in just one hundred words, Hurston Associa Eatonville to a car government but also to the analphabétisation, the remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not the well. 
It was not in a portrait that everyone appreciated. 
Zora has described the reality "it said Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Hurston has immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who louaient their beauty." 
She added: "Some people have not appreciated." 
We always remembered Hurston as a live person and eccentric, who had frequently after his family had moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, showed that Hurston was always in a city without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and was the trousers here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional clothes. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, when many made fun of it. 
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said. 
But he added in addition, swinging in his chair of the patio that gives on Lake sabelia, where Hurston was certainly christened, that "it was never too long". 
The death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and his books were out production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College in the 1920s, it was buried in a grave whatsoever, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived. 
Has Eatonville, no great celebration, or plaque for the general public. 
I do not believe that they have understood the contribution or the legacy that she offered in the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" wrapped In Rainbows, "a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Public officials Orange County wanted to pass on a motorway in five routes in the city, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, main street of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already prompted Interstate 4 until the angle west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville called just a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the isolation relatively idyllic community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mix races led hatred at the gates of the community. 
"At that time, a gang of young whites came launch of oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Ms Franklin. 
"A lady is dead even." 
They waged a pastèque of their car ". 
In a letter from 1955 addressed to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse my race". 
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakened the confidence of young people. 
"Black children had used to be embrassés- I am reminded we it embrassait our master in the morning, and also the night," said n.y. nathiri, daughter of Dinkins chief director and the protection of the community of Eatonville, a group not profit. 
It lasted, ajouta-t-elle, until the teachers and students do more came from the same place. 
"You do not embrasses tone professor white because it is blanc- I want to say that there is a line of demarcation cultural" said Ms nathiri. 
The civil rights also create space for many other Zora Neale hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went to the damage, as it, army of a cheerful confidence clean and guidelines, such as: "How can they lose the pleasure of my company!" 
It is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the grave of Hurston anonymous and began to fight to revive his reputation. 
Five years after a biography hailed on Hurston conducted by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, the réintroduisit and the American cannons. 
The proposed highway arrived just when the girl the most famous of Eatonville had regained her appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours in the view as a sauveuse. 
The community has begun to organise a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans came at the opening of the festival after two years, and many back in January, to commemorate her. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the motorway to five ways, very fast, a real civic pride," said Ms nathiri. 
Miss Boyd summed up the first declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the motorway project has enabled him to change his own image. 
People non-resident as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attended our church, depuis1993 began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library mono theme (renowned obviously Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles to Orlando, it can at any time is regarded as a back street during a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's. 
(It are now 90 percent of blacks) 
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être are still treated with caution. 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, of black men in the Champs- should not be photographed. 
Much to Eatonville, as Ms Jones, a courageous and which has a low for the Red lively, have always afraid that their island community is well understood. 
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, or better or worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, wild and mixed than other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is the civic sincere affection that is in the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or to the police, who need additional forces. 
And even for younger people, as Alondra Kenon and of 11ans Alexia, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned properly the Eatonville description. 
"Most people, who spend in this area, think:" Oh, this city has nothing compared to other "Alondra Kenon said after the church last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very beautiful city. " 
Here in New York, all speak fluent finance. 
Despite everything, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan took place from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they do not achieve that they are in the eye of the cyclone. 
Never they might think that in the offices in glass and nest of bee over their tète, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, are the worst "working day in office" since the 1929 cocaine. 
The men continue to slip on the streets, with their carts and shelves of muffins for the matinières meetings. 
The Latin American still always between residential buildings with, as the mules, 50 shirts luxurious pendues to a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office in still queuing to buy their matinier sandwich street dealers, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16H and 7 in week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I décidai to open a new savings account. 
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, because I découvrais at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people queuing. 
Not before the counters of cashiers, or to withdraw the species or make a payment, but before the door of customer service, where the usual customers commandaient their checkbooks, tourists asked the direction for the Macy shop, and the new offer customers of accounts. 
Most of those in front of me, I apprendrais later of Starr, my "banker" authorised staff were all the tail for the same reason that me. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money savings accounts of so-called thrifts (as a society of building), associations of credit, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that are working in a state, and who say they treat customers and their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have bankrupt. 
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 made use of the syndic bankruptcy and while the New Yorkers were at home for the week end on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts, with a value of $440 million, was sought a buyer for the save. 
The bureau and the employees of shops that are before me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money in a bank that their seems reliable, or one that is the rescue on Wall Street. 
Any New Yorkers have become very familiar in the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a woman in my local supermarket Chinese, the call of Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and its meagre director general Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that she could have to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, the concierge uniform my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or shipments of my merchant of fruit and vegetables. 
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary market fund. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take a risk". 
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria fluctuates to the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the party Austrian Freedom Party, Filip Dewinter and right of the Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation "cities against the Islamisation" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008. 
They wear road signs of mosques removed in red. 
The police accused the right-wing extremists have been desecrated by a Muslim cemetery Austria, the week end of victory of right-wing political parties in the general election in the country. 
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged the traun cemetery, near Linz, between the Friday night and this morning; it is according to the police, organised action. 
The offenders have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives, however, that this could be done to conceal the feeling of hatred of Muslim extremists towards immigrants. 
This accident could be somehow linked to the elections. 
A spokesperson for the Islamic community said to be "deeply shocked" at the news of the desecration, which occurs just religious during the month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end. 
Austria is seriously to regain his courage, following its Oscillation towards the right during the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two right-wing parties who have raflé almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti immigration. Some of their slogans were even seen, according to the critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party won more than 18 percent of the votes, has led his campaign against headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the food Alaha. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Polls and the analyses carried out immediately after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.

"I photograph master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer – photographer 
Neither heels or clothes to étrenne. 
The essence of the great masters flamenco, freed of all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
On the one hand, the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
Inseparable except in privacy, in these times unknown to the general public, where we found to intimate gestures and stolen gaze of artists who care not to go on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixture in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stage with singers, dancers and guitaristes with this side less known artists. 
In this project, the photographer repeats the particular iconography flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Flemish photograph of the month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," explains the creator, which clarifies that "Flamenco -" people "can be anything but, having seen the photos, the Observer realises that this is not the typical images of artists on stage. 
These people photographiées "in the street" artists are able to pass on stage passion, sadness, and joy... in engaging the public. 
To capture moments of personality of these artists must not make photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a distinctive character. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of moments of personality stars flamenco ". 
With the festival "popular song of mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, the guitaristes or the dancers with a camera to mark. 
They are the portraits, thanks to the choice of the camera and hardware, reminds the photograph classic. 
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the traditional side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "very traditional roots music with surprise and that every day." 
It is not the dance and song in itself, but of the personality and character of the artist who captive the public with his art. 
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant in this work that you present these days here in the gallery El fotómata. 
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from approximately 70 artists photographed. 
The project has turned into a anthologie of flamenco, which will be published in a book of collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for portraits of Bauer has led to repeat the idea two years ago with the "portraits of old sports" ("sportartproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves the portrait of the people, know them and enter their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the most difficult kind. 
You are in front of people, of characters that sometimes you do not know or that you are only a few minutes to make them a photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try my ideas into reality. " 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people," is exposed to the gallery El fotómata, located at number 20 of the street the Mata (Street parallel to the stand of Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.

The novelist hispano-américain acknowledged that "there is no way to measure" and whether the books change life. "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has the effects" and "makes people less similar", because it writers were asked not to go to the frivolity "and assume their vocation.

"Sangre Mayo ’, the gamble dared to garci 
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis garci récrée the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre Mayo ’, which is the most ambitious film of his filmographie with almost EUR 15 million budget. 
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula echevarría at the head of the long list of players.

A great admirer of the literature of galdós, José Luis garci ensures have done with this film "a dream of child" through Esperanza Aguirre, who has, three years ago, to turn a memorial film for the two hundred years of 2 May Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story stuck to national historical facts. 
The EUR 15 million provided by the Madrid are common for garci "a unique opportunity" to reproduce with the settings and clothing appropriate the atmosphere d 'A' Spain which has misled head for the fight, because the fight for independence led the people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII, "he said. 
But the filmmaker regret not having secured as funding for films "Captain Alatriste" or "the ghosts of Goya ’ - more than double that achieved for" Sangre de Mayo, because it has not been able to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost all his career.

Isabelle bayón puts himself in the skin of the dancer sévillane tórtola Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay tribute to a dancer also sévillane. 
Carmen tórtola Valencia, daughter of a father Catalan (florenç tórtola Ferrer) and a mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the District of Triana and that at the age of three, will live in London with his family. 
It was a dancer and dance specialist in free Eastern dances. 
It was an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset preventing the free movement of women. 
The life of the woman who has marked the history of dance in the interwar, Europe has fascinated Isabelle bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter nominated me to interpret the dancer sévillane tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible". 
According to the dancer, "We are not trying to tell his life but to translate this way of thinking. 
The titles of his dances made me think of the flamenco. 
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "snake dance" in some tangos. 
Its dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dance was identical to his "," she says. 
The dramatization was made through two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda that chantera new Isabela in one of its shows, as it had done with "the Puerta abierta"; and the professor Matilde coral, which was exceptionally well wanted to work with the one that was his student. 
"Matilde tórtola transforms into a mature character. 
I am happy because it has agreed to play a role in my work and I honour ". 
The dramatization was made also thanks to the musical composition and the guitars de Jesús Torres is paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, El pulga y me to Morón; the impacts of El pájaro, and the violation of Rafa El Viola and cooperation of a player, juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas". 
This work also recounts, somehow, the life of the woman who was on display in places so far removed, especially for the time, as in India, the United States or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since it was usually in London. 
"I wanted to back because I believe that it is women who have a huge influence in their time, and now no one knows only highlights his work," says bayón. 
The show will begin at 8.30 theatre lope of Vega 
The publication of the "Journal of a poet recently married" concludes the triennat 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "of a poet recently married" in the church, St stephen' 's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez has married with Zenobia in March 1916, falls within the framework of the activities envisaged by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008) held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for literature and their deaths. 
In this way, the "triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the creation of this work with the international conference which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the goodwill exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: this peuplier light" which was inaugurated in May last year and which, having travelled in the various provinces Andalusian, will go to New York at the International Congress. 
Similarly, the ministry of culture of the Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "of a poet recently married," published by Pedro tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo pérez-enciso, to continue the work of one of the best-known poets Andalusia. 
America fond less without Paul Newman 
"time God creates perfect people 
Paul Newman in part ". 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "lack of militia is", and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and the whole of America, with the idea of striking that Newman is not of this world. 
It had difficulty to obtain an Oscar 
It longer revolved since 2007. 
Everyone knew that he was ill. 
It was a blow to the entire world. 
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford, "my life and my country were best through its existence". 
No one was afraid to make ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a period particularly unclear, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the estimated Americans fell well below, in desperate grounds of dignity. 
When the time is so hard and without reason to live, there are human beings that admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda for like Paul Newman. 
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for combat drugs created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and creating its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has had difficulty to impose against a suicidal food culture. 
This wave of admiration for expansive Hollywood without attention or the nationalities or the passports. 
The latest James Bond, English Daniel Craig, noted that no James Bond died before him. 
Another English, the oscarisé Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dared appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We have set the bar high," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only today trying to break the screen as was Paul Newman: being very honnêt and having a serious privacy and the objectives. 
It is not always easy or possible in the jungle of our media days. 
But there are those who try and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, in which it was true even if the opportunities do not needed not to be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a beef steak in my ice?", he usually laugh. 
The sky, it is with pride to the meeting of his daughters with its fans on earth, something which is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the major roles that he interpreted, it has never been so proud that the husband, father dedicated grandfather lover, thoughtful and philanthropist," disent-il. 
Madrid in the race for the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid to organise the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved in 2016. 
But I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: We don ’ t! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race that I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would be subject to a éliminatoire note. 
But look in detail, and from the beginning. 
The errors begin with the withdrawal of dossards, which requires you to go ahead. 
This is not easy, but if they make you move it would be better if they give everything (including the electronic chip to shop). 
And although no 
They were you go there only to take the dossard (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise, there was that the size 's' for the Jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
What world in world we live? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis that they decided to buy the small shirts with less of fabric and the coup expensive? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the racing. 
Apart from the fact that he must go very early to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, furthermore, it should leave his backpack to entry. 
The expectation has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected in these races. 
Since there was a long queue, competitions have begun, and we did not yet have left our rucksack to entry, although once done, the withdrawal was worse. 
In addition, the rain has accompanied the expectations of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellions and the hut assaults. 
I believe that some 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, do not even figurerons in the classification with the exact time because of the chip that they gave me, which I believe has not properly marked the start. 
Of course, if they asked me to mention an example of the perfect race, I would certainly not to the idea. 
I believe that we can always dream to become the host city for the j.o. of 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a virtual (réceptionniste) 
At the conference on the emerging technologies mit Microsoft has presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but able to do some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move into the campus of the company) in response to what was asked during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "réceptionniste" can know how many people there are in place, that they are - including remember what positions they occupy, and listen and hear the key words of their conversations. 
But also the pool that groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, the réceptionniste detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is to speak with her and that she is not part of the company. 
She asked him if she is here to visit someone and she said that she will respond in a few moments. 
All of this without the blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we spoke in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and there is no longer associated as many programmes. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster. 
This represents a discovery since Microsoft version after version, has not ceased to added functions and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft has reason, its operational system loses importance but also its software. 
When Google Chrome came on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the hardware and the software to understand. 
It is the same function as your wife or your husband when you say something to your belle-mère. 
It is true. 
He will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a truth relative. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less attention to the operational system but increasingly to the Internet browser. 
We turn on the computer only to turn Firefox, explore or chromium and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than to go windows. 
Has used that half of applications provided with the system? 
Who can more the less. 
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Less cumbersome, months congested, less complex. 
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately in need, indeed, and I shows you an example. 
The picture presented in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees to Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own research tool - "your research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to seek information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay has occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009, but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010. 
Microsoft will surely launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, increasingly resembles a computer. 
But the launch of Android as backward and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly. 
The stunning Marcel 
Pablo Picasso the assumed on Côte d'Azur, Leonardo Di Caprio bore in the 'blood diamonds' of Edward Zwick and Al Pacino in "The Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the Association of muscle gay. 
And if we are to list all appearances, one could also mention the costaud moustachu who raised the weight in a travelling circus. 
This is not a simple jersey of male body in cotton, milling and without sleeves. 
The English call 'Tank' but the awesome Marcel of Brussels differs among all the others. 
Firstly, by its name flamboyant - although it is known as' Marcel '- which has to do with sport because it takes the name, according to the legend, the boxeur Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from other by his cotton excellent, by its unisexe Cup, with its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the shirts of the best-known bodies have in the neck. 
But attention because the Belgian Mark does not only that the tank tops. 
But it also produces the boxer, sweat-shirt retro, cardigans in Kashmir, cotton, babies, mini-shorts... 
The clothes designed for the comfort of his underwear. 
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as his underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me" 
Its enormous resemblance with his sister has not prevented to develop its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is a small but full vitality. 
Currently the sisters Cruz take seriously their new activity in the fashion. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls beautiful and famous who lend their name. 
She was present at the promotion that the Mark mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but as well as the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish House sponsors. 
Monica is warm and timid. 
Tell what you do in Paris. 
I came to present the new Penélope collection that my sister and I have created for Mango for the new season winter, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino. 
A day very intense but, at the same time, exciting, we expected. 
Based on what your new collection created for Mango for fourth this season? 
The film of the 1950s and 1960s we dazzles and we matters very much to our collections. 
I like very much me away in town and observe women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do. 
Actress, dancer and designer, you are a woman very versatile: is it not? 
I believe that yes, but in the end everything is joined and these activities have much in common. 
Since I am tiny clothing am plaisaient; I désirai go to my grandmother to look in the filing of my 80-year-old and to see its clothes. 
It was brilliant, almost better than to go to the amusement park. 
Then, when I became a dancer, I always trying to take care of my way I dress. 
Like many of the dancers dress for prices and tests to look in the mirror and feel well. 
And in the role of actress when you endosses clothing at this point, you really put in the skin of the character. 
Suddenly, everything is linked. 
You had not long ago 30 years: it has been hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years am delighted. 
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and relishing life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock does not make me afraid. 
I did all the things that I wanted to do for any small and it gave me great pleasure internally. 
Then, then you become mother? 
Of course, I want to become mother because my body wonder and, furthermore, I want to become a young mother; I do not want to lose it. 
As regards the candidate, I am not concerned. 
What I will do is give happiness to my son and raise with a lot of love. 
Turning to the cinema, you expect that the various films that you have turned out last year. 
It is true, I look forward they emerge. 
I am a woman outcome of the theatre, I am very anxious and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible. 
I look forward to ensure the films' última Hora 'and' in busca the tumba of Cristo ". 
To see what you have to think … 
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is it not? 
Do not say it! 
I am not mounted on the bridge for the model. 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know the for a long time, for inviting me to participate in London to a parade of charity for his association in favour of support for women and clothing that we exhibions - I have exhibited two clothing our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for the NGOs of Naomi. 
People that Naomi is a person at the heart strive. 
They say so much about it, I know it, many things are not true. 
Moreover, if this good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to evade for a cause if noble, but if I had to make the Poirier, I would have done anyway. 
The important thing is to make life better for women of the third world. 
Recidivists of drunk driving will install the system 'alcolock' 
The minister of the interior that the driver, who has had more than three administrative sanctions for blood alcohol level, had to install in her vehicle a system which prevents start the vehicle state, or is it not breath. 
The initiative was already announced in June and it now appears in the report of the minister of state in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project which will last for a year. 
Its aim is the rehabilitation of the driver in offering him road rehabilitation courses. 
The minister of state responsible for road safety but also the directorate-general of road safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for the safety of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once state, shows the car. 
The alcolock would prevent this, since it is a system connected with the vehicle that measure the rate of alcohol in the process and to start the vehicle if the driver does not breath before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than permitted. 
The cost is greater than 1 000 euros and is the responsibility of the driver. 
In this respect, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles fitted with this device reduced to 65% of offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure is to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviour before they become criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary waterways but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form, although some commercial and industrial vehicles in service already have a as experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to install on school buses this system as was done in France. 
Mexico without "peep-toes" 
Has 40 p.m, official scheduled time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the princes Asturias travelled presidential hangar touched down in the airport Benito Juárez Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of lie but its force still required to bring a visière to see the royal couple off the plane. 
At the foot of the stairway, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours ago I asked in the street, the taxi driver, though he was aware that the Spanish Princes visiting the city to complete their official trip. 
- Oh, well, at the same time it will not go to the airport to take clients to this CI... you here or then …? 
No no, Mr President, I am Spanish but I lived here thinking two years. 
- Ah, very well … 
But the Mexican press knows very well that the princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the journey. 
They are several waiting in the airport warehouse near the red carpet and a military row consists of 27 of marine soldiers. 
The Prince is smiling and dressed up for Blue navy, Princess, when it was the hair wind, is one dressed very quite soberly and is not its' peep-toes' usual; perhaps they had told him that a storm threatened. 
They are a brief pause to photographers before moving in the room where the official procession awaits them. 
At the door of the hotel where they reside, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a journalist Rigolo Mexican television awaits them. 
The price of the most prestigious way 
There is certainly no appropriate place in the world to present a price way that Paris and there is certainly no cartoonist living more extraordinary and good live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the botón-mango fashion awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new talents of fashion.

Speaking in sleeping 
Few children speak during the night. 
I do not refer to those who wake up very awoke in US reporting something that happened the day before, but children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time that this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it is not important. 
It is a mild alteration sleep, which is called somniloquie. 
It is quite often, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is true that there are more than one who speaks during the night. 
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodical (daily, weekly, monthly...), the day after the child does not remember anything. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other alterations of sleep as the nightmares, the terreurs night, the night énurésies (doing pipi in bed) or the sleepwalking, but this is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever to situations of stress or become agitated. 
In any case it is a little studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which he happens is also very variable. 
It may be that it speaks with a small voice calm, with isolated words, murmurs or instead with shouts of tears,... long speeches 
In cases where the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be good to see the child and to consult an expert, to check if there is a problem which causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that this is a mild upset, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a apnée sleep or stress). 
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventative measures such as: 
Try not to heighten the child before they go to sleep. 
Therefore seek quiet games and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous, and who have the time to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help to calm internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
Soon as the somniloquies appear trying to stay calm. 
Remind you that they are harmless to the child and the next day he does not recall of what happened. 
Useful advice 
The do not waking. 
It is useless because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Although he speaks, he sleeps and is therefore. 
Remind you that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or verify what causes both anxiety among the child. 
If you understand what he said (which is not usual), have not the temptation to ask for information. 
You will get nothing, because in sleeping, he is not aware to organize his thinking. 
Furthermore, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is in the process of dreaming, suddenly made attention to the way in which you interpréterez information and the conclusions you draw from this. 
Never say to the child that you can question him during the night to know his secret. 
Not even in inform. 
This causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don ’ t worry, it is nothing of evil is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern has finally found the road to victory on the ground after a long period of famine. 
Without making a great match, the yellow and black have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a gain for the match. 
The pace was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers have had trouble to speak. 
After a first attempt of captain visitor approaching the Kauffmann lucarne on fire far illhaeusern would take slightly the bottom-up and in turn far fonderflick, and then with Hirn above, Roman, the end of the foot or Diebold came tickle defence of dannemarie. 
In the face, it was block middle ground and it was just the remuant Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The early second half would be decisive with first two occasions and signed Riahi temporale for dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the illhousiens by marshes, well positioned to resume a ball rejected on a first attempt to Diebold (53rd '). 
But the buteur illhousiens will not enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the changing room a dozen minutes later and leaving its coéquipiers in digital inferiority. 
But dannemarie will not know benefit and will not be a major problems to eleven illhousien who has just fallen somewhat for "compact" its defence, except in the last few seconds of game where, after a major cafouillage, the ball was very near the transverse.

Obama, the winner points of the first televised duel 
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has followed another to know whether John McCain or Barack Obama, has won. 
No surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this duel news that would have been followed by a one-third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been enough "brilliant" to allow him to halt the decline in the polls to five weeks of the presidential elections. 
The institute Gallup, including an opinion poll published Saturday gives an advance of five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), believes that it is the Democrat who drew the game. 
Among the undecided voters, which are those that count, Obama as the winner for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the good provision expected of his colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is a good instincts ", however, has warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly put forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first contest. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several occasions. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured. 
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements. 
Obama, he stressed that he represented the future. 
Without apart, he has been concise and specific. 
He highlighted its ability to take the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if", said, this weekend, a accusing of Democratic spot Republican not taking the full extent of the impact of the crisis on the "American" Street. 
"during the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday before 20 000 personnesrassemblées election for a rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain. 
He did not even used the words "middle class" or "workers". "the financial advantage clearly Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most able to save the economy on the brink of the abyss. 
"The coming week could be a turning point,", yesterday, the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, has compared the "good economic instincts" Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democrat candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that he would still to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois has also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence in the country by the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a system of assurance-santé. 
McCain, he wished to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030. 
Careful, both candidates have avoided questions about the financial rescue plan $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday evening by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opponents were Sunday evening on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject in advance of the parliamentary results. 
A few hundreds of Belarussians gathered Sunday evening at the polling stations closed on the central square in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation". 
Some that they did not even voted: "What is good, since they will do what they want my voice," said a young. 
They do not believe that the regime has done well to foreign observers in order to resume talks with the European Union is prepared to carry out a Democratic breakthrough. 
The sanctions, including the ban of visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered own by observers. 
They have not been according in the opposition. 
"We have been excluded electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the count," said Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties. 
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that counts the votes, and for us, it is the executive. 
If the members of the opposition come in parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into parliament may mean the area on television, meetings in the regions and the draft laws. " 
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "it must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote. 
She pointed out that the participation figures are too high, and that the spread of advance (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulation. 
"You have noticed that there was an election, you ask the Social Democrat leader Alexander Kazulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no nobody in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those that are best suited in power. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place October. 
For the television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomes their success. 
The interview - blood become course 
Héma-québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine décary, had reason to rejoice, because héma-québec has become one of the safest blood suppliers and effective security in the world. 
Above all, he has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously undermined by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As you know, the national reserves of blood transfusion service run by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the virus of acquired immune (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
Before this tragedy and the public resentment, Canada's government has established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace Krever investigation, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster does not happen again. 
While the judge Krever was to submit his report, some provinces have set up a committee aimed to plan a new system of management of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee gélineau has fulfilled this mandate. 
Following the reports gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: héma-québec to serve the Quebec and Canadian society blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"in 1998, when héma-québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Dre décary. 
The situation was daunting. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and on the ground during the years that followed, we returned to the public confidence, "said before proudly say that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population now had confidence in héma-québec. 
The Dre décary guard in mind however that "Trust is something extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, héma-québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, we were in Europe to the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells that takes strong since its inception in 1998. 
"And we do not know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
It is then relied on one of the main recommendations of Krever and gélineau reports that when it does not know and that a serious disease, can result in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterised by degeneration of the brain, leading inevitably to death, it introduces measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, it therefore refused the blood of people who had been more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
However, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode also showed that the precautionary principle has been applied had sense. " 
In 1999 appeared on the market a much more sensitive for HIV testing: nucléique acid (TAN), which can detect directly in the blood donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, underpinning the tests used hitherto. 
The tan helped to shorten the period silent, between the moment when the person has been infected and that when the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
We could reduce this period to less than a week. 
It was substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and that we can detect. 
These improvements have helped considerably to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"In other words, this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As héma-québec distributes each year between 000 400 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before occurs a case of HIV transmission by a blood product. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health ", says the head of the direction of héma-québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never knows what pathogen will emerge in the system. 
No later than last year appeared on the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
You have to be constantly vigilant, "continues the Dre décary before noted that in addition to a secure supply, héma-québec must also provide a sufficient supply. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is aging. 
Cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red blood cells or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the network of blood donors who has an average of 3% of the eligible to donate blood. " 
Any person in health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria may yet give blood all 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those who propose blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where there is rife, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory which meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give their blood. 
It is difficult to persuade people to give their blood, but especially to hold them and encourage them to become regular donor. 
Today's life is so rampant rarely the time to spend an hour to give its blood, "laments Francine décary. 
With an annual budget of $297 million, héma-québec provides not only of blood products, but also of human tissues, including bone, bone heart valves, Globes and eye and skin that is almost exclusively used for burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in héma-québec, which also manages the only public of cord blood bank in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord which was once considered a biomedical waste a lot of rich in blood stem cells can be used to treat serious illnesses, such as leukaemia. 
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the Bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and it will take more than a thousand per year. 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says the Dre décary describes this programme to levy umbilical cord blood as very popular. 
"Several mums are disappointed to have access to them," because héma-québec does not have the means to propose this complex and costly in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer – the impact in the semi-finals 
The impact of Montreal has qualified for the semi-finals round of the series in the first division of the usl, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive game of the series quarters in total goals in stage Saputo. 
The middle ground Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play. 
After a first half without purpose of both sides, the middle ground and David testo Rocco plancentino marked the other nets montréalaise training. 
Roger Levesque was the only one to outflank Matt Jordan for the Sounders. 
Remember that in the first game of the series and, on Friday, the impact had suffered a defeat of 2-1 at the starfire complex, Tukwila, in a suburb of Seattle. 
The impact will be measured in the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals. 
Saturday night at the Minnesota, has filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the whitecaps have even come round to the semi-finals 5-4 in total goals. 
The impact should confront the whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today. 
In short – aim victorious victorious Kovalev 
The trio of the Canadian number one is prepared to undertake the season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a gain of 3-2 to the Canadian artillery barrage against the Florida Panthers, yesterday evening, at the Bell Centre. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec has raised two aid, and Kovalev scored a happening in the gain, the fourth of six tricolour preparatory games. 
Kovalev gave the victory in striking the sole aim of the shooting. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another match to feel comfortable. " 
"He tried to do too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau. 
But I think it has appreciated the end of the match. 
He had a beautiful ovation. " 
Charest put on the North 
The prime minister does not exclude trigger elections before the end of the year 
Immediately after the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest was made yesterday in Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of the by-election today. 
"push the limits of our last great northern border": that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest was presented with visual force while remaining within the broad lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, at lévis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech was projected a kind of Mill images. 
Turning, loop on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google maps", maps, etc. 
Major resources as electoral period. 
In press point, moreover, the prime minister refused to rule out that it would trigger elections this autumn, although he noted that his schedule was very busy. 
The "plan North" is the fourth part of a "vision" that Prime Minister claimed for Quebec, that of a "new" economic area, which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech by Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory in the 49th Parallel - had never made a presentation. 
The prime minister is however resorted to explain why the North was "a jewel of huge potential", but has not given deadline, amount of investment, or specific priority in the future plans. 
At most a few avenues of what could be developed further, including the hydro-electricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, has boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "Nickel, zinc, copper, gold, silver, money, iron, titanium and even diamonds," according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This "territory twice as large as France", "it is among us, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is among us, but it is with us, "he insisted, as to demonstrate that it has demanded a national founding myth. 
The Quebec is much built in its relations with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, québécoise engineering, James Bay. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after having a dramatic pause to contemplate the huge map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebecois territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the prime minister at the point of press. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government, "he said. 
The rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open throughout the year because of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the first nations and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially for young people. 
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel létourneau (former member of ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities. 
A committee chaired by Benoît Council and in which Julie Burden (transport and natural resources) has an important place began work. 
The prime minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will be a common vision." 
The northern development would be elsewhere in conformity with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan will be "North concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuity with the prime minister liberals that preceded it. 
"As the liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the recurring themes of the end of the week, which has begun Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the beauharnois in central adélard-godbout dam. 
"godbout, who created Hydro-Québec Lesage, who made the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest. 
In conservative point of press, he cited another reference, this one, the programme "roads to the north" of John diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydro-electric dam project of eastmain1a-ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its implementation was scheduled for 2012. 
"It remains between us here, but I will be there," he entrusted to its militants, causing home sustained applause. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering an election this autumn, what the law allows. 
He stresses that his schedule is however completed, including a mission of the Council of the Federation in China and a top québec-new York. 
The general council of the week has provided the Liberal leader a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including 'constitutional aspirations "went as a letter to the position: the plq calls in particular the recognition" specificity of Quebec "in the Constitution. 
It also hope that the Quebec appoints members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad outlines of the plan North with scepticism. 
The chief péquiste, Pauline Marois, has emerged the development policy that the government nord-du-québec Landry was launched in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government in coming to power in 2003, has refused to apply. 
If it did, "it would be more advanced today" commented Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (elections took place today), Françoise mercury. 
The ADQ said supported the adoption of a northern plan by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is on holiday today. 
Letters - a country dishonoured 
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of the "justice" (O irony) in the cabinet Harper, who allowed last summer to say Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada. 
Throw the stigma on this woman who led a constant struggle for justice and which deserves our admiration said as long on the entourage of prime minister on Stephen Harper himself. 
We are faced with a government that is the only, among all Western countries involved, not to have brought back its national locked in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
A government which takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that are accused. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its floor and lets in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, for the record, that Unicef, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he received a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this government that condone torture: little it is important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of violence. 
It does not yet account, but at the moment we are seeing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word that Harper continues to raise and whom if hollow in his mouth. 
The time has come, where no moral no longer exists: it is abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the whim of a head of government here so minority (what about after the October 14...). 
Number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, it is in this renunciation and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion — the Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, the duty has published a letter from Mr Patrick J. J Garver, deputy director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, it says that the largest gold company in the world has brought a continuation of defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "public debate transparent". 
It is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they consider, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely masked by Ms Garver. 
As for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own? 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book black Canada will spend large sums to prepare their defence and weapons to fight, very unequal, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without substance of the mining. 
The tactic in these struggles unequal, is also often ruining the defendants to impose an amicable solution which bâillonnera opposition to frighten anyone dare look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is to the public that it was to present its vision of the facts. 
Unlike in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally by the exchange of ideas and not with club. 
It was enough to the mining to open its books, records and to establish a true debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust the public opinion and rejected out of hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how it can ask a debate "public" while disregard the opinions of the same public? 
In the world of vice-president, it appears that this word is only highly paid filled and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, the critics have the right to speak. 
What does not – or does not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of black Canada the fact primarily because it rejects the mining of the brutal manner. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized trade arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also table a formal notice to the place of the authors of black Canada calling on them to stop the use of the term...). 
Beyond the speech surreal of Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society. 
It denies, en bloc, the right to the quotation from credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under threat of prosecution repeat, who can do it? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate and transparent, it could do this by following the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic world, to which we belong, has long known to manage the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims it has no desire for a debate transparent. 
This is a loss for the academic world, just as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place arrangements restricting such abusive prosecutions. 
Rescue operation Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have finally arrived at an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion US dollars to curb the financial crisis that rocking Wall Street for months must still be approved by both houses of Congress. 
It includes: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new measures to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, as well as a right of review on salaries paid to executives of companies helped. 
U.S Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news for a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon negotiations in two days. 
"We have made great progress of an agreement which will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything was done in order to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans to the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: If we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours by fear of the effect that would lead to another failure on the investor sentiment. 
The time limit that we had paid was the opening of markets this morning. 
Associates late in the negotiations, the two candidates to the American presidential election were rather favourable to the agreement, without fail however to express their dissatisfaction that we are obliged to come to this end. 
The senator Democrat Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly to allow homeowners to keep their homes and that on the wages of business leaders rescapées by the state. 
"When we ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because the irresponsibility of some, it is not much to be welcomed. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves on American television. 
About another channel to see whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The broad lines that I have read [show] that is something that we will all have to digest and with which we shall be able to move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said. 
The plan aims to buy 700 billion with taxpayers' money the bad debts, active at risk and of American financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk () before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (pcaa) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans who had ruined the first draft of understanding last week. 
It believes to be out of this impasse since the Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
To cut corners for everyone in Congress, it has also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion which will add another 100 billion if the president considers necessary. 
The payment of 350 other billion should be ratified by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange for his help, Washington will have holdings in companies rescued it worth of dividends in case of profit and that it will sell when the turmoil will be passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the property loans concerned by this plan, and to set limits on the pay and expenses of departure paid to leaders of the companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would see put to the vote in the House of Representatives from today, and that the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued yesterday to protest against this project, both in the Republican camp that Democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington do not hear you," said the address of its voters the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the finance committee of the house. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not one that is to take advantage of the taxpayers ". 
Promoter of a small group to Congress dubbed "caucus sceptics", the representative Democrat Brad Sherman present things differently, but came to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors of economy, including three Nobel Prize, we wrote to tell us: we ask the Congress not hurry and carefully examine the path to take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe was once again the evidence of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas said it was giving to acquire its competitor trouble since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the housing crisis loans at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 major European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, we regain the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
This is something that savers and households now appreciate that the time looks uncertain. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the channel, the British government seemed path to nationalise another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take on board all loans going on at the bank Bradford and bringley, including more than 41 billion 75,5 billion (US) of mortgages. 
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and accounts customers of the British bank. 
The Bradford and bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government should nationalise since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
Its beauty in the eyes of blue was long its card asset, some would say its weakness. 
If he was released from the mirror narcissique, the American actor at smile Charmeur? 
Yes and no. 
Its sensitivity, his sensitivity and a talent flowing to source will also have removed from the register of power that the real enfante sacred monsters. 
But what great runner of substance! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years of follow-up of lung cancer in its better yet, invite him the Connecticut, remains one of the last American cinema of the good years. 
Less monumental that Brando, who he was and how he was long a kind of rival to the screen, more cautious in its game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle freedom and the collapse of dramatic conventions. 
Blood children are often mixed beautiful children. 
It is born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots will generate a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without huge ego, ultimate stamp of quality. 
Because he is threw a whole country enamored of self made man, the combating of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s dramatic art at Yale then attended the actor' 's studio in New York, before triumph in theatre, television, soon to film. 
The same man who milita for the civil rights was also the pilot cars, which are classa second in the 24 hours of man ’ s in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with him the areas of this star secret, discreet, committed, allergic to pieces of show-business, which we will not entirely pit the conundrum. 
An honest man, in the truest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman gave the afraid of heights dizzying moviegoers this weekend, while collide its major roles on the black screen memories. 
More than half a century of a seventh American art on fast changing around him. 
Return to compete in memory the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the chatte on a roof burning adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closest to us (1990), discussing his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage which does not fulfil all its promises. 
As other Paul Newman switched to history. 
This boxeur rocky Graziano, offender, agitated, violent, unforgettable in somebody up there likes me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956. 
This sympathetic pleasant in the brillantissime the sting (the scam), Oscar for the best film in 1973. 
Pong bitter player and vengeur in the magnificent the hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the man on the return in the color of money of Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987 its sole Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
Yet him. 
The Times have been squeezed through its journey. 
The young are mainly through the cultissime slap shot George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an ice hockey team unorthodox. 
Its fans have recovered in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen brothers. 
With a final role of the Irish Mafia godfather in road to distress Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
Unlike many stories of films which lâchèrent soon enough profession, Newman will remained remained in saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its T, its boom and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier the considered, not without humour, "as a challenge living in" The underplaying "judging its benefits too supported. 
The profession has not always been kind to the beautiful Paul Newman to which the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
He played less often young people first that the marginal: névrosés, alcoholic swines or desperate, including its features perfect reflétèrent abuses and the revolt. 
As director, Newman proved understood facets of its true sensitivity pudique. 
His Rachel, Rachel in 1968 (based on the saga of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traçait a end female portrait of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott overdose by him dédia his film Harry and his in 1984, work modest and sadness. 
Among the rain of tributes that déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in the sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated very saddened: "Its presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love the existence are all features of the player disappeared. 
Beyond his career of legend, was lost as a great civil rights activist, ecology, the independent film, a maverick Hollywood drifts. 
We have seen much his binette trôner on pots of dressing, sauces, biscuits and other foods, assessing the process of fairly bad taste, albeit gag at the outset. 
The profits from these sales were nonetheless paid to its foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on its myth, is committed until the end. 
It has left its five girls a letter containing these phrases: "always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be here. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist if lucid and generous. 
In sum, model citizen and in addition. 
That could well make Zuschlag & amp; company factory in their bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will start the hearings relating to criminal proceedings against jános Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanently and regular, having a particularly significant damage. Other charges were brought against them, as for example, false and use of false. 
According to the prosecutor, money from subsidies, was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million huf in total, would a share in the coffers of fiatal movement baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, made public also by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money grants obtained by issuing invoices fees, behind which no real provision was provided and the associations do not meet their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false. 
For these, they acquired the books of invoices to the market of józsefváros, while they made stamps to kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies that would be on the bills, it was decided, among other things, during tours to the province north of Lake balaton, carried out by istván lados, on request of jános Zuschlag. 
According to the evidence of this last year, he had to identify pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked a bill, on the model of which they imparting the other bills that they would introduce, among other things, with the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the municipality of the capital for access to subsidies. 
The majority of invoices was created by istván lados and his accomplice, andrás őri, which according to our information, was especially to write the documents needed to obtain grants. 
During a "circuit tracking", a choice of lados was a bistro. 
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Association biztos egyesület bridge. 
However, in the words of the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people in this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the drawn up on behalf of the foundation jobb Foundation, which subsequently bear the name of együtt has harmadik, évezredért of failings of form and substance. 
A pension, located in badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three chambers, and maximum ten people can spend the night. However, the bill was one hundred and thirty customers. 
Issuers of bills to the imagination are also fell in excess, when they mentioned the company pigal KFT, owned the hotel and catering sector. In their accounting, or the name of jobb jövőért, or the hoppá do not appear, according to the information to the public prosecutor. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, said the site hvg.hu that when the public prosecutor has called and showed him the bills, he knew, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp." 
He added: "beyond the form, the fact that, according to the bill, one hundred people have housed there, do not collait either, since this establishment has only eleven Chambers, who do not have much room. 
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and the restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
Issuers of invoices zealous are not informed on travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but not organizing that travel abroad. Thus, they have indicated stays in Hungary on the bills to settle in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency. 
In addition, as it became clear during the investigation, they ajoutèrent also VAT on these documents, while the provision concerning the activities of trips, including the destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Similarly, the VAT rate of four bills established in the name of the hotel révfülöp in the order of jövőért jobb was incorrect, since the benefits of society do not bear a vat of 25% as indicated, but a vat of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel does that emit printed bills, while the false were written by hand. 
The investigation of the prosecutor shows that the "issuers" have also made errors in the provision the transport of goods by road, that the company issuing bills could not exercise, given that his profile was the council in investment. 
It is also for defects of forms, such as types of invoices inadequate and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of együtt has harmadik évezredért alapítvány, XXI. Századi kulturális egyesület and biztos bridge proved false. 
Just as in the case of bt. Ravenna society or the sports kunfehértó, who both deny the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf. 
Counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that the company Hib KFT., based in nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the group of fiatal városért egyesület was supposed to take a meal home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of society denies issued this bill. 
Established bills deliberately 
Another category of issuers bills is composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to make the fictitious bills. 
The foundation esély budapestért alapítvány, at the request of the group of fiatal baloldal - ifjú szocialisták, has established a bill to the order of the foundation has együtt harmadik évezredért, for a total of four million huf. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab kft. was forced to make false bills by one of the accused, Ludovic györfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company biogate KFT., which is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, has issued bills to the order of the foundation jobb jövőért alapítvány, the association and the Association egyesület atlasz vörösfenyő egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million huf but behind which no provision has been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices issued were cancelled by the result, but that the agencies have avoided mentioning it in their accounts. 
The next category of issuers bills is that companies are directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the delegate's administrative director general of society Delta trió KFT., dealing with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles, including the headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was nowhere to be found, was Iván kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, this company has issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of approximately 18 million huf. 
According to the survey, these devices have been bought by the society cash investment kft. of kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation 14 since September 2005. 
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, who Iván kubatov would also have sent documents in connection with the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
From what we know, kubatov acknowledged during the investigation he issued invoices to the order of atlasz companies, hoppá and együtt has harmadik évezredért alapítvány, and that he has earned their exchange equivalent. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván kubatov of builders Romanians have created companies fa-bani Jos faipari kft. and jos-investment BT. 
In fact, none of these companies do not worked, what the accused explained by the fact that they do not receive work. 
He served when even these companies, since at the request of master Zsolt szente, coaccusé and editor of acts of founding companies, he established the Bills to their names in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag associations, such as the atlasz and y-generáció. 
Kubatov gave the organizations, in total, 15 invoices issued by companies cash investment, Delta trió, fa-bani Jos, Jos investment and linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million huf. 
The prosecution believed that 10% of the amount indicated on the invoices and VAT went in the pocket of kubatov. 
Man has even used the company szi-beri bt. to set up fictitious bills that have been used in the context of the grant application of biztos bridge. 
In January 2006, the association y-generáció and szövetség a modern magyarországért filed an application with the organization of public utility of the Socialist Party, táncsics mihály alapítvány (MRI). 
They have achieved this subsidy to a figure of 500 000 huf twice, but these figures have not been used for the objectives included in the request. 
To avoid that does know, five bills fictitious received from society works team kft. were presented to the MRI. 
Moreover, it is these bills that have been found in the raid in the office of árpád kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, some of the accused will tell the method of manufacture of invoices, as it had already done before the floor earlier. 
What could be really interesting is that the main accused, jános Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on the whole history. 
Until now, its confessions are not very detailed, and although he had promised on several occasions to tell the smallest detail, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement which in exchange for the payment of a large part of the 50 million huf, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably insulted, since the applications for its placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of its conditions of detention, constantly fall on deaf ears. 
While those who have caused far greater damage, and the authors of economic crimes beyond repair, roam or at least, in their own home the end of the procedure. It does not have this possibility. 
The psychology of the one-upmanship: Why dépense-t-on more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
Researchers in neurology and economics from the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic bases this behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be stance in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price. 
These searches have tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this type of "game" with the help of experimental auctions. 
A voluntary groups playing in lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), researchers the areas of the brain active experimental subjects. 
In the two games, the participants could earn money, but during the auction an essential element is the increased by a third, all located in the strokes, called striatum, were in intensive way movement in the loss of game. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism D "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is with the flight to the violent reaction of striatum. 
The support of their theories, economists members of this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision. 
During these three groups surenchérissaient faced with a partner, in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the group control of the real value of the product in question, and they have done their implementation. 
Another group, they have promised that if, in addition, they went the winner of the party, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but members of the group also lose money if they lose the auction. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was among the one in the victory, while in the other, on failure. 
In proving the possibility of neurologists, members of the team players "against failure" were prepared to put higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory". 
"These results cannot be proven by any existing economic theory. 
Indeed, each of them are explained the phenomena found at auction by the pleasure to win and the parade before the risk. 
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now, on a third explanation. '- found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York. 
The Hepatitis: when do we consult a doctor? 
In the world, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the main causes of death. 
It is estimated 100 miles patients carriers of the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is due to the fact that people often do not know that they are carriers of the virus. 
The name is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different virus. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristics, but the pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other. 
The virus of hepatitis, according to the genes, pathogens spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated), the hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body liquids (semen, vaginal secretion, spittle). 
For travellers, it is in any way recommended to be vaccinated against viruses and B. There is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis has is two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a general bad state, weakness, stomach pains and nausea. 
Then develop on the skin and eye on the White jaunisse visible, a should become clearer and urine takes a darker. Healing can take two to three weeks. 
World, each year, a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or the cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only a patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the gene pathogen destroyed sneaky liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appeared that after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, consumers of drugs and the tatoués. 
Currently, this figure to 200 million patients from chronic hepatitis C type in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a review of routine in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult his doctor at the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed to this, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is warned. 
On 30 September is the day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world. 
Its objective is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and the importance of the early diagnosis of the disease. 
Anyone is growing in God less pain? 
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would operate as a kind of pain reliever, which would have helped to make more bearable death of Catholic martyrs. 
The British Daily Telegraph published an article in which researchers from the University of Oxford made an interesting experience in analyzing what level the belief in God could influence tolerance for the pain of the human being. 
In the framework of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 believers Catholic and as many have been subjected to ECT, while each of them was a painting representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the believers Catholics were able to exclude a large part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique palpation of the human brain, they could also find that Catholics have been able to activate the part of the brain responsible for regulating the pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which académiciens, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from various sectors of the university. 
More specifically, the experience is as follows: an instrument tinsel flames and broadcasting the ECT is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
The researchers asked participants to the experience of watching supported two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato the 17th century and the other, the woman to the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. 
Researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of painting of da Vinci, not very different from the first, focused on its calming effect. 
The experimental subjects have spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, meanwhile, have received 20 ECT in four part is after, while watching the paint religious theme, is the more general issue. 
Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone who is "take care" and they are "quiet, and the peace invaded". 
In the view of the thematic painting religious, they have reported 12% of pain in less than when they were watching the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself has taken part in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image among atheists, provided to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find a picture with which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, indeed our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, it is more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain issues if we show the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same size? 
Does the sight of a Virgin Mary of better quality would lead to better results? 
You are what you divulgues about tone 
Has the opportunity to its tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way as the skies over their head. He knows where they have spent their holidays, they should consult specialists and what are their interests. 
This is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of influential people in society. 
As regards the sceptics establishing a parallel with the Orwellian horror vision, they do not see precisely the bulk of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal which was as follows: "in a system all information in the world!". 
According to the leader of Google asked, after ten years of a global chamboulement work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives to treat all the information. 
That was the question: will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that I would be better?". However, the software will not be able to answer this question, simple at first glance, that the day when they know enough about users. 
It is not quite clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that the research and the pages then consulted by interested parties are listed. 
Through the programme personalized search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own history of research and can see what they sought, whereupon they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if we look at what is my work? ask users, who worry about seeing the monopoly on information from Google. 
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by the company can cause fear, and this is not the compunction, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can generate with the Internet a contre-réaction. 
However, it is a fact confirmed that the terms are sought not only registered, but in cases justified, they are sent to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most resounding example of these days is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilians, during which Google has sent to the Brazilian government information he had collected on the page public called Orkut, allowing an identification. 
Internet users concerned with human rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, top arm below with the body of legal protection electronically EFF, has proved its right, the court with the FBI. According to the decision, in the future, Google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the application of the FBI, secret whatsoever. 
(At the same time, the federal government has been successfully some 50 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms that he had won in relation to the strengthening of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years ago. But in the end, it fails to obtain lists of private research users, or the whole list of Web sites and words of these two months.) 
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is attacked by those who fear the transmission of personal data, because they believe that their intimate sphere and their private sphere suffer when they begin to use the Google services. Therefore, they are responding to them in the spirit of rebellion that is against the multinationals proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "sauvageons" with the fans, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer, which appear in many countries see Google in the next generation of big business, the "Corporation trendy" as opposed to its rival, Microsoft invader, classified as the world because of windows, even if all the two are fighting for the same objective. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users of identification code, asking for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programmes, constantly refreshed, has an effect much more accessible, younger and more cool, faced with the practice of the official software giant. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and that the Web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed in recent years, is right behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something that cooperation, that the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we serve the channels of communication available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: are exposed. 
A young, in general, can take a profile on several public pages, Facebook to xanga, and it can even connect them to other benefits, such as for example in twinter, or Last.FM listant musical habits. Then it can connect them to a system of prosecution, as FriendFeed or blip.fm. these young people can also take blogs, in which appear automatically their latest photo galleries they store on Flickr or on Picasa. 
While it may take many examples, such as the girlfriend which includes easily to the order of the photos in the morning, taken by the circle of friends in common, with which his friend infidel spent the evening, or the society that has dismissed one of his employees, just to the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog on the top management, we may be on one thing: the term privacy is totally to reconsider our days. 
Those who live a life online, consists of what it shows itself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of young people today. 
That wants to hide something, or at least, to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do so (starting, for example, with scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, leaving intentionally no trace). 
The number of people who deliberately, does not record on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not insignificant. The Google services online, via the text to the treatment of image, reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to enormous parks servers and who do not gather our best profile, having existed to date. 
The public expects without really to hiding, when Google revealed its true nature. 
The society, with its present value of 156 billion, is more than IBM ($140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion). The AdWords / AdSense advertising areas threaten turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of important cause serious headache not only to Microsoft, but many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers criticisms are, in addition to this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of kindergarten and business after the society has deemed too expensive restoration multiple daily, taken at any time. This seems to be little pales beside the fact that already in 2006, Google has agreed to the Chinese government and according to the terms of the agreement, the company detected all results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to an internal rules of society, the new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on is that in the coming months and years, they are moving the world on new points. That some believe that the draft scan and filing of books and magazines dimensions Google is so important that society will soon find themselves facing the United States Supreme Court, other tremble before its health system, because in it, we can build a comprehensive medical benefit from our results of previous analyses our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of fiction writers. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with demi-tons orwelliens, described the future in which a man could be approached to alarming levels just through data from Google. 
Two minors have helped to remove traces of the double homicide of ózd 
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of ózd. According to suspicion, they helped to remove traces of crime", said the spokesman for the Department of borsod station. 
Young people have recognised the facts which they are accused. At the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, who, according to the information of brief agency MTI (Hungarian) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The complicity of murder can entail a detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect the double homicide of ózd, a young man in the corner of 23 years old, was placed in detention, Sunday. 
The charges against him are homicide multiple, committed with premeditation and by interest. 
During the investigation, it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not want to settle its debt and it is for this reason that he drew its creditor, last Wednesday in a site of ózd where he was killed, as well as the daughter of the man, aged 9 years. 
According to the information the MTI, the young man was premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was to commit their crimes hidden on the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police examines the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of experts. 
The award of Warsaw made a proposal for the purchase of the Prague stock exchange 
The Warsaw stock exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the package of shares of the values of stock Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the stock exchange of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that Poles have made despite that, previously, the Czechs have excluded the Warsaw stock the circle of potential new owners of the stock market in Prague. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock lies in the hands of the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wants to be separated from more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities. 
According to the daily Czech economic E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer has been made to date for the purchase of the stock of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the Vienna of exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr koblic, the director of the market of Prague, said last week that those involved, the Warsaw stock market would be the new owner The less good, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the market in Prague in the future. 
The value of the stock market in Prague is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by experts in the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold. 
The largest owner of the stock in Prague is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25% of holdings, followed by the FF 147 percent of the bank ceská sporitelna and the tiger holding oven S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis is worsening day by day, the leaders of the European press newspapers are already a "second 11 September". 
"The overall financial disaster, it is the American President" - accuses the Rome daily La Repubblica. "the president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised hurriedly to rescue a depressing situation..." 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
Part of the Madrid Press also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership there which has led the world economy on the brink of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system accroit every day, and subsequently, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote of the Congress, a real threat that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the void, just at the moment in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place. 
We cannot ignore the threat longer – highlights the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some member states can still be a lifeline to their financial organizations, and thanks to titubants money from their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing such Domino, then neither money nor new improvisations will not be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need the member states of the European Union did little cases of their national egoism, and they centralized control over financial markets divided. 
Nothing that Monday, financial institutions have weakened received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the daily Viennese, der standard, which adds that the fears that the European taxpayers also will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to resolve the crisis, are becoming more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really involved in the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crosses, hand in hand, the old continent. 
The "sauveteurs" should not raise immediately EUR 100 billion euros, however it would be wise if they indicated in which case it would be sensible to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage. 
The intelligent car following of the flight of Bourdon 
What method would be best to develop technologies able to avoid an obstacle, if this is not the imitation of a detector obstacles that already exist in nature? 
As example, the bees. 
In the project surprising presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, bees bourdonnantes gave the idea of strategic basis for engineers from Nissan to inspire the on how they should develop the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system to order, bio-inspiré auto-robotisé type br23c, he has equipped qualities of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system that can avoid all obstacles. 
During flights, each bee is its own area, oval, which in reality, very similar to our Hull secure protection - explained at the exhibition, kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department research and technological development and public relations of the mark. 
The eye to aspects of the bee plays an important role, because it is able to see in all directions, in a corner of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have raised the idea of Laser range-finder. 
It identifies obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the br23c, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor of board, into which the Avoidance Manoeuvre immediately. 
The perception of the obstacle was held in a fraction of a second. Then the mini car robot, emulating the movements of the bees, immediately change the direction of his wheels in the shift from light enough to avoid a collision. 
Unlike all existing system, this manoeuvre of avoidance goes entirely instinctively. 
"If it is not the case, the mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki andoh, the director of the laboratory mobility project and car. 
It must respond instinctively and instant, since this technology is the layer the most vulnerable and the most internal envelope a layer of protection, which for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
This whole process must reflect what the bee done to avoid other bees. 
The process must take place in the blink of an eye. 
The opposite of bees, the difference cannot be upwards or downwards, diagonal, it cannot be that two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, to the place of endless combinations that have bees to avoid other bees, in our case, it was unable to use the rotatif movement, the acceleration and the slowdown as manoeuvres in the provision of the mini car robot 
The br23c uses polymère lithium batteries that are lighter and whose concentrated energy is greatest, which makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version. 
According to andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction which is important, not the data processing, and even less the ability to store. 
This mechanism must deal with some incoming signals per second, and respond to them. 
It is not necessary to the store and to react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilo-octets memory in continues. 
We do not need a memory capacity of gigabits, or even méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the concept of a technology used to instant avoidance. According to the estimates of Nissan, this system will be entry in cars manufactured in number in the next ten years. 
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination in avoiding obstacles situated on its way. 
It has even named the baby out of price 
The written version of the economic rescue plan $700 billion to buy the credits doubtful of banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent. 
Reuters announced during new debates are extending until after midnight Saturday, local time on the East Coast, the leaders of Congress to agreement on the existing controversy for days and days around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion. 
"We have taken a significant step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the US House of Representatives, according to which there more than do the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan is supported by two candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, said in a comment on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and be effective, however other measures to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, on Sunday night at pm local time Washington (i.e Monday at 2 a.m in the morning, according to the local time of central Europe), but has not resulted in a dramatic rise in the stock markets. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding on behalf of Emergency Economic Stabilization of 2008. Secondly, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W Bush spoke to Pelosi, then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the advanced attacks that night, and We greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House. 
Moreover, the programme differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which it stated that the $700 billion would be spent at once, to buy securities on dubious appropriations. 
Now, more than half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably Monday. This first sum for the Treasury secretary to buy bad debts of banks, while the use of an additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the president. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part. 
The expense of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the Secretariat to the Treasury will implement a combined strategy: it can, at the same time, buy bad debts, securities on mortgages and suspicious of mortgages and other types of debt "toxic". 
The relevant people of the Ministry stated that takeovers can take place in an auction, but also directly. 
Rule provides an opportunity for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program, where the secretariat to the Treasury guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson has said that the law provides the tools necessary in order to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether the vast buyback of dubious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system entrainant the collapse of a major financial institution or another. 
"We will take the necessary arrangements to be prepared for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added. 
In contrast, the leaders of the banks located in poor and waiting for state aid can expect their redundancy payments, called simply golden parachute overseas, will be limited by the government. 
The salary cap is mentioned only in specific cases. In addition, the limitations will depend on how the secretariat to the Treasury proposes assistance to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the secretariat to the Treasury buying in an auction, they prélèveront a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the bank president discredited based on retirement. 
Directly after the purchase of bad debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not an exaggeration. 
If the image is complete, it should be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap is that the new contracts, having to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that the legal ceilings will be in force regarding the allowances of directors general - commented on the president of the commission in charge of financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state provides a right of acquiring shares in banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of falling taxpayers, since they can even be winner in the matter as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved rebound on their feet. 
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the president must introduce to Congress a proposal which will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there were, of course, those who have expressed their doubts over the plan. 
This does not mean that American citizens we have commissioned, this does not protect the taxpayers' dollars - said the California Republican member, Darrell Issa. 
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur believe that the same people pull the taking of measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Barack Obama and McCain both support the plan to rescue banks 
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major parties Americans have given their support to the government's rescue plan $700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary. 
After negotiations marathons, that lasted for days and days, the representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue banks. 
This financing plan, aimed at the thawing of the crisis on Wall Street and the credit market paralysed, became the central issue of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are each even as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a bit ahead. Advance of McCain, achieved with the nomination of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, has melted. 
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama has expressed its hope that the Congress vote quickly the law on the 700 billion rescue plan. 
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that it also supports. 
"It is now that we must act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your savings, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35 000 people.

Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House vote on the bill as Monday. 
The Press review of the German language territory 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - and mentioned the Der Spiegel, the low score of the Bavarian CSU in the country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In Internet publishing the information magazine left German, Franz Walter analysis the causes of the defeat of the CSU drama in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers". 
According to this political scientist recognized, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad duo beckstein-huber its office. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed Bavaria for decades now, these same citizens that their modern are turning back. 
This change of time is at the same time the problem of any democracy Christian, and also that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but Sunday, came to an end a process that was likely there is this, just ten years: the hegemony of the national party was completed. 
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU is collecting with 47,7 percent for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, i.e at the time of so mentioned Stoiber. 
The issue can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring his parents, put in place in the region consistently by the CSU. 
It is 40 years that sociologists announce this but they are very wrong about rhythm. However secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans north and east in the region of Bavaria, booming, could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who are rather remote from the CSU, such as the independent, artisans, the holders of the BAC and graduates of higher studies. 
In these groups, the support of the CSU has fallen below 40 percent. 
Die Press (diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "who?? with the president of party on the reserve are dealing with the issues of the coalition," the Austrian newspaper conservative with the situation of the domestic policy confused that came after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialists the SPÖ wish to discuss with the conservative ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiations. The greens do not want yet to agree on the coalition. 
The elections were held now, everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held in public television, party leaders have barely have suggested their cards. 
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of both parties is actually possible - it is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, schüssel-molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molterer responded with caution to the proposals of the red. 
As he has already said, a collaboration will be fruitless if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Austrian ÖVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is currently a matter entirely open. These points must be debated within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to all new proposals. 
"to avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume responsibilities" government - said Haider. 
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, started, in Paris, the European summit for equal opportunities, including the host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons consultation of experts lívia járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, has drawn attention to the segregation in education, because it is a violation of the right which is most Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French minister of labour and social affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, we find the European Social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civilian organizations in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of the popular party Fidesz member járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found the recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, first, as a result of their low qualification. 
"The overwhelming majority of young Roma have no secondary degrees, and as a result of a poor quality basic education, only a tiny fraction has the opportunity to obtain a higher education." 
Furthermore, járóka has insisted that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role when it must make other fundamental rights. 
The investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to be aware of these reports in a circle the widest possible, also between Roma and non-Roma. 
Indeed, earlier a Roma children start school, the more it increases his chances of becoming a productive members of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and its consumption, he participated in the state budget. 
"By their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected and low quality education sectarian. '- stressed lívia járóka. 
According to the Honourable member, a collaboration of the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of Desegregation of schools. For this, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of vital importance. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - has demanded járóka. 
On behalf of the European "year of equal opportunities" guaranteed for all, the objective of the summit for equal opportunities in Europe organised every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single platform for support measures in favour of equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and the level of member states. 
CSU: the pardon for a transitional period 
It is in October that will be made the decision on the fate of the duo toppled 
Despite this pathetic electoral failure, heads are still not fallen, and the debate on the personal questions the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is: when will last until the grace? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17%, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held last weekend in October. 
The members of this pair very criticised, in any case, felt that they were not specifically to their seats. 
Thanks to this, they are employed to appease angry members of the group and the basis, a day after the "tsunami" Bavarian demanded of personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
There is this five years - it is true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the summit of his career - the union socio-chrétienne winning 60,7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU L was the "sovereign" unique Bavaria giving 18 per cent of GDP German. 
But the conservatives are still strongly in this region of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal readjustment of the party, the vice-president and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, which initiates discussions in the dark with the liberals of FDP, as well as voters with free, trained along the right values, about a possible coalition government in Munich. 
A mockery of strange of fate was that using the list of electors free, between legislation in the Gabriele Pauli, including taking action against stroiber served as the possibility of coup carried out by the duo huber-beckstein, for then deal with the very ambitious municipal politician. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now had the ropes behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber launched a scathing remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have earned much more support from the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the Bundestag elections will be held in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor if they give up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the 2005 national success. 
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land from the CSU does not negatively affect the grand coalition in Berlin. 
Yet what is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of Democrats always hard. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - rivals: 110 - 0 
No member of the opposition has not responded to the Belarussian parliament after the elections on Sunday. 
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, that makes her prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is because illegalities committed during the counting of the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Although the Legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million opposition is going very well for many decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (odsz) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of president for the fourth time in elections, on the heels of the amendment of the Constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the odsz has abandoned its boycotting originally planned. 
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent increasingly Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political Lukashenko of Belarus as undemocratic, and several senior politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has take a credit due to the decline in imports of Russian natural gas, more expensive, and helped the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas mains across the country, fell into the hands of the Russians. 
The fact that the OSCE, the evaluation of the campaign, the emphasis on the positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of the opposition candidate, referred to a prior appeasement. 
However, the release of the OSCE on Monday already challenging the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is still a tangible improvement in the political system: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is prepared to small confrontation with Moscow, in refusing to recognise South Ossetia and the separate abazzia Georgia. However, Russia and Belarus form a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories since already a month. 
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it remains so despite that "the power was fear in this parliament, which has no weight, bringing even one opponent". 
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in light of the results. Rather, it is trying to get his message on the need for economic reform with the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this area: We need to print our newspapers opponents in Russia, the local authorities make us sticks in the wheels in terms of the broadcast, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly" - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukashenko, which considers the Social Security as its main outcome, the layer of pensioners most support is really no longer regard as appropriate. 
"Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security," referring to the silence of a cemetery ', is no longer a matter of time "- estimated Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described as the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian electorate. 
Mr Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before the work". 
Never in the history of the palace Chigi, had not revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from d ’ today, is in force this new measure against small smart, against which advanced and will then drink the coffee bar during working hours. 
The novelty anti loafers was presented today by the minister of public administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the secretary-general of the council presidency, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors tournantes- tells brunetta- are an instrument for work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services" says the minister. 
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
"It is the réformisme" in addition emphasises Brunetta. 
The installation in all the institutions of the council presidency to complete with the Chigi Palace. 
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even a symbolic point of view. 
No resistance on the part of the employees has been recorded, ensures the secretary-general: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all". 
In short, small breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests in smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7.30 in the morning is a good and healthy resolution". 
At a conference at the upper school of public administration 
In Rome, the minister communicates that "‘ in three months, the absence of disease public employees were reduced by 50%, or 60milles more workers in a year." 
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, public administration. 
Italian, "whose dynamic salariales- explains the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared by the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees have united to contest the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons. 
"While the minister of the public service today data about the decline of attendance in the workplace because maladie- wrote the Association of consommateurs- the people of" active "loafers continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the public administration correct and productive, gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, the tar, it is the exclusion of additional benefits in case of disability due to service; the extension of the permanent working arrangements, during which the individual patient visits are carried out of control, as well as other items in the new provisions advocated by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "crucial" prevention 
Every day, in Italy, there are 500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled. 
In 2007, the inail data confirm that the dead white were approximately 1 200. 
The figures which reflect the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice more deaths than the murder. 
For the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this aspect, the dramatic anmil famous today, in all provinces Italian, the 58ème national day of victims of accidents on Labour, institutionalised the second Sunday in October. 
"The data worrying broadcast by the anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the issue of Prevention in the workplace," says the president of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the National Association of anmil, mutilated and disabled, Pietro Mercandelli Labour. 
The head of state expresses its "sincere appreciation for the continued effort associative in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion" 
"Naturally outraged, everyone has struck the fist to put an end to such tragedies, which by their size, are the clamour of media and the involvement of public opinion, even if the everyday reality we present cases dramatic, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano has made no secret that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information" 
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, bear a particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people who enter the world of work. 
It is our duty, maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under assess the alarm on serious social, apply and improve the legislative norms. 
For its part, the chairman of the house Gianfranco Fini pointed out how "this phenomenon of the dead white is a social emergency absolute, who insult the conscience of all of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to make a real effort to stop them quickly." 
The data on the work appear to report a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is still impressive "stressed later the president of the anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want this" trend "cut-price result in fact, in a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention is acquittal, that is the tragedy. 
"We believe that, in general, it is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions." 
"According to nous- noted mercandelli- more checks and inspections are necessary, as an more important intervention on the training of workers, and this in school." 
It has ajouté- "we must also make an effort in the communication and the awareness of the public. 
"But we must above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers with a phenomenon which is a social Emergency." 
"Mercandelli then denounced" the progressive deterioration of conditions to safeguard the planned compensation for the victims of work 'and the' assistance drift towards which the system is moving over recent years ". 
"The aim is therefore to restore the worker the guarantee — he ajouté- so that the fate of someone who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or enlargement of the legislator" 
MP3 player finger, they put at risk the hearing. 
Ecouter music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
That was the European Commission, which, in a statement issued to Brussels, gave the opinion of the scientific committee on health risks, unforeseen and recently identified (csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This report we read in the note- scientifique- shows that 5-10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per day and a week, risk permanent loss of hearing ability." 
"I am concerned that a number also important of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage their hearing unconsciously irreparably" says Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to the data scientifiques- continues the responsible ue- it is a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public domain. 
We need to review the existing control systems in the scientific opinion, so that they can be fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people are exposed to noise that they generate. 
"The scientifiques-conclue executive ue- confirm that there are good reasons to worry and that the European Commission will examine now with the member states and other interested parties, what measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard of safety which restricts noise 100db portable music devices, but the concern is growing about the hearing damage which could lead to excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
It is possible to limit these data making use of solutions, such as the reduction of the level and duration of exposure to noise. 
The scientific committee EU noted that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force concerning the maximum of noise level agreed in the workplace. 
Those who are listening to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years. 
This interest 5-10% of users of these devices, and their numbers may be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU 
ROME, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we begin, in March we end in June we learn the sums. 
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of Rome capital ", which took place this morning, the new seat behind the spas of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the commission will develop the directives for Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the committee and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official" stamp on Capitol Hill and its mayor Mr Alemanno. 
"The Commission is totally independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are représentées- wishes to stress alemanno- it will propose ideas of development of Rome, which will serve the political decision-making, which remain the committee and the City Council. 
Any imposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner develop a major project for Rome. 
In March, it will finished its tasks and then disappear because this experience must have a specific time period. 
In juin-annonce the maire- we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission for the future of capital Rome. " 
For those who accuse the commission to be useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno reply: "It depends on the work that the commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France, thanks to the commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on his contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is being overwhelmed by the management of the newspaper and emergencies which occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and later towards a prospective deeper working seriously in the development of Rome and its future. " 
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "the Commission is not an unnecessary bureaucratic body or a whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro the urban dwellers, and will be used to study and get the best minds which express the capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, "We need a draft strategic reference or firm or immobile, to enable our city, to improve what it was absolutely necessary, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit". 
A future, which says the mayor of Rome, "will not be restricted to the usual municipal boundaries, but at further" not only in the context of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must be, as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama, the first president anti-American. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wishes to pass for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in its decisions, destroyed the USA economy and had reports (as it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the election is nearer. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition". 
Obama is really rich: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation which has just two black governors and five senators! " 
In reality, it is attacks which do not say anything; they are of course racial attacks in nature, and do not respond to the question of all voters: will it be a good President? we also surveys, which are all that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still of someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A Journal of the Mississippi, in the of the southern United States, has written an article: once in the voting booth, we know that the American Patriot will give its vote. 
That is an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end. 
"Say what you want, we see even put the cross on Obama or McCain. 
There are even people who swear to: If Obama wins, we leave the United States. 
Things never revealed until now, at this point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any event, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
We asked 1500 people: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 soldiers miles and was sent home to the fesses kicks. 
In Iraq, 500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will be a huge stain to accomplish. 
USA, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the hour deletions. And many blame the Internet, this "murders" of newsprint. 
Five hundred journalists Americans have been struck by the Pew Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not openly declared the attached information, feel less worried about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as the past. 
The problem of American journalists, that the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroying economic model. 
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are working in the Assembly newspapers, are a big problem. 
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if we want the traditional journalism as the general public will not be reduced substantially. 
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades the American journalism. 
Six in ten senior executives and journalists of newspapers printing are convinced that journalism at national level is now follow a bad way. 
Locally, the group executive is 65%. 
Printed publication against broadcast. 
The journalists are not hard to see where is the Web. 
The larger houses publishers wheedle a passage to the Internet, seen by many as the "murderer" of newsprint. 
The "economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased until 79%. 
The 500 journalists have admitted to technology hoping that she "be something good" for their journalism. 
Today, the breach of the greatest in American journalism is between who run the newsrooms- i.e the directeurs- and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that the reporters share their values, while at local level, this percentage drops to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "safety of work". 
Directors who think losing their job in the space of three years, are 47% at national level. 
As regards the journalists, we will go to 30%. 
The "work course" at the level staff (our editors, NDR) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a nation huge as the US, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it is rapidly becoming a matter of take or leave. 
Directors receive almost always big wages, while the editor can earn $10mille per month, besides retirement and the payment of insurance. 
As for the holiday, the logic is simple: X days after the first year, 10 days after the third, up to 15 days in all, past a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, journalists Americans are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
Unipol: tribunal Rome, Danilo Coppola rest has Grottaferrata. 
The president of the second section of the criminal court in Rome, Carmelo rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata for a home in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the education on the escalation unipol-bnl. 
During the trial to his burden, last week, he had obtained the release into housing in mandatory residence. 
His lawyers, Michele gentiloni and Gaetano pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go the route of the city of province to a home in the capital. 
According to the court, such movements (that the PM has not granted) would allow it to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that the blame. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon has already shown a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the American economy. 
And this is the New York Times yesterday that we confirmed that the current crisis by dividing the Republican party, more shared between their eve soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington," and the world of finance, powerful, especially in the states of Central and South. 
The soul, precisely, that has made felt so despotic with the vote which I mentioned at the beginning. 
However what has just been mentioned is but one example of the changes, the great changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or is already run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can be not just here. 
In the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena couvés for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are solidifient and are. 
The first of these phenomena is the extraordinary review, the revival of the double category etat- sovereign, compared to a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, is a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions that have obviously close relations with the world, but, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state. 
This creates an immediate political problem for which the watch: that is to say as meet the difficulties and protests to individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is global economically but politically, it is almost as national here. 
The internationalization policy seems really beyond game or well, did little to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, shared between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is to decide a common policy. 
And so, it is the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, the new rules, and especially a condition of appropriations: when going through a difficult period, there is that member states which have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use: two resources a priceless, which no market or international organisation can never have the same way. 
This new emphasis crisis of the nation-state is the rest in perfect harmony with the importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy to tend to be a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, while we were convinced to be entered in the realm of the network, technology, no more sophisticated equipment, convinced that the global finance was now intended to dominate the world, we are a blow to a single, that our future will instead address its accounts still more things with little material such as water, crops, oil. 
The things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the Earth, but which are absolutely linked to a limited area, to a territory. 
Thus, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that is not, i.e, those who had the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I now come to the second novelty however that provides a fracture. 
Who says territory, state government, inevitably said policy, and therefore political leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena convergent. 
On one side, the conscience of objective need authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who will take charge of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of disrepute leaderships for the existing economic species that have proven to be inadequate and full of grey area. 
And furthermore, something even more profound, in a sense, even worrying: a shadow, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance which tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West. 
Thus increases even more convinced of various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the word, to have the same time, and to be more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
In short, the application of leadership, feeds on underground as a powerful and ramifié délégitimassions movement of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which emerge in the "election" revolts makeshift or, in the changes of the collective mood of these latest time, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Great Britain, the US Congress rebellion against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right wing in Italy is not come by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, as if someone, have more difficulty, which is not today, to understand and therefore represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces increases, and of potentially disproportionate. 
In the view of all this talk of a current "rebellion masses" on the agenda, frankly seems excessive. 
But it said well keep our eyes wide open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Defeat the laws of gravity through a super glue, and in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman. 
That is the aim of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes is almost succeeds. 
With an adhesive made just 2.5 centimetres square, the researchers have managed to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The etude- American journal Science published discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution that we know who use a special structure carbon, called Nano carbon tubes. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have inspired the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that will ensure the animal, a perfect member. 
The tests on various materials such as glass, the Teflon, paper and glass, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that he "are easily off the wall" says Liming Dai, a researcher in the faculty of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
Walk on the walls? — "this material could be used as temporary removed" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? can be that, yes, but researchers think to use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic appliances, given that the Nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could affect the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, no super hero. 
The other area of research the University of California at Berkeley, too, was devoted to the search for a new removed. 
In a section of the American magazine American Chemical Society, researchers Californians have presented an of formed microfibres as hair, which is auto of dust during the movement in an area to ensure a complete and consistent grip. 
Medicines: never with fruit juice. 
Attention at pamplemousse juice, orange and apple. 
These drinks consumed, mainly been because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, alter the absorbement or diminishing precisely to the case, their effectiveness, with even for serious health consequences. 
David nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are in, or, if associated with the 'ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, Orange and apples, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The pamplemousse juice has been strongly criticised because held responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs anti arythmiques, antibiotics, anxiolytiques, staminales and anti neurological, up to toxic levels. 
Medicaments has risque- it is the Italian agency of the drug itself, who had given the news in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not to assess the danger arising from this mix and pay attention to what is drunk, taking drugs, such as the diazépam or the methadone. 
Not that the pamplemousse- according to the experts, even the orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
There is the long list of active principles inhibés by the pamplemousse and the other juice. 
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmaceuticals public University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international agencies of medicines to the need to change the notes informative medicines. 
Should always read the papers of medicines that it takes, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but clearly to the doctor or pharmacist "stressed the expert the agency ANSA. 
The Nobel economics to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel prize for economics has been allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade patterns and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at Princeton University, and it is also a famous columnist for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticism solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more crucial than the first, in terms of impact on the history of the United States. 
A forecast that unleashed many controversial, and was criticised for the economist for years, but who now proved to be accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, have disappeared from the public attention" said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman economist is a "high value", but also a divulgateur style "very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open office, is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft "package" 
This is the day of the spread of openoffice.org.3.0, the result open source of personal productivity which aims to reach and even more users, home to the office, professionals in public administration, proposing an alternative to free the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year, achieved by voluntary developers, monitored by Sun Microsystem, the new package open office is the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less austere, other more important, as the compatibility born to the system operational Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the final version ISO standard. 
Open office has particular attention to the interaction with the result Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
Also interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as that which will reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by e-mail or to file for import in module development chart, maintaining the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this front, it is possible to create documents "hybrid" PDF which unite the graph typical of the Adobe format the elements of a calculation map or a winemaker text. 
The cooperation between several people is an element which has had various improvements within the applications: in the calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the amendments, in the development of texts, because each employee is assigned a colour comments to a greater recognition in review phase. 
Some companies are also working to bring certain functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud on the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available addition for the operational system Linux. 
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or in the workplace. 
And if the issue of free can be a way to disseminate it in their homes, it is precisely in the business, the result is that open office the great challenge, already can count on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Without counting the realities which offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the vanguard of business. 
Open office consists of five main modules: writer, for video writing equivalent of word; Calc, is the calculation which aims to replace impress, Excel and PowerPoint presentations to the rival; dbase, such as the famous access, is the programme that can work on the databases; finally drwa is the graphic module. 
Target for 2008, reach 5 million download, and that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, it may even exceed the figure expected 
Kohl is positive, it is the fourth case of doping. 
New cases of positivité in the last round of France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best grimpeur jersey. 
It is the site of the newspaper that reported the news. 
Has 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive for EPO Cera, the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner. 
The blood tests carried out on test tubes Kohl belong to those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the positivité in Austrian Cera, will lose its third place and will have to turn to forcement expect two years of elimination. 
The news of the positivité of Kohl EPO third generation, was confirmed by the head of the French agency Anti Doping, Pierre Bordry, who provided to The Associated Press, have notified the positivité to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans was placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, raflant and the jersey to suit the best peas. 
Immigres: New York Times wondered whether Italy is racist? 
Italy "as a country of migrants has recently transformed into a preferred destination for immigrants" greeted with reluctance. 
This transformerait-il the beautiful countries in a nation of racist? that is what is intéroge the New York Times who dedicated a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, on the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defined as "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are both those where it is "more integration and more work," but also "sense anti-immigrés the height of the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord" 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature desired by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict in Quirinal, asked that the state and the church work together to overcome racism." 
Students victims rents dear, up to EUR 900 for a house. 
The market for rents for students do not no crisis 
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room can cost to a student, up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to exclude whole categories of young people, the right to the study because of very high overall costs that families of origin must soutenir- explains the head of the office of Sunia studies, Laura mariani- in these cities, strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase was amorcémême for residents. 
In most cases, the leasing offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, without limit of rent, sous-locations. 
For the Sunia extraordinary interventions through the revision of the taxation, are needed to ease prices. 
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan for a bed in the area Brianza, must be about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes 650 euros (minimum zone band nere), with an average of 800 (zone, lambiate Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of EUR 900 (zone Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a house around 700 euros. 
At Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, it is 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple house. 
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza bologna), asked about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower values (550 Euro for a simple) for the areas close of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We cannot save if it deviates in peripheral areas: 300 Euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple predestina in the area, centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, to a bed needs 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, it spends 400 to 600 euros, with prices higher in areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli aminei. 
Has Bari, to bed, it must count 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which hire are often taken by students from outside the community, there is a further anomaly: The rent asked foreign students is plus 25 / 30% compared to that applied to the Italians. 
Farewell old Cinema Paradiso, historic cities éliment historical rooms. 
The historical theatres cinemas closing for the multiplex. 
"a town without cinemas is a city blind as a face without eyes" 
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in large urban centres, Italian, but also in the cities of province 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the major multisalles, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in central areas of cities, is a major events which we believe is inevitable and more; it has all the characteristics of a true crime cultural. 
Has disappeared, the historic sites and are often responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone they know, with which we have shared a way of road and many emotions," says the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, film, which offers Tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the high price at the Cannes jurée, and the poetry of a room of province and nostalgia for a way to live film, may be lost forever. 
The figures provided by anec, the main association traders, want to say: these last five years, 316 traditional type cinemas have closed, and this is areas of major cities that have mostly paid fees: 10 under 9 to Florence, Bologna, Naples, Milan and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emily tops with 82 cinemas mono lost rooms, followed by the Tuscany (44) and the Lombardy (41). 
The evidence confirms that the first T responsibility for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because that is the three Italian regions have suffered the more new cinemas: 195 multisalles screens in addition in Lombardy these last five years, 81 in Tuscany as emilie-romagne. 
"The Italian operation has developed irrational" observed Paolo protti, president of the anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a room farm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to the multiplex. 
Not to mention the missed deliberation credit for traders: the debt of the state is approximately EUR 10 million. 
It is shameful that a étique and moral point of view ethics, the government does not respect the existing laws. 
For supporting the sector, it should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a memorandum between City Hall and anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the Mono theatres of historical centres and surrounding area. 
Among the planned normative, there are tax facilities measures in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers can enter the area to limited circulation, and will have special tariffs for parking lots and in some parks. 
"This is an initiative which I am very fond" observed Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures. 
However, it is clear that, in order to block the super power of multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is an issue which for me has always been important: the closure of the supercinema of bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me to do "new Cinema Paradiso" which I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I turn to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived to emotions shared, I turn to the other side not to see the signs by the dust. 
Links between political and “ Ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia tauro was prepared to standardize the choice of the hall to the interests of the piromalli clan." 
Heavy charges are initiated by judges in the direction of antimafia Calabria, to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia tauro, Giorgio torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external assistance for Mafia association. 
The manettes also for Gioacchino piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and her small Son of Boss, lawyer, already convicted criminals Association type, as well as to pay EUR 10 million. 
"an affront to the legal and moral prescriptive, and especially of common sense" write prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed willingness to pay consultations to master piromalli. 
"as it would have been granted to the -écrivent juges- clan to enter formally within the authorities facilitating the possibilities already considerable, control, and orientement public administration" 
The president of the regional committee calabrais agazio loiero, made no secret that "collusions between local committees and organised crime, there are more of a" in his region: "There are areas where the Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure from the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests this morning follow those last July, following which the police have announced the décapitée piromalli clan. 
At the end of April, the city council of Gioia tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and the local authorities, local politicians were relieved of their duties to administer the city. 
Giorgio Al torrione, mayor of the UDC of the dissolution, was appointed head of a coalition of centre right after the run-off in May 2006. 
He the scandal when the préfecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing to have manigancé everything for a political issue, but given the request of incarceration signed this morning, judges explained that the piromalli clan had even manages to ask the variation of the project of the A3. 
Hence interceptions ordered against Al torrione, the PM write, is tip "availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a group best known, close to the piromalli, the choice of public administration in the interests of the clan. 
When the energy is born of waves, now the big embark. 
This is a disproportionate deposit in more than 70% of the area of the planet and now the world's energy companies are starting to discover. 
Waves, currents, tides, this is the new renewable sources on which colosses as Chevron asked the eyes, and now trying to put together. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea is studied since now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in combination with the first oil crisis, the research intensified. 
When the price of oil declined to 1980, the idea to exploit marine energy was sidelined, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in the oil sector to give a huge boost 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London ruled in 2007 that 15% of the world need electricity could be covered by the operating systems of the seas. 
This amount would be double that that produce nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there would be the currents and tides.. 
Colosses to the attack. 
The first company to focus on energy Navy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, we would have said not a true revolutionary. 
Two years ago, it still more candidates among these businesses dedicated since always rely on traditional energy marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the technologies on energy océanique- the spokesperson said a fight with American oil company, the daily economic life Wall Street Journal- and she assesses the opportunities to cooperate with us." 
Cooperation in question, to deliberate obtaining a licence by the US Commission on Energy, necessary to give rise to a project of energy Navy in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that it is precisely in Alaska, the US continue to extract oil, and President Bush has recently put in place a plan for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc., New York and ocean power of New Jersey, along the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested until today, although their details are known, indicate that the observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, from the fact that the marine energy does not dispelling fears about the environmental impact. 
Currently, the systems such as those in Portugal or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use technology with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are: various ocean power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The surge of waves, which is moving the sludge to the top and bottom, is converted into a hydraulic pressure the Pistons and cylinders inside flotteurs. 
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the shore through the cables under sailors. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in phase project, in the expectation of a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used in a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six turbines under navies of the East River in New York. 
The movement of water in the tides, runs the turbine turbines, creating a movement movement which feeds a generator. 
Verdant announced have a long list of customers waiting authorisations necessary to draw energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say the Research Institute of electrical energy, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides. 
Although it is a phenomenon intermittent, the tide is more predictable wind, sun, or the vague, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, invested 7 ½ million dollars in 2008 and provides up to 35 million in 2009.
