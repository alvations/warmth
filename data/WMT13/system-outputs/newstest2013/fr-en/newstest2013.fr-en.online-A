A strategy Republican to counter the Obama re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter as a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for the Organization of elections to the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American Governments many from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon took momentum after the November 2010 elections which saw add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the single year of 2011.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo identification card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce also periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State required voters to present a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other States.
During the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens are not universal ID such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of citizens Americans, or 21 million people of voting age do not have cards with photo identification issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a piece of identity.
However, it costs often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities, and persons in low-income.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15 percent of those earning less than US $ 35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo identification card.
Much more.
Students, voters considered voting more for Democratic candidates, are not permitted in several States to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of clubs fishing or hunting who vote more Republican to side voting cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no State did require proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are citizens Americans.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two Hispanic voters in three favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have helped save about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have made 17% drop in the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the period of advance voting.
For example, in the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of voters in the State.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites, who comprised 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of the electorate voting in advance.
Of course Democrat legislators and their supporters opposed strongly the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic Governors.
The advocate general of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partly mitigate the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report by the Brennan Center's 2011 shows that States which have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 necessary for electoral college votes to win the Presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
Indeed, APS test would sometimes have inaccurate results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more already reluctant men to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We have asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, concluded that European one, a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, we have between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend the test starting at age 50, or from 40 years if there is a direct relative who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers are indolent.
To really do understand the degree of risk of cancer patient, offering him options, with not necessarily the prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life and opting instead, in these cases, for monitoring active disease.
Today, many men who detected cancer will not be processed, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest to the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
More and more, we determine with precision of the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend that still pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her physician to determine if it should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the international society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
There is unfortunately no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If more person smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This night much to the health of the people.
"Even today, it is 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", deplores the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also promotes the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity for a lifetime protects against cancer of the colon," it adds.
Food
The body also recommended to limit its consumption of red meat.
Too much, she pushed the risk of colorectal cancer.
The deli also, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of the meat by smoking, drying, or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it said.
Vitamins
Over the past years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is inconclusive however for now.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather increased.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with her physician.
"Pass a screening test, it does not cancer."
Husked Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, last summer, and for cause.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing that it.
And then, it comes to the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether it's the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that taking a new authentic particle, and predicted by the standard model Higgs boson it is resembles.
In addition, new data disclosed this week during a large physics Congress in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but the data is still lacking to be perfectly sure.
Suppose everything even whether it's well: the Higgs, the chances of being wrong seem thin, and let's see what it is.
In this world, there is a fatally unavoidable law wanting that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you are going to hurt you.
However even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns that, it has also an act of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which States that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this 'State' consisting of roughly in some of their characteristics.
Then physicists rank the particles into two categories.
In a corner, we find good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other are getting restless bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These bosons is then divided into two groups, according to the (absolutely special, incidentally) website The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley laboratories: mesons, that we discuss here, and "force", by which the great forces of nature spread and particles in which the Higgs boson would somehow related.
These bosons, it must be stressed here, aren't all of the critters as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "Messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "bothers" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a bit like a pebble in a pond.
This "disturbance" gives rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one 'carriers of force' bosons.
More stable field
It is same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "bothered" that this boson appears.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, to reach from very, very high energy, a little as if it were a pond frozen which only a very large rock could rider surface.
This is why we need a huge accelerator of particles such as CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! -to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are indeed not all particles, or all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but to other non - one piece of paper, for example, will ever itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, they are not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, like) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asked Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it is used to check the validity of the standard model (MS), and this also allows physicists to scrutinize any difference between observations and predictions of MS.
They are, moreover, several hoped fervently that found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which formed about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-oops!).
But it found no such differences at CERN until now.
Impact
The implications of this research in the daily of monsieur and madame Tout-le-Monde, they, are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is not.
Hold: did at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories, suspect not the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw in applications scientists, but nothing from the rest.
In fact, we already has fire said the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first laser continuous (the first were pulsed) in 1962 -, initially the laser was rather seen as a "gadget Lab".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not all his original intention, is now "eye" all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel in physics 2009.
Of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | The duty
With its Commission mourir dans la dignité, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly as Bill prepares.
However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.
The duty has attempted to look more closely.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer festering it had left him a respite from two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years", said, mixed, lying in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, cannot be prepared for it", he said.
The disease makes his work: a huge weakness which prevented him to go alone to the toilet, and even eat alone.
Sitting before a tasty lunch, he agrees to allow help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, it happens even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him, bring him his medication, offered him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals me diarrhea, it is humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, l 'team found a cure to this evil.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man, is it pissing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the maison Victor-Gadbois.
Regress at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments unfold at the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the House of Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer all of the cancer.
They have a maximum life of three month prognosis.
At this point, l 'team of doctors and nurses that surrounds them provides more care so-called "healing".
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I have more wishes in life", she says, before accepting that asked him a mask to help him breathe.
She waits, in the coming days, a last visit her son come to Italy.
To Victor-Gadbois, one prodigal son, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
What are the palliative care given when there is nothing else to do.
To make more comfortable death.
In Quebec, there are a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little when we know that we end all die one day.
Here, life continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the House.
Whether it's to the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
The dying, it will accept care of mouth with brandy or the Pepsi, according to request.
Diabetics will longer be required to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of the daily.
Yesterday evening, a beer was used to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"It helps the relatives as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of care.
At the maison Victor-Gadbois, days follow but not alike.
Along with an old man of 93 years that savors his last meeting of family in the Court, properly seated in his pillows while it toasts in his honor, a young man of 36 years is dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds which are occupied by of aged cancer patients under 45 years", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the maison Victor-Gadbois arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have simply not access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate suffering where a patient has reached the Terminal phase of his life, be it at home, hospital or nursing home.
And several agencies, such as the maison Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home in greater Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
It is precisely this large gap in health care Quebec which has concerned several palliative care physicians the adoption of an act governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed by luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not enough powerful to ensure that everyone will have right to quality palliative care until one accepts to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I've seen a patient go 14 days to the emergency, in great pain, without that we do need to relieve.
I am afraid that patients ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists concerned on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Survival of Hélène Richard expectations were already minimal when it abandoned a grueling chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop to beat me, she said.
However, she had told me that I "was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients seeking to die thank the caregivers of not granting their request after they were relieved of their pain with a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie me, Director of palliative care at the society of palliative care at home in greater Montréal, patients are refractory to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often then use palliative sedation, which is equivalent to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
Can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
More and more, not relieved patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you me euthanasiiez", it wants to say "I want to be relieved".
The realization of this reportage was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of large-scale in Quebec
Officials from highways, construction contractors, fundraisers for political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know of a great 'system', combining the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" which has cost dearly to Québec taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious as the system crumbles since we took drastic measures," quips Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former Chief of police of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal is broke in 2011, through a background investigation on malpractice related to contracts for road works in Quebec, to which the liberal Premier of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The 'report Duchesneau' established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he says, the only Department of transportation reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts", some scope their instincts to reach a share!
Commission Charbonneau "has already knocked two mayors", added, hoping that it gets to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A unit standing anti-corruption, created in 2011
The permanent unit anti-corruption, created in 2011, is there working also with his army of Auditors, investigators and analysts from the Government.
More "squad hammer" policemen who since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers' of Montreal to the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she conducted searches in series and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of Mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of pocketing bribes repeatedly in Exchange for public contracts.
Are formally accused of the engineers at the landfill in Montréal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
He caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the 'system' of public contracts.
3% Of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait money in Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay himself paid for years.
Mr. Zambito has sown all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then in power.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the Liberal former Deputy-Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts which it swelled costs
In Montreal, the 'system' of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former engineer in public works, has well detailed it before the Board: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $ 736,000, in Exchange for contracts of sewers which it swelled costs.
Other highways officials have admitted getting grease the bracket by inflating invoices, by false extras from 30% to 40%.
Then an organizer of the party of the Mayor, Martin Dumont, acknowledged Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately closed their eyes to a parallel budget feeding its coffers with cash sale.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women of Montreal to raise the alarm.
Mayor of the Borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the East of the island, she railed in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation which will be eventually implemented, she says she "draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and PIN the culprits".
The process, says, is "painful but positive".
We're clean the wound but should a Montréal-specific investigative unit and a vigil, not see return questionable practices.
As it is the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau noted meanwhile that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all the role of "elected aware of the scheme", when they are soaked in the scam!
Estimating 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit to $ 100 donations to parties but this will not change the situation, according to him: "as long as it will not strictly limit the election expenses, there will be money in politics."
Advocates it a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and financing of parties: "cannot go lower; "go to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the House on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh in looking in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new span with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the MTP.
Great players arrived.
Every day I progress at their side.
The technical staff has also brought me.
Every day, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I do not ignite me.
My debut in the center of pre-training of INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Étienne, I have always advanced increments.
You therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
Summer recruits are accustomed to play high level games.
They also know that each workout is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to cope and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti bring me a lot about my position.
He is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspired respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is part of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won many titles with posh clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think it will win some tracks in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then, I went out to a series of injuries.
The confidence it gives me also explains my performance.
What do you wear on the first part of season of the GMP?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the leadership position.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the champions League: we qualified for the last 16 with the way.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our word to say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our pool, to Porto, to receive during the 8th of final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
It already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG given itself the means to make this project happen.
In Ligue 1, not to win the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, it really is committed to win this title.
Last season, it is not gone far.
In may, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
It was a very big season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think that's good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think it has the weapons to win.
Do you feel that media expect too much of the GMP?
It is normal that it expected many of us view of what has been invested and the players we have.
It is accepted fully.
Later, when it won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that still found things to reproach ourselves, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
It will never win 4-0. all weekends.
It is not FC Barcelona!
We try to implement a game project.
A team is built over time.
It was proven in the champions League that could answer present.
Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the last 16, they have also made huge spending!
With regard to the sums invested, you imagined you 15 points ahead at the break!
It was neglecting our opponents and the Championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by the new GMP.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we have the smile we saying that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevail.
MTP seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better that it said there is a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
He came to it and proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
He demonstrated everywhere where it is passed that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
It also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the France team?
As a disappointment.
I had at heart to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scrounge some game time.
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Today, I get to make good games in the selection.
This is what I was hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we have to now have exemplary behaviour.
What do you wear on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results to him.
It is well-positioned in the qualifying Group for the world.
The coach is rigorous, close to players, and inspired the win.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I do want to do comparison.
White had achieved its goal in us qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to the Brazil.
The good (1-1) ripped off, on 16 October, in Spain is a founding match?
This match has given us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of monetary exchange current, based on central banks, of identified transactions and processing fees among stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a vision political is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a currency virtual (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure manner BitTorrent, Exchange Protocol that allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A little thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course of the bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $ 2, five months later, returning today around a dozen $ (courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency the most successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs other types of virtual currency as "credits", used to advance in a video game that is gained by playing or can be bought (and sometimes in return exchange).
The social network Facebook has developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuing currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses as an e-mail.
Except that a user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual-key encryption.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist both in the accounts book public, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and including the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this extra line.
It's a phase of file hash, i.e. of transformation of a large file into a thumbprint more short and unique.
Computers 'take' the new transaction and add it a number before 'chopping' the whole.
Its goal is to find the number which gives a footprint special (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes check easily that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructibly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If to defraud, a user wanted to pay two times with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer having solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the one hundred millionth, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also relieved to each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the bitcoins in deposits.
"The used fault is not the Protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium, a company's payment in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB refers also the possibilities of laundering money through this anonymous service.
But it cash also has this defect.
Actors of weight like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed accounts book and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes many in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
Bearer manages over its identity and can be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement by the merchants, who have no need to install new terminals or software.
Just them communicate an address that a phone can 'photograph and recognize', said Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for most horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is necessary, but 2013 could be a turning point," predicts.
The ECB, in its report, States to reassess the casualty, now regarded as high, in case of success of this currency.
We went to Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of his territory and Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for all of us.
These are especially the rural afghans that we have punished as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders refuge in Pakistan, but peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as of the time the Soviets often.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by the local insurgents, they will no longer when Westerners will be more discreet.
The departure of the French troops in the Nijrab base, I have observed from the top of the planted hills of almond with French funding, is made in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles have joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
There is no wave of the Taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country to fire and blood of the fact of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of the peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahidin, afghan Government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They are moulded by profiteers, seizing government lands for sale in building lots for revenue refugees from Iran and Pakistan, boasting "huge American outsourcing contracts.
They are down; most of them did indeed not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a Government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who were able to take advantage of U.S. largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They knew the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls boys.
Need to provide work to those young people who will most want to return to obscurantism former parties or corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that have a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities who will order it will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about restore provincial militias, which escape the central power.
Afghanistan, land of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State to presidential fort, abolishing the post of Prime Minister which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï wants no foreign checks, particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014.
But since the 1950s and already well before his country is dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been called into road, no dam is in condition, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, Government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise has been rumored that the Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
You have done that add to the feeling that Westerners n "were there than to seize them.
Without energy to treat the iron ore or copper on-site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by World Bank) search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
We will have to one day also the Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
New cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls of boys high school, Department of French at the University, French Institute, cooperation in the fields of military, legal, medical and agricultural, archaeological Delegation support.
"Since 2009, to"win the hearts and minds"and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, service d '"civil-military actions"of the Ministry of defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has led, and carry out a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, greedy hand-d "local workforce, could help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, trees, soil protection and increase cultivable areas."
What shall we leave as a memento, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often located more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests of small agricultural achievements emanating from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
So that they will release the insurrection led by foreign groups, that farmers have told me wish, should be maintained in their favor a little help civil, well controlled and which directly affects them.
A Constitution to the forceps in Egypt
It is a new poker president Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grant him full powers, he decided to play his hopes.
Taking everyone to court, he announced Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had granted two more months in this House to finish its work.
Soon two years ago that Egypt builds on a provisional text, several times amended which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative is that increase the divide in the country.
For his opponents, President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing "betraying his word" and "trample the law".
On the side of his supporters, we assure that it is a way to put an end to the faster with the institutional crisis and political, by accelerating the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period which forced the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he stated in an interview with the US Weekly Time.
As recourse to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: 'Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers', which supposedly ended after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly in Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing from the appeal.
Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, felt unable to enforce their views.
Representatives of the rights of man, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
Ensure that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, members alternates, have been added in a hurry, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is more often unanimously that articles have been voted.
Commentators also enjoyed themselves that one of the only differences of the day be expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the Committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent Assembly was incorrectly.
The text, which was still getting "be voted yesterday evening, has 234 articles.
Objects of all attentions the article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulates that "the principles of the Shariah are the main source of law."
Parties Salafists, for whom l ' establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" by "rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", meet the Liberals, who did see it as a coup de communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives an advisory role, in particular to verify the conformity of the laws with Sharia Al-Azhar University.
According to the specialist of the Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy".
Fears of Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next Rector of this University should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there are no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains within the vital.
"Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not scholars but academics, some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledged "there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because terms are borrowing from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" including [Islamic jurisprudence, Editor's note].
"And the question could in future be asked to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce it".
Beyond its religious aspect, the vote text yesterday is very criticized because of the powers it grants to the president of the Republic.
The brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will be not subject to Parliament, but to a national defense Council.
Nor does will be banned trials of civilians in military, as courts requested associations for the defence of human rights.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, that they consider repressive.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, of the press including.
In addition, no article is no longer echo to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was speaking yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the head of State will them, parade Saturday.
In Israel, religious places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The promised land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and a wilderness.

It is at this precise point that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers will roam the street of suffering or the way of the cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the courtroom), which is held the trial, and then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then towards that of the stone of the anointing and the Entombment.
Here lies the Christian Center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the cross was erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified was raised.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the wailing wall which is the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.

Old beliefs want that pagan gods have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country contains almost 300 museums.
Unable to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the most interesting five who are really worth a visit.

The landscapes that surround it are a surreal beauty.
It comes to perform processing based on salt water, silt, curative mud and to treat different diseases such as Dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also for just relaxing.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris linking the Egypt, the Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The town is mentioned in Greek and Egyptian ancient legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his Ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.

Jaffa you can cross some honeymooners come make sessions photo of all Israel and even other countries.
At Caesarea, city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.

Note to tourists

For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, it is primarily buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only line of metro in the country, composed of six stations and capable of linking both low and high city.

"That language has, in Moscow going": migrants save money to learn the language
While deputies and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the mandatory language test Act, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their goal: earn money to help their families remained at home.
Since 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass a review of Russian.
For the moment, this rule only affects those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and sales at retail.
However, over time, promises the federal migration Service, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it must validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of the Russia and the foundations of law.
Will have to validate your language skills in Russian to get and renew his work permit.
Exempt only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language.
People who have obtained certificates or graduates of education before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian language Institute the University of friendship of peoples, the Moscow State University, the University of State of Saint-Petersburg and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce exams was supported by members of the State Duma and the federal migration Service.
But before the Act comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly posed the question in the press: what is it going to give?
That is the obligation to know the Russian change for the Russians and immigrants?
First, meet representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many speak of defense of the rights of migrant workers, says the Director of the Office of the Russian federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized selection will solve 90% problems of foreign workers.
The problems for migrants without occupation without training, those who do not know the language and have no medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certified Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under pretext of helping him, will provide a 'journey' in a crowded little house where he and dozens of his fellow tourmenteront for months without food or paper and will work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints on the part of our migrants.
"At home, it promises them something, and when they arrive, we wrong, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected salary," confirms the CEO of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue me, Mr policeman!
However, many nationals from the Central Asian Republics wishing to come make money in Russia entrust that they know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow do - what would be a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families have not even enough to feed their children without talking to dress them properly and to equip them for the school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave earning money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's difficult when we do not know the language, they entrust.
"You feel diminished and diminished".
The human rights defenders however notice an important aspect of the language Act.
Examinations will be intended only for migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there is not a review or official work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Défense d'entrer"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, can obtain a false registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know we have false documents, we have no registration, where cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea", told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan.
"Do quickly, does not skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was discovered that migrants registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the federal migration service.
The falsified papers emerging from a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had them for nothing: each migrant who hoped thereby to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the three migrant worker thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights advocates agree that the short term objective is to protect the system against corruption to make it impossible to just buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities may give migrant workers who were unable to validate first review time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively contact people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not the market of weapons dealing
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against holders of civil firearms.
Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether shots performed at weddings or the slaughter organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police wants to ban the wearing of rubber bullets weapons in public places and raise the legal age to obtain a permit to carry a gun by passing from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Firearms Act would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Everybody is unhappy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter has appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives from various centres of fire, require to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said to the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a six month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are some that the strengthening of the laws concerning civil firearms will not prevent criminals from obtaining supplies on the black market.
According to them, can be found today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market of weapons provides via multiple channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired Army colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking orders of weapons
The first is "military route", i.e. weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians", explains Baranets.
The second type of from the black market weapons are stolen by criminals to the police.
Baranets said that it is also of stolen weapons in stocks of the police as stolen directly to representatives of the forces of order.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Documented versions indicate that some fires were sparked deliberately to hide the deficit", says the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see plants of private weapons which do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is contraband.
An important part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local, sometimes small-scale production, a mafia was formed and organizes the supply," added the former military.
Where do arms come from?
The experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was in 2011 by the Centre of analysis of the problems and study for public administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data of the weapons-related portals.
The vast majority of the weapons illegal, the researchers explain, comes from the army and the security forces.
Half of these weapons on the black market ended 'by fault of employees whose work is linked to arms", explains in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from "illegal excavations".
A salesperson and consultant of a Gunsmithing who requested anonymity ensures that since long person buys weapons found by these specialists of the illegal search. they are too old.
More often, according to him, sellers will seek new cargo in military warehouses.
The person buys through an ensign of a unit, for example a TT pistol.
On him pound passing through a mesh screen.
"It carries the city and sold it for €900 per unit with two Chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police is aware of all business, so, when crimes are about to be clarified, she makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," adds vendor.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are generally through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type manifests and propose to come at Begovaya station where someone was getting take me in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun on gave me it on-site
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, should I know someone who has a contact, says vendor. I know someone, but I do trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you must come also by saying for example "on the part of such person, who has asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I buy even a pair of knuckle dusters with a person who I trust.
It book me to me only because he knows that I will not give it.
The small new looking weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal in the mid-1990s weapons when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
Diagrams, according to him, have not changed.
One gave him a photo album in which he had "everything to be".
"I thought I was in a luxury boutique", remembers the military.
There's no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, it goes with the seller in the forest, and installing a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we begin to negotiate," describes the expert.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different purposes".
To do this, there is need of any document and person to meet.
"Just to have a specific sum of money", is written in advertising on the site "Buy a pistol or a submachine gun for combat".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And it sells to minors?
"Without permits, of course", "Ivan" (spelling retained) user request.
"Buy TT. Moscow, wrote "Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and picks up the shovel people wanting to buy combat arms.
People are flocking to the food as hungry wolves and then they find themselves to operate coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I've heard of this type of diagrams: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the laws of Russia.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"It receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explained the Secretary of the association 'Right to a weapon', Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets said that by making an application on the site, one can find themselves unarmed and behind bars.
The federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and picks up the shovel people wanting to buy combat arms.
"People are flocking to the food as hungry wolves and then they find themselves to operate coal in Siberia", - he says.

The purchase of an illegal firearm, believe the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association 'Right to a weapon', you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
He came out of long storage time by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official Ministry data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased overall in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while proven cases of robbery and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs dropped by 7.8%.
United States: employees of fast-food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a work of cashier at McDonald's
These days, a wave of protests is mounted against the low salaries by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will grow or falter quickly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of associations from left.
In addition to the salary increase modest perceive employees based at Walmart and fastfood chains, the organizers of the demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions.
This area is for now not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving on "Black Friday", at the time where a surging rain of balances seizing million inhabitants befell America and sometimes triggering of outbursts.
That day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their positions to arrange picketing with unions and activists of left in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything: layers to shotguns from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in larger supermarkets.
This is why many poorly paid at Walmart employees make their races only at their workplace.
The price and the choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products because of the low wages of its employees.
They complain also difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the manifestations of the "Black Friday" demanded a wage increase, they have complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the base at Walmart employee who receives $ 9.5 per hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average wage to $ 12 per hour, this would cost the Group $ 3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all of the increase of wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store they would be 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now.
Proponents of Walmart noticed with satisfaction that protests were held in only nine States and did no harm to the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores by 8: 00 the night at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 items per second.
Its caisses conducted in all 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
The company spokesman Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left site Huffington Post that in any "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was a "com operation' among many others" on the part of the organizing Union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and no longer concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet settled) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces sale of billions of servings and after they don't even give you no sick leave and do you not pay the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the municipal Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal law and New York is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase them over time, but little, on average its base employees receive in New York $8.90 an hour.
No touch less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time where nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, the forum of the Wall Street journal found on comments saying that it is irresponsible to children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who have launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue required that cashiers and fast food cooks are paid at least $ 15 per hour, is increased over two times that the current minimum wage.
They also asked that unions are created in the fast food sector.
American law prohibits the administration to impede and punish the protesters of a Union by bullying or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their life.
For a Union to seize fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary staff rotation.
They are not agree
Other tumultuous events stood near several other fast food chains.
The moment the protest flagship was the rally at midday near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several democratic local politicians, including Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces sale of billions of servings and after they don't even give you no sick leave and do you not pay the work you've done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats in sight, including by the candidate to the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food employees so that they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized this as the most important event that has known fast food sector in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people attended besides that all were not fast-food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say if this spark of mass movement will be small.
"For the moment, it happens that moderately to fool the brain"
Recently, new technologies fans have become accustomed to perceiving reality augmented through special glasses.
Initially, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the application for the patent.
However, it is the interview with the Director of the Group of interactive 3D technologies of laboratory Microsoft in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands by creating virtual spaces open.
-Could you tell us in a few words what does your research group?
-We are working on the interaction between man and the machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained for the moment to pixels on flat-screen and sometimes the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
-That also the future holds?
-Although the Kinect made the physical interaction, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of the information has been improved (the system gets more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We try to change it and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D running on different technologies, including technologies of projection.
Need to get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
This, however, to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a more convenient form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
-What do you think of the voice command?
She is popular, but is it not overpriced?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because it did not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to discrete, small gestures.
The gestures were not caught by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
Currently, it is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + votes.
-That is to say?
-For example, how me you ask you pass this bobbin?
You would with speech and gestures.
-Usually, I speak only.
-Oh, it'll be difficult to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or not do at any given time?
-Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us better to identify the reactions of human.
Can be for example of laser sensors, they produce a pretty good depth resolution and this is very important.
-If there is interest in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, that you dislike in modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else yet?
-In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.
It would obviously get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixel themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are good enough, this adds work to designers of algorithms.
Keep in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also much, regardless of the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not sufficient, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond gave to the touch of the sensors a regular backlog of between 1 and 100 µs, current sensors being nearer the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I have need of a device of this type in my work, but do not require touch, to have more frames per second.
-Should but we not increase the number of cameras?
-The Kinect has now three 'cameras', which is in fact an infrared emitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual sensor in the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse it by increasing the volume of calculations required.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras to see how it could help to define locations.
-As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not his glasses to the public.
Do you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with more prospects?
-Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands is not practical but here is what I think: the best option is a 'transitional' augmented reality that you would from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The goggles are a very personal device and that is that is their strength (personal items are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality augmented from the glasses you will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with others.
-Imagine that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is more accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there's no tactile sensation!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepares compared to this challenge?
-In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of second hand for support of image.
It saves perfectly pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign the palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several rays ultrasound directed towards a precise point where the finger and gives you the sensation for the still weak moment, a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work opportunities.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Him to believe that he feels what it should normally feel when he sees something?
-This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a spot underneath on which need a long time to give trouble: how to believe in someone who is physically located in a space very reduced walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs)mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, you do not achieve that moderately tricking the brain, there are yet many years of work.
This is what makes working on VR so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute State of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This selective list has already hosted prominent actors of the art scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known in all Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, all wearing red that can be crossed close to the Russian Museum, the garden of summer or holidays and plugged openings.
Kirill Miller tables always gather crowds, regardless of their place of exhibition.
It is fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the avant-garde Petersburg by the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes smile people and puts them in a good mood.
He took recently in his hands a barrel organ and it has become the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role due to its existence, its philosophy and its Bohemian image.
-Kirill, why is that you route the city while red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
-I chose red as fashion designer specializing in the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image creator and the company.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey is aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to initiate the discussion.
The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when you understood that you had to be a painter?
-The exposure of the Palace of culture Nevskiy whereabouts of my work.
I understood that it was my way.
Then, the wave of old informal painters was passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I started to tie my friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10", and then there was more vague.
I am interested in the theatre, fashion, music, all genres except the words.
- And all this is found in your artistic clinic... - it was important for me to be in the center of Saint-Petersburg culture where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took took place at Pouchkinskaya-10 which housed prior to construction a club musical and artistic, Bohemian club, home of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born: the name, Tequila-jazz, I see again Chnour happen with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in tight-fitting football shirts, they employed among them Igor Vdovin, composer today fashion.
When the Group began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg led a lot of emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We have given them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that they were received.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboedov": these are repercussions of the art clinic.
Our employees are gone as regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, at the time where culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was appointed "Painter of the year", and it was then that my reign has ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with ancient rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
-Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
-Many of my paintings are hits, they possess a relevant and very high acuity.
I'll have a programmed exhibition 'The Russian Museum through the clowns'.
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was someone's social, today it hurts and it's scary to be so.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragic fall.
I like the grotesque, I grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of save the world via disguise total and compulsory.
Today, it is the habit that matters, there is interest in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Perhaps may not give him the hand, but to rather him spit in the face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
-Recently we saw you in the role of the barrel organ player. -A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else I can play it.
-But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
-Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, sweet.
Disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, people were divided in herds, proponents of the Bohemian liked something, the silly another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, we must think who you gonna please.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
-These are the people that it has thrown coming to see it, it is the sexual side and social walking.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and ultimately it is less management, money, just wasting away.
I have my fans, the main do not deceive, to not spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector has hung next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are those that are painted at the end of life.
Today, it is often confused ideas.
It said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption is not culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
-Kirill, what missing in St. Petersburg?
-Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official culture.
But not everyone can work in the culture.
During the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars did not well understand culture, but they understood the need to keep good experts.
In Moscow, there are today good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg that may be experts, but are separated because need higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and will pave them a path.
Currently, it is the "taste" that flowers.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they take any contemporary art there are painters who must be other museums.
-For you, what is it St. Petersburg?
-Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there are many Moscow more culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
To us, this layer is very thin.
We make art to fashion as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project realized with the support of the Saint Petersburg stock exchange
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings aboard go looking for a planet of relief.
To save humanity, a big question arises: How can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I believe what he did is not much choice.
There are in fact two real planets which can be conquered, not by assumption.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live in very high altitude or orbit of Venus... in space.
Began to look at issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Yet half a century ago it was conducting experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit is differentiated in any way from Earth varieties.
Then, have been in orbit of insects, small breeding Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness.
It gets out a normal chick.
It is then the problems begin.
The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find support, it must stand on its hind legs and start moving, explains the Director of the laboratory of the Institute of biological problems of the Academy of sciences of Russia (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
In finding no support, the chicks flapping in a disordered way.
And after 10 hours, the new born saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks responded to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We have goggled eyes twice, then we dropped, because it is simply impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last "Ark miniature" biological with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" embark that species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, it has discovered nothing supernatural.
"It was still the biosatellites and then it is only experience. Required this type of research, notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it cannot yet make reproductions directly in space.
This is not an easy matter.
In losing their usual environment, animals are more able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike the animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create a proper emotional background.
This type of experiment is not done for ethical reasons.
But women are in space for the past 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity has more precious.
Our Gull flew and no one on earth could say if it would after a flight in space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retirement of the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after its flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have little, very little of cosmonauts who had nothing and giving birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit", concludes the pilot and Cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection from radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Laboratory of hydrology of the cosmonauts preparation Center: mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in buoyancy, the cosmonauts train exits extra-vehicular.
The water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but however a foreign environment for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on earth comes from the ocean.
Insofar as the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb of his mother, it is easier to get then used to water.
It's basically logical, because from its birth to its first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget", explains the swimming instructor to infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a Word, if for the child who has been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman has to gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, basin wither very quickly, the ability to boost the baby is lost.
Okay okay, ignore it relying on simulators of childbirth.
We can of course prepare a birth in a Special Chamber, women will come to get him out.
'And then?' application Valeriy Polyakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
Other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If he feels no gravity, the body does not form a skeletal and muscular system.
It is impossible to dress an infant as an adult with a special suit for workouts.
It will be simply deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely overdoing", provides for the Director of the Committee on bioethics of the Institute of biological problems of the Academy of sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, over time this will become reality, when earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the Sai (Supreme Audit of public finances Institution) said: "the control of self-employment nickname (in Czech"system Švarc") failed because politicians."
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and good legislation but it is lagging behind with respect to its application.
It was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application should be just and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in our", said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A control run jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice 'Švarc system' approach by Petr Nečas.
Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with controls contractors; is it permitted or forbidden?
"Law should well be applied one way or another then if it prohibits something, even the leader of the Government cannot prevent an investigating authority to inspect to demand respect for the law," said Kala.
At the meeting of the commission of control to the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project under which legislation on procurement of these two countries were compared.
What was it specifically?
It is a control parallel that we started this about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation how manage procurement and specific national laws as well as actual practice him make suite.
We've put together this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences appeared: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "stronger and better", however, based on some parameters, as such practice is better in Germany.
This confirms therefore that it is not enough to continually develop more detailed rules, but it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the right.
What this project can help you practice and what follows it for you?
Common control of this type should precisely contribute to what we stopped to try to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, when there is a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means get the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, it will not necessarily reach this goal.
It could be that this system is is so overwhelmed by the paperwork, that those seeking flaws will find many more opportunities than if the threshold remained highest.
You talk about internal problems concerning the practical implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there an analogous to our ISC or a different mode of organization institution?
With regard to institutions, similarly to the ISC, there works the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized Similarly, there is also a somewhat differently constituted Board, but these two institutions are fundamentally similar.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a shade however compared to our system: the Germany being a federal structure, it therefore also has the courts of Auditors of this type at the level of the individual Länder.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds here to the resources of the State.
Public funds to us by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled level of courts of Auditors of the Länder.
With regard to national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I would not make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, the Germany is often referred to as a model, but one surely cannot say that it is better in all areas.
It may be due to the fact that they have best inspectors?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it is also true that this country that we consider a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no benefit to cooperate with our institution, non?
In relation to national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the Act on public procurement, its effects are already being felt?
This amendment had entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet impact on our operations control.
As we do a posteriori controls, it is with some delay.
Our observations relate only, for the moment, the process for the preparation of future controls - we have launched a new 'detect the risks of poor management' instrument with which we had to sift through nearly 14,000 procurement - where these changes will be of course felt, because the thresholds have changed and the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
What so you consider the adoption of this act instead as an advantage or an increased workload for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
The problem that can occur is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to abide by them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (for example the regional Council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on procurement means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the tougher Act in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system should exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those committing formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
What is the solution to get by?
Let's look at where we do not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not annoy entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called Švarc system - what is this mean?
The Švarc system is prohibited or permitted?
The law should well be applied one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the leader of the Government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.
He may declare: "We will change the law and allow it", but he can say that we are going to act as if nothing happened.
The procurement law consists of relatively strict on the formalities and rules, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only due to formal defects.
The law is never perfect, but its application should be just and is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen places, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
The network remains largely feasible, in places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were this morning passable, but by jellies and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between-5 ° to - 10 ° C but they should slightly back in the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the region and it remains in the Plains that a thin layer of snow.
The peaks of the Ore mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered about 30 cm of snow.
According to information of the regional service of road maintenance due to the fog, visibility was reduced places.
Expressway R6 and the national roads in the area are now passable without difficulties.
Vigilance remains to be set, for example on some bridges including the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All secondary roads and pathways of third category, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still on some of their sections of the remains of frozen snow and patchy packed with traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Directorate of roads and highways reported on its Web site that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers compacted by the traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and located areas in altitude.
Maintenance of roads warned drivers against the risk of formation of ice in areas of the region of Pardubice located aloft.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička and Svitavy and Vysoke Myto, and this primarily on departmental roads and third category.
I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy roads have been treated chemically.
Snow occurs primarily in the giant (Krkonoše) mountains and the mountains of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, snow packed by traffic is present on roads in areas located in altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the time will be today dry, mostly cleared, with any cloudy.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally vary between-3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen region
Pilsen region roads are now passable, although in places, should be to exercise increased vigilance and adapt his conduct to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range from-3 ° to - 6 ° C.
After the recent snowfall and the cooling that followed, some channels of communication may be frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility improves, however, gradually.
This is reflected in the regional service of road maintenance information.
Highway D5 is almost without difficulty, however, maintenance of road communications services recommends vigilance increased between 80 km and 131.
Most roads are dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in Plzeň-South district and in the Tachov district.
Departmental and third category pathways are moist and in this case applies in warning against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, and it especially on less-travelled roads in the Šumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Travelling to areas of the region of Olomouc aloft conductors today count with a layer of thick and soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the said pass "Červenohorske sedlo" and on the road in the direction of Videlsky kříž, after chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced this night maintenance personnel of the roads to travel on the ground; According to the services in charge of highways, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulties.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk are remains of snow.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet the said pass "Červenohorske sedlo" snow layer thick and soft "said today in ČTK the head of maintenance of roads in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in Jeseník district also went on the spot during the night; According to these, after the performed chemical treatment, roads, are now identified and wet, even in the highest areas.
In Olomouc district roads are passable with difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in the sections in wet forest areas remained pavements.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
As of this morning, Northern Bohemia road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to information of the police, that in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain ranging from Telnice in Knínice na road Ustecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in most low altitude, and therefore the snow and sleet expected to be maintained on the roads. In the Plains, particularly to the South is the Plateau central Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are mostly dry.
No traffic difficulties were reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štěti.
According to meteorologists, the nocturnal conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting of snow during the day, skies and freezing during the night.
It also pointed out, since the main roads, difficult conditions on national route 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which are are bent under the weight of the snow until it reaches the floor.
Šimon Ornest said: "Together, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh instead and say that we are the only group able to collect remnant of positive energy to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, you climb in December a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce more detail this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we are preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Mayan calendar scheduled for December 21 at 11: 10 am in the morning.
Eve, on 20 December, three concerts will take place at the same time, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They end almost at the time which will end the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, located in the Pacific ocean, on a time zone ahead 12 hours compared with us.
Who had this idea?
Initially i think it was my idea, then we all designed with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we want to also together with the public, reflect on the State of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "end of the world canceled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, hear at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we are successful and that the end of the world has no place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in three concerts.
Hymns will also join at any time as part of a program live, quite unique, the Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanak which also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings also...
How you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz figures, partly because we organise many concerts and charity events...
We strive to engage intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the context of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit with students of the Institute Jedličkův and offer activities that interest them and entertain them.
The students themselves do not have the means to attend courses, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project in a new independent building.
Several groups of music and performers will rise on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria have you the chosen?
We have tried to develop a program aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will rise on stage Chinaski, Support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Get ready also to other "mega-events" of this kind in the future?
In may, we will be playing for the first time in the context of the Prague Spring; Here too, we will surely prepare a program of quality with interesting guests.
We would like to also play next year in the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on place in the United States, I'd combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you've played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group composed of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the Organization and logistics of your tours?
It is not so terrible that it looked at first.
We have five members in electric wheelchair which vehicles must travel in the hold, naturally we also trimbalons many luggage and boxes of instruments...
So far everything went more or less always well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went without problems.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ with regard to facilities of access for persons with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that East all is still in an initial phase.
From Prague, Moscow is still very accessible to people with disabilities; There, it is still common that a person moves only electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider a no-brainer to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there also, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being established.
What should we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still late...
It is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements always depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the Museum, anywhere...
This is still not very common there that a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary to the State of the art!
The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians and famous lawyers.
For the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, back back a few years, what is it that you pushed in 1998 to create this group?
I started to work as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young loans to invest in something.
And as myself musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, with time, as says our Láďa Angelovič moderator, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
The success came only in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, the fact to create links with well-known singers and work actively to the promotion of the Group helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to grants from the European Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so forth.
Had for objective to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of stuff that will copy each other.
Somehow, it makes sense: all that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts long.
Rare are the original drafts, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally the pity, it is natural...
But the pity is totally useless, because people with a disability are not human beings suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities can achieve something, is not only a breakthrough for them and for society as a whole.
Your success is also due to the fact you are a demanding leader, as you qualify by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think that is quite normal.
Some people arrive here with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice weekly, follow preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they rapidly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How much d ' between them were already there in 1998?
One, Lenin Angelovič.
We are an open Group, people come and go, one can nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
It will be the case on the eve of the day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 pm.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians of Czech Republic.
Late in the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when will be jointly sung the song by the band The Tap Tap "End of the world canceled".
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources (to the tune of 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket for this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.
The Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, the Poland was admitted as a 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008).
The Poland had initiated close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the ensuing years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
The road to Poland to the space however began much earlier.
Already before the second world war, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not meet always of understanding.
I would like to mention for example the conference of a. Šternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw, December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his pioneering book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) let cold listeners and years later Šternfeld remembered that only the doctor Jan Gadomski became interested in its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Said doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and Astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned Astronautics, its contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
As early as 1925 was built in Poland railway intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Known unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear either if the rocket was intended to propel or slow down the motor.
The only information known about this motor are those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets.
The searches were conducted by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
According to preserved documents that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research itself are interrupted.
In 1937, a rocket of photoelectric hunting plans, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "ISI - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" with a copyright referred to as Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using the technique of the rockets were led by the interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated all the work.
This Committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) company.
For the first time, it is question of a society in the issue of November 1954 of the newspaper problem, in which are four more detailed articles dedicated to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to space travel
At this time, artificial satellites projects had already been launched, and it was clear that the field of space research was the future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical (PTA) company deployed efforts to enter the (established in 1951) International Astronautical federation and by the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical federation.
He retained his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the development success of the meteorological rocket RM (Stanley Meteorologiczna), who became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1,800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently built an improved version, RM - 1A and summer 1959, tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket flight were initiated in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 m long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform practical scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind aloft.
But in 1963, all development work were stopped.
The rocket Meteor-1 focusing the period of 1962-1965, succeeded the first rocket of type RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor - 1,-1B and - 1 c) were developed. they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space for scientific tools.
The Meteor rocket - 1 has had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor - 1 B this volume was 0.34-litre and Meteor-1 c of 0.62 per litre.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 miles.
In the period 1965-1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aviation Institute, the first flight trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload to an altitude of about 60 miles.
Subsequently were built the Meteor - 2 and Meteor-3 versions.
Still, it is worth mentioning the entrance of the Poland COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
Under the program Interkosmos, the Poland has also participated in space exploration on the Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the driver Miroslaw Hermaszewski, became Vladimír Remek, second non-sovietique Cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on works of public utility.
This decision has raised in public opinion a lively discussion.
It is no doubt interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic competition unregulated.
This means that the various economic entities as well as national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This follows from the principle of freedom of trade and the free (no limits) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
Considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate tension on prices.
Should be under this term the following meaning: a producer tries by the importation of goods sold at lower taken to resist economic competition "making more expensive" price of the competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either move production abroad, buy cheap, disappear. The result is unemployment in countries where labor costs are high compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thereby even responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment it creates, the State payroll increase necessarily.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate as well economic and social damage to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This is to the point of public notoriety that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.
Private capital unscrupulous practices result in different economies a situation in which the Governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, Governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.
This occurs primarily in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of the employees in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, growing poverty and the deepening of differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, there are decades of points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There already by millions the number of these people.
In the context of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common that employees receive for such wages that the State is forced to pay extra so that they reach the subsistence level.
Such a scandal has for example been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal Parliament.
Savings measures of virtually all the EU's southern Member States generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the company, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), either of eke with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital to invest in their country.
It is here the question: where will the capital come from?
If it comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty will go from one country to another; This capital may not come no more, or so a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This concerns also throughout Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, is tired, that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It must then ask if private capital does not influence and, similarly, directs not today, according to its own selfish interests, policy and thereby the entire State.
The answer to this question is definitely Yes.
The evidence is that there is a lobby virtually all-powerful and present in all States.
The result is a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such, that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All of the power does not come from the people, as stated in the constitutions of Western type, but of powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "the State was long full failed and functions were attributed by the violence.
Bribes, illegally, obtained favors kicks and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The Kickback and bribery proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with pre-sold voices"...... "Honest people were not seeking to get functions, this resulted in once the State stayed 8 months without consuls"... "' Really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and needed to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind pumped, but this is Caesar who has transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on preference for personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to advance the interests of society as a whole.
Result, now as formerly, decadence without preceding elites, with no effort to perform in-depth reforms.
We must seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and Communist regimes in liberalisation without scruples of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, one can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of the democracies of liberal type as a kind of pause before a new step.
The fact that the current elites ignore completely the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, humanitarian and social crises which we are now witnesses and crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level than at the European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
Indeed, this trend is systemic.
The solution consists of reforms with socio-political aims, which will strengthen the State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and can never" declares Sting in the Fragile entitled song for which the main verse of the chorus is "Let's not forget how we are fragile".
"If my son wanted no wars, no there are not", said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions amounted.
Some take the party of Israel, citing its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in her waves of recurrent killings; In sum, the current residents of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a viewpoint located 'behind the curtain', on which benefit primarily the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of, or more exactly the Group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the story of a fight for power.
Each time, we find an Alexandre the great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is to know if these individuals acted independently or if they were accountable to the throne someone who ran their acts on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time where the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration causing some powers could not be done in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the Octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
By the 90s of the 19th century, they acquired the first World News Agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them strengthening their power, an increase of their fortune, or both.
They own major stakes in almost most of the central banks of the world and prepare or lead wars against countries where they do not have such entries (prior to the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi from 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank controlled by the Russian Government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Central Bank to Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue its own money during the civil war (Government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden had been poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to file a lawsuit against the FED to have triggered the economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level has led in the years 1859 to 1871 in the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated into the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was designed to eliminate the large State monarchies of Europe, the second was to remove particular British colonialism and the third is expected to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing else than the beginnings of such a solution) and, in the endacquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of wealthy families with their head the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the chaos order).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid that are not repeated crises like those they provoked in 1907).
After having succeeded in the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German surrender without justification economic and military (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power in Central Europe.
For more easy triggering of the second world war, bankers have left politicians create a latent conflict situation: they have, on the one hand, imposed on the Germany's enormous war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (just them then place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing to the culprits, offering simple solutions) andon the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which was to play the role (she ran actually) of fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, which one of the branches aspira at the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed to another.
World War II broke out; It is difficult to assess if Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had held him initially; or if all it did was planned, the fact is however that the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundations for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way war reparations imposed on the Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a seat of fire that could provoke a third world war.
If the international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the second world war, the first victim fights, this time as well as Arabic or generally Muslim Middle East population.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong causes other harm as a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the world?
It must here make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their rulers, because as we, the international bankers offer people to elections than their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist politician loyal vis-à-vis international bankers, who did everything to trigger a war with the Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Organization of Shanghai cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) spread to become a global conflict, and given that the Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which passes 20% of all global oil (naval corridor has a width that's) 2 miles) and result in a destruction of the world economy.
Under which light now appear with David Rockefeller said in 1994: "the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new born was implanted at birth an electronic chip making it an be totally controlled.
"They forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to marked on the hand or forehead with a red iron, so that he can neither buy nor sell one that does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name."
It must be understood: that good sense has the digits of this fierce beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The Argo movie: when all goes as wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students took stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in Exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not provide the US administration of positive outcome, she could not, in effect, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, still later compounded by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
Kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed strongly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, actor and Director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just until it is occupied, six staff escaped from the Embassy.
After complicated vicissitudes, they found their way into the residence of the Ambassador of the Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to out of Iran through incredible coverage: they left the country with Canadians in both passports that a coming shooting team members make the locations for the filming of a film extravaganza of science fiction.
Combination of genres
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez plan required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make more credible legend, of magazines specialized did state this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", a successful story, a treachery - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
Atmospheres follow one another: Tehran's documentary-style sequence (in the captioned sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, through these pictures, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there is no large differences),
passages more lightweight Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to restart his career in a remarkable way.
Ridiculed actor, he has become a respected Director and his actor play ceased to create ironic remarks.
ARGO is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film of Affleck that does not take place in his home town, Boston.
The meaning of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films over Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is required" by the Canada.
The movie's best scenes unfold in streets, during the reconstruction of facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the Embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, written a page of history.
Affleck and his staff get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the wrong crew in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too many shares in too many places
The Director had to settle a subject offering in fact only few exciting scenes in the film sense of the term.
It comes out well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis in Tehran airport is barred by a phone in America call and the pursuit on the airstrip are enough drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo is dispelled, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters deserved greater attention and it is not, far from it, only in this case.
Affleck film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it can be see with moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It leads the Viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history yet, somehow unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he made the case.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Now, the www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which leads every year a public inquiry into the most absurd fees, decided to launch the competition regulation or the ideas from "the EU workshop" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU is considering, these last time, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision," said the newspaper Pravo the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the above nonsense, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women were favoured with regard to life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the workshop of the EU".
"The vote will take place before the end of the month of February, 2013", informed Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components in fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size of the cages for hens, which resulted in the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics were also issued in the past against the prohibition of using the expression "butter spreads" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes requirements of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, originally because in the Union, bananas should not be less than 14 cm in size or submit an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that she was to harmonise non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives lead to a waste of food.
The first prize will be may be awarded to this investigation in the EU regulation of last year that must appear on the balloons a warning indicating that children less than 8 years should not inflate without supervision of an adult.
The EU refers to an American investigation that the balloons are among the toys, the first cause of death of children by smothering.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years when it comes to blow trumpets of fair.
Here too, we have bizarre ideas.
The following rule concerning officials Europeans themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for the Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name 'Macedonia' and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let do" gathering of liberal economists, the Bankovnipoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the rules of the Union regarding the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked, as such, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea to pay sums of money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not originating from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact of not having sea disabled us.
We will ask the European Union a refund". Thus expressed himself, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following so-called "interventionists" purchases, the State was found with solid stocks that it had to then export.
Palas, the EU should pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic away from the ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants grants have been proposed in the House of Commons by the Ministry of local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US - DEU), in practical terms, they should be used to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.
The EU said: "the bizarre rules are rare".
If the regulations often arouse criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU regulation and improvement of the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development, rather deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight which she released not always winner) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the name "rum Tuzemský" dating back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products sugar cane alcohol based, and not made from beet sugar, can wear the name of rum.
In the official list of products registered EU, found today in the company of cheeses world-famous as the Feta or Gorgonzola, Marzipan from Lübeck or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary") cookies, carp Pohořelice and Třeboň ("a Pohořelický kapr publication") and Žatec ("Žatecky chmel") hops.
Pardubice gingerbread ("Pardubicky pernik") and cakes called "Cones of Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.
People want that I save the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, said Senator Okamura
How was Mr Senator, the idea to stand in the presidential elections?
This is not to be Senator or president that counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would be nowhere candidate.
But I can't stand anymore seeing as the country was plundered during these past two decades, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the retirement age increase.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something which does me not like, so I try to bring a solution to make it change.
And as I have more than forty years and I am independent, Member of any party, I have no alternative to influence the situation to introduce me to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You came to the Senate but you are quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
You do not turn back to who you were elected?
I've always said that I shall conclude me in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections
Subsequently, I told them that if I was elected Senator, I would me to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
This is why I need the greatest influence and the broader mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we piétinons cough those trying to bring change.
Added to this is the press breaks the reputation of people who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
On, for example, said in my remarks I bribed journalists or that I was the Adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
We come to your visions.
You have started the fight for the castle with workhorse as the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
You must to this end change the law.
As president, you don't have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I have pressure to ensure that the activities of tourist guide constitute a profession, I got successful.
The problem is the politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, Member of any party, I have much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, take each party what's best for our country and implement it.
You consider yourself as a human right or left?
A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather to the left.
For me, be it a little to the left or right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we are going forward.
What counts for me, it is not that people are left or right but bringing people together.
I support still any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act as impartially against bad ideas.
What is wasting you when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said does it prove?
When developing a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You try to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about.
But without the support of the Parliament, it remains as slogans.
You will not long survive in politics with that.
Do you think that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose physical and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then, they should eventually explain why they do not want.
When there is a strong personality who identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, unequivocally, be an amateur and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I just involved me in politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try only to advance things, and if it doesn't work, I will stop in six years, and I go back in the private sector.
It is a little as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a Savior.
I know that one person can not make a difference, this is why I went to see a number of personalities asking them to also attend the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have the least-supported Jana Lorencova investigative reporter who revealed the oil fraud.
I came because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people have not voted and what have done so, for the most part, gave their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two independent.
People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes.
Despite everything, I vainly fire to my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I in did not the financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I did that twenty thousand on my 'transparent' account.
You have no money?
You are talking about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimated about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a field of 25 million, an apartment with a value of ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art with a value of about 10 million, an Aston Martin, which is worth 3.5 million and a Superb with a value of 1 million Škoda and a few million on my account.
Either way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always loved James Bond, who was traveling by car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You ride in Aston Martin, you have a heritage of 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for this campaign.
I should into debt me?
I've already invested 2 million and half in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program does not raise great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by compensation will I receive as a Senator.
But I could not live, for example paying the English School of my son that costs $ 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I do myself in any elections.
So, you will continue your commercial activities to be able to live?
Had you not stated that you would put your activities muted?
But this is not related to the amount of that compensation.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take spring branch of the travel agency.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
However, it need while I live something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I earned and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd put end to my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday editions of the journal Prava.
The firm MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just matter of imagination. To be convinced, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly-books - 2 photos
"I find that this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a bandwidth on the shoulder of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company nearby, tells us: "Yes, it is actually very well, this building".
But I wonder why we still need today a library.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, more no one will voluntarily in one of these libraries lame, no?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom community that has nothing appealing on the outskirts of Rotterdam, holds a peculiar record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the rate of the lowest education of the Netherlands.
To give a few neurons to the brain drain, the city decided a few years ago, contribute to the general culture and reproduce seven fictitious bridges appearing on euro tickets in the form of pretty small miniatures painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained restricted.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, Rotterdam MVRDV architects, master diagrams into sticks daring and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the Board members looked again, confused and shrug, Maas, the Cheeky, piled his books of choice by order of size to make a pyramid, and finished his speech supported arguments activists by one: "Dear common!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has sprung of Earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project which also included an underground parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
As well as this little dull town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a mayor of a breathtaking ugliness, whose white facades suggests that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under Bell to cheese.
Although a lift transports you to the heart of the massif, the true joys of reading and the architecture are open to you when you walk upon the floor of the building to discover its topography.
Made entirely of glass inside is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floors and elegant street lamps speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking of the gaze of the public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play the ball.
And everywhere from books, books and even books.
"Normally, the library shelves are found along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark, that is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classical spatial configuration and open spaces for reading from the inside to the outside.
The Interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully converted: in the middle are the offices, the Internet chess club library, the centre for the environment and the technical power of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes railings, and staircase ramps.
A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened unwilling unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
Therefore, one day we found in a Frisian farm from ad hoc waste of agriculture.
In the Netherlands, has been used for years of the synthetic membrane of a millimeter in thickness as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and can save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in patches of four centimetres thick.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, uniform and resistant material whose the smell evokes both a new car and sport shoes.
At the top of the 105 markets is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary Café stunning views us over the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Donations for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all glass surfaces, this building is a model project on ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located below a glass Bell, the sun illuminates that little time inside, even on cloudy days.
The thick wooden beams mounted crosswise over the facade of glass are used hood, catching much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds are responsible for the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer specialist, is already risky to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, Professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
There are a few weeks in fact, during the inauguration, everyone was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure resulted in filling the gaps in the library which was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are bursting on all sides.
The architect Winy Maas, "there nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration."
Therefore, MVRDV has reached master discipline called, in professional parlance, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and little educated.
There is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "the Germans must play a greater role."
The Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the State of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, the Germany announced his intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: the Germany does not approve what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the US position.
The Germany wanted to assert its independence, without however to be too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya from March 2011, the Germany had also chose abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
The Germany has difficulties to adopt a clear position about major international issues?
The answer is Yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy that is virtually defined by the Americans, and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are thus faced with several fronts.
Expected them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.
I believe that they still groping to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
That then means the term 'normal' foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows willingness to adopt independent positions to those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by his economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as the Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why the Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany towards the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention in the vote of the United Nations?
The Germany first has significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is certainly a determining factor in German strategic thinking.
The Germany is prejudiced in its relations with the United States by choosing forbearance during important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
This is why I think that the divide is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even that the Germany is more respected.
Indeed, the Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto in a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
Always there were differences due to American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly exercised a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the Government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinions are not so great as they appear always.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflow of enthusiasm for the policy of Netanyahu.
The Germany has difficulty to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the major European partners?
I think that it does not facilitate things for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, but today this is not the case.
They therefore cannot register within a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, the Germany in the future will assume a role of locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of the relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that brand more independence.
The Germany see itself play a role player's weight on the international scene, the Germany wants only to assume a key role?
Or will she always difficulties in leading roles?
The Germany there is still not accustomed, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, the crisis of the euro, we note that whenever the Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands feelings are heard.
It does not facilitate things for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, the Germany is in a much more delicate than the United States position.
It must deal with neighbors and diverse opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy does that decrease, but currently, the EU does not fill this vacuum, then that remains?
Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if it does not, like them even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an Institute in which academics and experts in Europe and North America policy analyse all challenges facing the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of the brands" in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are trademarks known around the world.
Armani Polo... What is it really?
This name hides an officially trademark in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
Mark enjoys protection as well as the company that the name may complain.
And even if she could, it is not sure that she would succeed.
"It is more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the firm Taylor Wessing in violation of the law of property in the far East.
Each week, a new folder is on my desktop.
Imitators have need of some supplementary letters to register their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Gucci read there, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny there.
German companies are also copy legally, like Puma, the maker of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which is located the recordings with the trademark office of the Beijing.
September 14, 2010, a Chinese company created brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company has artificially created in appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are shopping malls on several floors that don't sell nearly as counterfeits.
Pattloch cases are, however, different: its constituents load it to address the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", mark parent.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that are referred to the women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to be ashamed.
"It's bad for business, we must fight against this trend requires Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, damage to reputation are huge."
Financial losses and legal costs are estimated in millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the expensive flagship products.
According to data from the company to market CLSA analysis, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world's luxury goods market and one that develops more quickly.
However, it is not easy to strike questionable records in the register of marks and such procedures are expensive.
These can last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trial in which the Court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period, the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not chance, it may even be required to pay money to the plagiarist, as it would have been detrimental to its brand in China.
In this field, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also cover graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company who came to buy the producer of concrete Putzmeister pumps.
This is the reason that the Chinese can use an emblem resembling the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo logger, used before a blue and white logo that reminded one of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore which had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The CTMO to Beijing trademark office admits however have some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Agency would have happened last year of an "emergency situation in the workflow to a newfound normality".
Thus, the number of opposition procedures untreated would have dropped by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, an increase of 75% compared with the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain overdue at the office.
Act is expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it's a record, and this means that China stands for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new filings in the world.
This would also apply to the total legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Agency would have recognised 1.8 billion yuan in registration fee.
In other words, each record has reported average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle cost more, as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the impersonator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office had therefore dismissed the objection of the Munich.
Freudenberg has certainly won with the two following instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is
Today, the case is pending before the supreme court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he added: "the procedure is long, grueling and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive even had to review acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"It is to this that you can see what it means for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the far East threaten even to spill over into Europe.
It would be the case if imitators of this region ensured the operation of non-protected trademarks.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name of Freudenberg to a production of footwear and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned this area, but it had still been able to prevent the deposition.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is required".
Pattloch and him advising German companies to exercise caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather "Save as in China what is likely to be protected", as says Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle when the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the other party for the use of his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Alternatively, we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping your feet, sing, help
Choral Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS orphans are looking forward to their arrival.
This is the story of a relationship that spans more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, typing of the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men seek the pace hitting the ground of the foot. Soon, they found.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of singers is increasing slowly - Viola, bass, tenor and soprano-, they get carried away, seduce and follow.
Fiete Hopf, Chief conductor of 29 years almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the Orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the salle de musique of the medical psychology Institute of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years old came by the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
' Om'Obani "is not an easy piece, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Be helped to help themselves
UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to fight AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide suffer from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 of the village of Esitjeni AIDS orphans have found sponsors in Germany through the 'Voices for Africa' association.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, one can become sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child's money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi in Zulu means 'storyteller' either still "praise singer".
No one can speak fluently the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing it.
Since almost 10 years, the choir repeated songs in this foreign language that she brought in Germany for now make it to his native region: Southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people with
The village has a population of about 2,000, some live in small huts with straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 between them are orphaned because HIV took away their parents.
At Esitjeni, can be observed on a smaller scale the evils that overwhelm Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the life expectancy the lowest in the world according to UNICEF.
The population accepts virtually never male circumcision, a measure which nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die mid-30s.
Trip group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Especially, the Imbongis saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also about simply everything: food, clothing and education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
Initially, it was only of a few people who undertook personally to pay a few euros every year to send a child to school and to provide one hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir based 'Voices for Africa', an association which deals since then almost professionally of the Esitjeni AIDS orphans.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs, include gonorrhea, syphilis and the chlamydiees (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis virus.
Pubic Lice and scabies are parasitic IST.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often appear among men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, related infections chlamydiees, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of the new HIV infections are observed within this group.
Among the young, there is a rate of infections linked to the chlamydiees significantly higher than among other population groups.
According European surveys, three quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose to 1.967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the occurrence of blisters and warts.
However, they do regularly cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend to anyone often changing sexual partners regularly take examinations.
Most STIs quickly detected can be cured and late sequelae can be prevented.
Through referrals, donations, but especially to the funds that harvest the singers through their voice through the whole Germany, means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros at Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, President of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman itself and who always gets what she wants, manages money from the Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.
Suckers, this so called old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that travelling every day to the hour to school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has more person is welcomed in a place course, Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, 'Voices for Africa' has created a sewing school and enabled the construction of two chicken coops. With the assistance of the American Organization for health PSI, the association has organized a screening test of HIV for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible across the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because this is a subject that affects sexuality."
It is rather odd, coming from a country whose King has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These morals sanctioned by the State, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
We yet find condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
To somewhat promote cultural exchange, the choristers of Imbongi go together on a trip every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence, and black identity that number of inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as he creates not only good humor and joy, but tears sometimes also a tear at some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
Go to Esitjeni, here you will find light, say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, returning to Heidelberg, before these choristers who tap of the foot in the Bergheimer Strasse rehearsal hall, there are also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal 'Science'.
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shade.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 cm up to 20 meters.
Water probably originates of comets or perhaps asteroids that have struck mercury.
However, no one does link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet, explains the Chief Scientist of the Messenger spacecraft, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essentials to life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, such small crevices through which there is infinity.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a 'planet', according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where are born the stars, called "W5", a name somewhat romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
The NASA Spitzer telescope has photographed the blazing brilliance of a star dying.
Donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she died.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, to 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this Galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, also known as "the seven sisters" star clusters can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more value colors.
In this infrared picture, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, viewing directly the spectator.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarities with Earth continent have earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal picture and the infrared photo to watch a spectacular tinge.
Only the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest puzzles of astronomy deals with the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the larger and sharper photographs that has taken the Hubble telescope is the Whirlpool Galaxy.
According to hue, the photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light-years.
The Trifid name comes from the latin word "trifidus" (divided, shared in three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pileup in the constellation Ophiuchus: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are rushing toward the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname of "Southern wheel of fire".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The Nebula is located 1,400 light years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This picture has been developed from optical and x-ray images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes located at 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC" 1810.
In this Nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way Galaxy.
Heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently from young stars 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this Galaxy to direct light and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our eyes on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, until Galileo does it use one year more later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale Observatory's Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa was segmented in order to make savings.
The diameter reaches even about eleven metres.
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Texas telescope is also set at the level of the vertical angle.
Its particularity is its high light-gathering capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this ability is close as the largest telescopes with mirrors of the world.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person a computer owner can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") involving the computing power of his machine.
Views of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also provided for ESO site to the Chile.
Its primary mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of 1,000 items of mirrors.
However, the telescope cannot take snapshots before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian Volcano were regarded as the greatest of the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Observatory on Mauna Kea, which observes the sky with the telescope Subaru and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration to admire it.
However, the most important space images come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he gives us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011, that she had found 1.235 planets candidates since the inception of the mission.
This picture shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The space telescope James Webb (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first infrared space telescope mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will include mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that South pole of mercury is also home to the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because Messenger orbit more near the north pole of mercury.
Radar data indicated the presence of ice on mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit mercury, scientists have now certainty.
Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years
In the South of the Azerbaijan, many people reach ages of the Patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a Museum of longevity.
An investigation on a country, in which we are still relatively young at the age of 97.

An investigation on a country, in which we are still relatively young at the age of 97.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is an offbeat romance.
At the bend of the many turns of the road, the small bus hurtles along wooded hills, torrential rivers and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it feels almost in the black forest.
But we here in the deep South of the Azerbaijan, the Iran border is only a few kilometres.
It is here that lives the Caucasian ethnic group by the name of Talysh, about which it is not much, that they perfectly speak Persian, and azeri and they have a very long service life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the trip from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is much too painful.
It takes eight hours for the 323 km, because the road has only one route.
The province has not yet benefited from legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in may thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will here be the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, the only Museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh in the region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo to black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Still have a child at 136 years
But the controversial star of the Museum is Şirali Muslumov, a shepherd who had 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Muslumov appears more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man is married three times and he had 23 children. At the age of 136, it would have even designed a girl.
Şirali Muslumov is would it be wrong for a few decades by calculating its age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him speak human at the great age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly seniors also live in some areas of China, the Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", explains Scholz, "in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof due to the lack of documents, not to mention that he had no civil status registry.
Every day, a glass of butter melted
Nevertheless, it is a fact that people of the Lerik region often reach a worthy of the Patriarchs of the Bible age.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What therefore is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, Azerbaijan tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the Director of the Museum, think that it is a question of power.
However, it seems not plausible from a nutritional point of view, that meals rich in calories of Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or do what the simple lifestyle that preserves youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the entire region of the Caucasus.
She is sitting on the floor next to a churn, which she beats content endlessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl who are adult long.
Two small children cavort also in the House.
In the kitchen, it prepares tea for the guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of belly.
Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide long braids of a dark blonde son reveals with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and therefore that I have never lost and that they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what comes from his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
My whole life, I never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then, she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything is improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the father figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no bounds in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, later succeeded by his son Ilham.
Whatever it is, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And maybe the son long grizzled of Mirzayeva is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted from the Constitution
The revolution reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations revealed the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy lyrics filled with emotions.
We need to make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he told state television.
His speech was intended to the people as a whole, but also especially the Christian Copts, Liberal, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition members fear.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what wants to save this engineer 61, Ph.d. of the University Southern California American.
The judiciary be overturned?
234 Articles written in a hurry by the predominantly Islamic constituent Assembly of 100 people during a forced night round of fifteen hours are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But that really means the word "principles"?
It was and it remains a question of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that the Islamists use the vague wording and the legal leeway resulting to enforce a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
In any case is that suggests a newly introduced article stipulating that, in relation to all subjects related to Sharia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution of the country and its radiance shines on everyone Islamic Sunni.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto the Trusteeship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts fought to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, can be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and its values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State may even control the content of the cinematography art and literature.
Clearly, it would be just plain censorship.
In addition, no section does expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibited to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what is an offense or how it should be punished.
Also dubious is the wording implying that it is prohibited to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or telling a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, in his own words, will "very soon" be a referendum among the Egyptians.
"The revolution reborn"
The opposition is mobilized for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual concorde on Tahrir square in Cairo, promising to bring down Sharia until it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, arrived third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and it will reverse," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, is not yet atoned for the blood of our brothers," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
Meanwhile, the brotherhood Muslim, well-organized, has called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir square by a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
Veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, were chanting: "the people calls for the application of the law of God."
"Cleans our country!", asked Morsi, stating that "the Koran [was their] Constitution".
A battle for sovereignty over the place Tharir symbolism, where it all began, would have quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood reported that opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way as his supporters, were expressed loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box of the direction to be taken by the country.
Project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this imposed constitutional process that ought to continue until February and encompass all social forces.
This rights lawyer of the 48-year-old man and president of the Egyptian Organization of human human (EOHR) had defended the brothers when they were in jail or in the courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he shared their vision of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible.
This is the reason for which he was severely beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is even not pronounced once in the new Constitution," he complained during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi to the three powers had discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations to the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, president he takes de facto all its powers", deplores Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot operate without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, looking at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could afford.
A protester in Tharir square warns: "you give birth to a monster that you will be able to control."
The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people that inhabit the Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely odorous fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of the most popular foods of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, approximately 3 hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the landscape is spectacular - and that pervasive smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout dusted with salt and fermented in water for a time--on a smell you want it exhales - that can go up to a year.
When darkness settles and it's cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival which takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full-time also known as 'Rakfisk General' charge of the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and slip a large quantity of drink.
"Some people prefer the aquavit to the rakfisk", adds Hansen.
The drink kills the scent.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid doing pass under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds a sushi who would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when the Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in waterproof barrels of water to air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, fish is released and - no doubt with the sense undermined by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals the country was there's not if richer than the Norway long, crossing the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, of the Norway's past.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost €10 each.
The Norway does not often talk about her in the international news, which is not to displease him.
Here, people are not willing to speak with Anders Breivik, the extremist racist right which has killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke the killings, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians have trouble accepting that their peaceful country, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, the Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the sole reason which justifies our success", explains Anna, our waitress, blonde hair and the eyes of a blue piercing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plateau of rakfisk hand.
We are - how do you say - conservative people.
His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discrete, we do not like us to point out.
The Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money in this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw the money down the drain, the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, the Norway was able to keep his purse strings tight.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer make, are happy," said Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk", she added in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I am doing the tail to buy me anything to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
In the menu, a burger consisting of elan, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stayed is one of the many places where are served the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wore a bow-tie, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It feels to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you best fish, in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here our points, Håvard."
Means laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it is because the fumes of fish.
The Mexican Enrique Peña Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
While the President entering Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take up his duties at the Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested to the difficulties that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several access road key in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of the Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation.
A complicated task ahead of him.
The Mexico economy is doing well, the results to be President out Felipe Calderón, but the country is embroiled in a war of drugs that already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Peña Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before rubbing shoulders with the American president, Mr. Peña Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling State which surrounds the capital. On his earth of predilection, opinions regarding this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the common bucolic of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is placed in the memory of all.
Local attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the town, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, significant improvement has been made to these roads, formerly bumpy and full of cracks.
Plates emblazoned with his name are hung outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to implement lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the Congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of safety and economics including, we hope a real change that our country has so much need.
After 81 years without fault in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Peña Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who complain that the new president of lacking charisma.
He is a man whole, very committed, with an excellent view of the country.
He is a great man of State and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people of their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the flyovers of the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military have been called to the rescue to combat drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster area, were found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the Mexico State while Mr. Peña Nieto was Governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to curb the problem of murders against women when he was in Office.
At worst, they accuse her administration to refuse to see the reality in the face.
In a House typical of this neighbourhood, concrete, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it struck me that his body had been washed", tells the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis had already been initiated.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall, next to a cross appears the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
Authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossip, a hero of disorder, a such.
They want that we accept what they say and we keep silent.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president made the promise that it would be his priority during his tenure.
"I hope it will be as good as president than when he was Governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, Member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse which Bradley Manning allegedly subjected during detention.
The trial focuses on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that sequestration of Manning is made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show, Friday, the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being responsible for the leakage of confidential information of the history of the US Army - has missed many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during its nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaint about his treatment.
The cross-examination--during a hearing, the defence presented a motion demanding that the Manning case is closed on the grounds that sequestration was made under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment - took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide while in custody.
This analyst military, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein has discussed with Manning the forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers have asked Manning and recorded her answers.
When Fein spoke forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment of its guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had within the prison was overall "very professional."
Forms are State of no complaint for ill-treatment, although officers have directly questioned him about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning responded that he had orally expressed concerns about some problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they occupy, but they have not recorded the problems mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after having addressed the concerns), and so far, this does not mean that I had not raised any problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col.. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained his treatment in an interview in January 2011 with the special commission which had met to discuss suicidal thoughts he expressed in writing a few months previously.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to modify its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said that they had assigned this restrictive status - one level below the monitoring close to suicide risk - for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to let staff know that I was OK, and I wanted to removing this Statute... in order to have a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the body of the Marines at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said having considered suicide when he was in the Kuwait and to be vanished once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of having been failed aware of what would happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
'My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage', said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said that he had spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
Manning also added that the only objects available to him were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, because sleep or lie during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eye, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they waking up it in order to see his face.
Counsel for Manning filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also, on Friday the judge asked questions to Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday - after being forced to sleep naked every night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other inmates one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time he was permitted to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
For issues of Justice, Friday, Manning said he had inferred from the order of his bodyguard that he should drop its coverage that could hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered the release.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night as he allegedly tried to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or its flip flops to get hurt, but that he had not done.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will consider he has experiences during his detention and that it will greatly reduce his sentence should it be recognized guilty by a court martial, a trial that should take place early next year.
The defence said that Manning plans to plead guilty to the less serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning has been jailed in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The counts against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all the counts are included, he incurs the imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; They remind Mexicans difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette said that Mexican Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what file to direct me.
I grew up in Central California, where you called me the 'Mexican' all my life.
This is an ethnic epithet, in the same way than that my Boston friends use when they are "Irish", or my friends in New York when they say "Italian".
Then, I have become "American".
But, here, it was the Mexico.
And on earth that has seen rise to my grandfather, no need of special qualifier or hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage a conversation in one or the other language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and headed the "Foreign" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has visited with President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto had also wanted to talk to the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that drive Mexicans to stay at the Mexico rather than risk to the United States.
He wished to ally the United States and the Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Peña Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the Mexico drug cartels, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded the Mexico and forced its leaders to cede writing half of their territory at the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of the Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elites - of complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma seeking the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want that it deals with bitterness?
There are many.
The Mexico has its winners and its losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, perhaps only at one point in our family tree, a person, a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity to the Mexico and had to go in the North.
And more often, this person was a profile type - a skin dark, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we currently live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they stand as if we were individuals of lower and not enough Mexican strain.
Our Spanish is not good enough, our links with the Mexico will never strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in the Mexico, they would never be gone.
And we do not would be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States while she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans more firmly assert their identity and the Mexican Americans are upset.
Although citizen American, she feels to be part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexico-Americans I know do not have the impression to be part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we consider as Americans.
And for the United States, are considered as Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, part of the intelligentsia and some Mexican leaders want closer to the Diaspora.
They want that Mexican Americans work as ambassadors of fortune for the Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We explain to our fellow Americans that the Mexico is a beautiful country that he must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with the Mexico.
Yes of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption and violence linked to the drug that are ubiquitous, many of us are not persuaded that it is a fantastic country.
You will need to manage only, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for how they have treated the Mexico a century ago and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans to want them always how members of their family have been treated there not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old feuds, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Could there ever be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While persist the same futile arguments about which began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed. and, for the first time, the rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their past conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has done everything shattered, and that like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify further.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help break the deadly deadlock.
A war that is no loser or no winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the cease-fire granted November 21 continues, fighting this week have strengthened proponents of the force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which runs the Gaza since 2007, pretend to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and repressed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most wretched and overcrowded of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is becoming increasingly strong, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full swing, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has been done and cause for Hamas; just like the Qatar, one of the richest States and the most dynamic of the Golf.
Members of Hamas jubilant and say that the Islamic Crescent curve around Israel from the Lebanon in the North, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, through Syria, where the trend Islamist rebels can topple Bashar Al-Assad, to the Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the King.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders more easily rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player of significance that will no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hard-line of Israel will draw opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas presented in box.
The interception of missile system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and numerous missiles of Hamas was destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for awhile.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being responsible for the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main chip of what could be a Palestinian State, and that protects the Jewish settlements which continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman to the approach of the election of January 22, has the beautiful part.
Why pampered pesky Palestinians giving them a State?
If they ran the West Bank, not launch not rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind the wall and strike them as soon as they exit the head.
Maybe the hard line supporters prevail; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the situation.
Even though the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere enjoy little Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
The budget of the defence of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbors gathered.
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab Governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire which is a good omen - and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world which becomes more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The Suppression already weakened democracy in the Jewish State, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to strike Hamas will have a price diplomatically.
Both sides need to be driven by those outside.
The answer remains as advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and this newspaper: two States, with a cession of territory by Israel in Exchange for safety.
A small and short-term, is hope that the cease-fire will give the opportunity to people outside to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now tackle to end the flow of arms to Gaza, in the same way that the Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish State in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to they unite.
It would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian State that the proposal next a pseudo State at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has any interest in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish a.
It is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital for America challenge.
It passes through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
For packs of cigarettes neutral laws came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a first world, logos and colours have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of diseased organs and representations of children and babies including diseases caused by tobacco use from their parents.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, small print on all packages.
It is the strictest regime in the world on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal Government said that the objective was to dissuade young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% likely that they never begin.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco through their brand image", said the federal Minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed for example that children associated the Crown of a logo with a Princess.
Even if the Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
The tobacco industry said it would reopen trade in the black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"Negative consequences will flow from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have stated that this Act had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of IBA Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide horrible packaging, increased sharply ago two months since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
HA said that Zico sold 6,000 wholesalers and is waiting for the renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements in TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to conceal the cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
The Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites to make.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have more that a small storefront to promote your products, the Internet is the place par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens for brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who gave the sentence to make a video, or whether it was a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went up to pay the Ukraine, the Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries reported to who that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had important commercial exchanges with the Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar legislation on packaging.
The Canada was the first country to make obligatory pictures of warning on the packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including the Brazil, the Turkey and the Ukraine.
Stronger laws are currently under review in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these pictures.
The photos do not bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you ranges package," said Victor El Hage when purchasing a package on which is superimposed a photo of tumor of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that will make me stop, she is my little girl.
James Yu, Managing Director of "King of the Pack tobacconist' in the centre of Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"Before, I had an hour to unload a package now, it takes me four hours" said Yu.
"The Government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's good, you stop and put the key under the door", he added, by raising their arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Spend half a day in an airport to wait for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines, and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in the development of the child praise of boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting paths, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most constantly to several types of screens, we know more the benefits of boredom.
Then should we welcome with open arms boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But I will come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially now that we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, in the Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble dates back to far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then, there's the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
Many publications and submitted the idea to a panel of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues identified boredom as an experience that is "wanting to do something, but to engage in activity."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not currently undertake a task though it wished.
With apathy, he said, he did not want to do something.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a sullen mood and feel that time passes slowly."
Boredom may strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
We sometimes think that we we bored while it is in fact a concentration problem.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted a more ancient experience in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the room side, too high sound from a TV show that had no relationship, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all hear the soundtrack.
Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level said they were more annoyed that the other two groups - they have struggled to focus, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a task difficult or involved, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you to not bother you."
In fact, he said, now, we know that when we squirmed or on scribbled gestures, often considered as signs of trouble, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to swing learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," said Professor Fenske.
We bored we all one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotone voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "proneness to boredom scale" in the 1980s.
Scale includes statements like, "One of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I did not have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovic, a Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and particularly need many and varied stimuli.
But in general, adolescents are quickly jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a Professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It noted that 32 percent of teens reported getting bored at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its highest level", particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I based my question: the trouble is good for you?
Sometimes not, as in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way that the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the thing most appropriate to do so.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and to Cook, this will make happy.
But if you look at the TV, this will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it annoy more, but it has not learned to deal with alone or is autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
And "this subsidiarität passes from one situation to another," he said.
Your child learns not only to be entertained, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I do not think that we should glorify boredom.
Just as I also do not think we should criticize him.
Feel uncomfortable outside constant boiling that generate activity and technology is the goal towards which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.
"We need us bored more often, but boredom awakens a shrill and frantic desire to be connected to something that has meaning", he said.
According to him, what people are looking for, it is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés', he added,"it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying in a University and in Colorado soccer player, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his State: possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that can be used in its consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We're treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it a?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote in Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on rather than of the Act.
Here and in Washington State, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further action.
Police services have ceased to indict adults aged 21 and for minor possession of marijuana over, because the Act will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in the districts more conservative Colorado were called to accelerate existing marijuana business and continue to indict people who have.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West currently vote to prevent the opening of shops for the sale of marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I do not know what the future holds", said Daniel J. Oates, the Chief of police of Aurora, East of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also quite a lot of questions.
They are looking for instructions on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most States in regulation of marijuana, firstly concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regards to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more that suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could build, he said.
The law of Washington, called I - 502, takes effect December 6, leaving a legal vacuum for one year, during which the permit system does not, still exist while possession of marijuana would be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate from the State that ensures appropriate access to marijuana approved and prohibited the installation of shops for the sale of cannabis within a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground game or a nursery.
"It only there will be not more difficult than urban areas to install a commerce approved sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre of legalisation of cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of police, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Crown) continue more persons 21 years and more who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to indict people for this type of offence "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that police would apply new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in Northern Colorado, "district attorney" (public prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said that his Office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on users to do detoxify.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our Office has an obligation to take action against those who have committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the County, is no longer appear to adults for possession of small amounts.
The representative of the public prosecutor of the County, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided to not classify no further all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I don't have the impression of wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters argued the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework suitable for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that were observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"There is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents people accused of marijuana use, and expressed as local spokesperson for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (national organization for the reform of marijuana laws).
"They spent much of their lives to prosecute people who consumed marijuana, too, have struggled to accept that this is legal", he said.
As first States to treat consumption restricted marijuana at the same level of alcohol, Colorado and Washington State are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and representatives of the State provide a new frontier of legalized sales, they expect with concern the guidelines of the federal Government, which designs always the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana advocates hope that the Department of Justice will.
Despite some arrests publicized and patients on therapeutic marijuana sellers, the federal Government has especially helped shops for the sale of marijuana for therapeutic exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other States.
While it is true that the police will probably not push the doors to enter the small bags of drugs, it is hard to bet that it opposed to licensed shops for the sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the Obama administration policy.
Many cities in Colorado do not have expected that the federal authorities act.
Well before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the establishment of new shops for the sale of marijuana, even if it is a one-year deferral.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a 6-month moratorium and should impose the ban next week.
"We don't want not find ourselves in a situation where a licence is granted to someone and then find us a federal problem", said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote in the State.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford, because I was a 'Tory' (conservative).
It is not only the students of today are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed to enter the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a kind of latter-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after me be installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study history, I decided to make my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I had left this University because I had objected the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with joke that I was a party after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been harassed and subject to constant bullying.
Not because my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential of Margaret Thatcher recommended and I was a proponent of the conservative party.
Why mention this now, you might say.
And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students undergo the same type of persecution.
Hatred growing and institutionalised Tory to Oxford students is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, the same as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the room of the Corpus Christi College students (JCR) stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt adverse" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the Committee of the University for the equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary aired on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("the country of wonders: young, smart and right"), devoted to the policy among students, and which depicted the "Tories" as the eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It is discovered including student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", which moves a Rolls-Royce, sports a silver full and moves with a chrome head cane.
In other universities, conservative students say be treated as scapegoats of the implementation of the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20-year-old Vice-Chairman of the 'Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper"that there's a bias of left growing in the universities.
People think that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history at Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Sara, 19 years old, the OUCA President, said there had been a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the JCR for persons who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as to the welfare of the members", she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then aged 18 and a crippling shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent.
The previous year, the University had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in the financing of higher education.
The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.
From the early days of the week, when new students met with other professors, I got a taste of what was going to happen eventually.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the taunts towards the Tory students, but that increasingly, they were fun.
It was as if policy about minors strikers, privatization and the Government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa was engraved into the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm which I was victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt", said the Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost a foot.
Pitt, a small man with Pustular face, won easily.
"Is the Thatcheristes refuse to learn the French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
Other students laughed.
Tears burned me eyes.
"I suggest you to take courses in French in your spare time - Finally, if you're not too busy to make friends", launched in a surly tone.
I returned to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and then I felt a slight Pat on my shoulder.
It was a student in the second year of studies in English, named James, who ran as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, kindly.
I am afraid that so be it.
Any person suspected to be a Tory (conservative) is taken to target.
It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most of the Tory youth claim to be of Labour (labour).
Later, at the local pub, loosely tried to hide me.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy has failed.
A student in first year of philosophy, political science and economics which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories do love?" asked one of them.
They will hit each other, isn't it?"
I felt as homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Only could I lead a normal life at Oxford?
I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the dusk?
Should I have become Labour and denying my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of stigma and isolation.
The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history, who taught at my University.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Advisor on foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here", he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parent's House in London, finding refuge with my family and my mind more open urban friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They would not, not in the city of dreamy spires.
Even my communist friends were blameless ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it is to tease you.
This will break me the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a session of tutorials the following week, when another professor of history suggested more seriously world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Internally blushing with shame, I admitted being a victim of brainwashing by my parents and made them of "old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
It is my father who drove the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At this time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I am still lurking in my room, and my pursuers dropped out after five minutes.
When they left, I did my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I am never returned.
You can treat me of maudlin WIMP.
But no child 18 years should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produces 14 Tory Premiers, but also benefits from a steadfast reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefer elegance to prominence"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: a master de la Couture", a prestigious retrospective which brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his own couture during the past 50 years.
'I love this Palace', he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "it signore" Garavani, but that could have been written without her famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing by the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes her personal memories as trophies of his social climb: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, North of the Italy, the idol of the international jet - set.
There is nothing wrong with loving the kingship.
"At least they do not overwrite their butts of cigarettes on your beautiful carpet as do some stars of pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receive with generosity and elegance.
"We loved all be invited in his Gstaad chalet", explains wife's "Heini" Thyssen, girlfriend intimate beauty of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to prominence.
And even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The argentine model Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charism of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest feel important and appreciated", recalls the top model, who began working with him during the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass mode, because his creations are works of art," says.
Parade of noble lineage
The life of Garavani isn't an obsessions but shared love story.
He loves the well-behaved people and with the greatest titles and they also like it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty metres wide which proposes to Exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and should scroll on the podium to admire a 'public' dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristote Onassisthe costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
This audience of mannequins, include names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember perfectly.
It was pants, a shirt, a jacket "gillette" and a jacket of the collection fall-winter 1971-1972.
"It is a gift that he had made me," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the couturier.
"I prefer it to all others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it enhances our beauty", adds ex - Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and waisted Patricia della Giovampaola D'Arenberg cannot, it will not forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed to have age and the chance to wear one of his evening dresses...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first template Valentino for a feast in the castle of my cousin, prince Edouard's line.
It was a red evening dress with a skirt with Ruffles, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," says the Italian Aristocrat who divides his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses by the designer with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, she is also all the memorabilia that it conveys".
The 'King' of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibit is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (fashion designer so called his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a train of four metres and a half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture from the end of the 20th century, "the return of the high society clients".
Obsessed for years with "savoir-être" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the order of Arts and letters, decorated with the Legion of honour, Garavani combines as many honours as any husband of her clients.
"Its refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect aspect always jumped me in the eyes", recognizes D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago in a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was spotless, the years have no effect on him".
If it is a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, holders of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 pounds of sulfur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living with sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano East of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies at contact air.
After tallying of large sulfur rocks, weighing in total nearly 70 pounds, it installs them in two baskets of bamboo it loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 metres to the Summit of the volcano which rises to 2.386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a speed of turtle, in keeping the balance and measuring their steps to not stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that a misstep could cost them life, as has happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilo of extract sulphur.
Once at the top, it is their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were beasts of circus, and painfully carrying heavy baskets, they walk the 3 km up to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It comes to PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and can say, its employees, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
She then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, Fireworks, cosmetics, of dynamite and is used even to bleach sugar.
"As we move about 70 kilos, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips per day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but this allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem to be a misery for a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the harvested coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) a day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the holder who once worked as a Mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned near his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I reduced it to Java to have it convert to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years old, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the link Kawah, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the Bill although he covers himself with a mask face and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It is the price he must pay to pursue her dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or the French" he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Mauled by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it does the job of a mule.
He shared a hovel of unhealthy wood with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not stop gushing out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Defying darkness, Anto descends into the crater in illuminating with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, he bought is is himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of the sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment porters who are self-employed and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they will not affect nor a 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that this natural park guards charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a portly bearer of 42 years who works at Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that it will not stop work "so" he can, because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Well that sulphur damage the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that person complains to suffer serious illness... in addition to obviously their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and him extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, that three trucks carrying the Tamansari warehouse, 18 km away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik well opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30 years, also works as bearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: one that make the human mules of the volcano Kawah link.
Singapore search babies to save the economy
Singaporeans cast the responsibility for this lack of children on the career, the stress and the cost of access to the property.
"The population of Singapore shall grow".
I'm a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for pellets with Mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube to Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local as references "Will put an open secret in the drawer" to mock the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the origin of the video advertising agency, hopes to draw attention to the problem in an amusing way through this advertising.
Its Creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wished to use the power of music to make people fill "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
It is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of the birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we must address.
We knew that the Government had tried several things as launch perfumes with pheromones or arrange speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following thing: what's more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore will take as many lightly.
It spends 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government to the marriages and fathers provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, longer maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city-state rich and high-tech Southeast of Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time found above 2, considered as the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why so Singaporeans are no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the marriage and family of the National Division of the Population policies, says that it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the establishment of a family," she says.
These changes in social norms contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and to delay marriage and births, which results a decrease of the birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increase immigration to counter the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abounds a barely disguised xenophobia against immigrants, especially to the Chinese who are accused of pull wages down and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore known last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the election, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and taxes higher for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The Government is attempting to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale won great success.
However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a style of single life and discourage developers wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes build much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is far more cost-effective for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to proponents, who was previously sticks in the wheels if they wished to propose too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards the increase in the national birth rate, by talking with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of downtown, it would seem that they do not go to have lots of effects.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, like education, it is to this that people deliver to later", said a young framework.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time", says another youth of twenty years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to the property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the Government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, they are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is a private offline is a private online
Confidentiality
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it's the quality of the private or domain 'domain of life private that we can protect any intrusion'.
What is EC that is in the domain private for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Understand the dangers to which they are exposed by broadcasting on the Internet of the events it would certainly not share offline?
Elperiodico newspaper questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they have associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I do not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he owned an account two years ago.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," says.
On FB, I post Nice pictures or games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I do share one of my photos or someone who would do the fool," he said.
The young boy recognizes it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge is that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are in the family.
Her mother is part, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account for to speak me and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if they tell me, I will simply post", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or my friends quickly", he said.
He says that he would never accept the demand of an unknown person.
He will not trust someone who he would recommend a foreigner.
The case of Jose, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits did not know 20 people on their friends list.
"This don't care because we have something in common, for example music", he says.
According to the boy, nobody did it advances or not asked his address or phone number.
"If put me pressure or demanded, I would delete them just my account", he acknowledges.
José is subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiences what is known today as the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the boy.
A close to one of my friends was racketté on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was" he assures us.
The victim, according to José, has not closed its account.
"It it was only passed in private profile".
He then explained a series of manipulations to set up his account in a safe manner.
In contrast to Jorge, this young posterait pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or pissed off.
"Even though I know that it is the Cyberstalking", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, Professor of English and m.a. in Education and learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents, should understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed", she says.
Porras said that the Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and digital immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, it is they, the children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We, we are digital immigrants who must teach them, while we ourselves trying to learn", she says.
It adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a criterion set to what it should be or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to make".
"We also ask them to be selective so that what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences" she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way of teaching privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Tell them to not do so is useless", she says.
Then, Porras lists some examples: there are things that you did before to a stranger, why do you on the Internet?
Or that you would like it, that they publish a picture of you as a friend that you have published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identified photos from celebrations, you ask others permission to identify?
And also, everyone needs to know what you do every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, each must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks", she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, primary teacher and education advisor, said that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish", said.
Guardia, it is essential to remind children that do not talk to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration be made public
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) ended today in the Peru, while the Lima Declaration was made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 present agents.
EfE has tried several times to access the document signed during the life ordinary meeting of Heads of States and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported initially that it would be disclosed after the close of the Summit, and then said that it would be published from one moment to the other on the Web site of the Peruvian Government.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content was exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists access to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day, only video without sound of the presidential House with the message "private, audio session restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating between the journalists were given by the press officers of some of the Unasur Governments attending the appointments, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of present presidents, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, President of the Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the Summit, but it was the speech president Humala and not the official document which concluded the Summit.
Last October, the Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit of South American-Arab countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although asked with authority by the press, it had not broadcast either the declaration also called Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA can check that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to implement the secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited maximum information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint agreement of the Chile and from Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which decides a different frontier between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered during the regional meeting and stated that they would abide by the decision of the ICJ to hear arguments from both sides in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago and which opens on Monday in the Hague.
"We will respect and implement the verdict that will resolve disputes that we wear today before this International Court", said the president Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversies, the treaties and international tribunals", said president Piñera giving a handshake to the president Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ was held after the Colombia have denounced this week the Pact of Bogota whereby it agreed to submit to the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with the Nicaragua which it saw as seriously flawed.
The Summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and the Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the Rendez-vous.
President host, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations the morning and close the Summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects were set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place of "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess joint and effectively the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) does not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and foresee a better future for our peoples," concluded president Humala.
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that enhance the connection of areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and by generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were for the Peru and were located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to the Brazil, and that two were a more important with the Ecuador connection although it gave no further details.
Similarly, the final document said the political situation in the Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow his reinstatement in the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and had good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the Summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of the Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through from a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with president Daniel Ortega", said president Santos.
"We will revise all of these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with the Nicaragua who will ask to have a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope to say to president Ortega that we are going to adjust this from the more civilized and respectful way possible", said president Santos.
Santos and Ortega presidents will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they planned to attend power of this country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet prior to approve the Action Plan by the year 2013, which tries to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
The Argentina, the Bolivia, the Colombia, the Ecuador, the Peru, the Brazil, the Uruguay, the Venezuela, the Chile, Guyana, Surinam and the Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
The Peru the Presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The president of the Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the establishment of a common citizenship was a goal for which "of South America, in this case, should take example on Europe".
President Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state TV Peru television, killed each that Europeans "to were other during the second world war" and during other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship promoted by the Member countries of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past" he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president is shown for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective to decrease the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who have bombarded do never compromise is nothing, on the other hand, we, Americans, signed it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States", he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but he instead adhered to its "deep democratic and human rights values".
It was concluded that at the time, "there was based suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice who demanded to submit its territory to an interrogation concerning an alleged sexual offence while "own Swedish legislation allows to do by videoconference, what could be done from the Ecuador Embassy in London".
CORREA said that there was a risk that Assange physical and mental health is deteriorating.
"I do not talked to him since it is located in our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being enclosed in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"This is the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa noted that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the allocation of a safe-conduct allowing him to go to Ecuador, lies between the hands of Britain, the Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that he held discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, the Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "If Britain gave the safe-conduct tomorrow, would this end".
And if the Sweden as quite allowed its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned her via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be also solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he stressed that he would not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that impair freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of the greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
From this angle, it praised that it is not this kind of journalists "neither bankers nor hegemonic and bourgeois countries which dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than put forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue the path and the good path".
Correa has also supported the decision to keep the veto on the Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing the Agency "should stand firm and do not tolerate the opportunism and the disguised coup d ' état attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with the Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of the Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
Need to solve them as a whole to exceed them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confident in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between the Peru and Chile within the same court and stated that it is "beneficial to Latin America to seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment if it is".
With reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, to seek a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though this is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has ensured that, if he lost the primaries of February 2013, he would retire from public life.
At the personal level, power is never interested me, but also unjust situations that those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty cannot be resolved through power politics.
"My political movement believed it was me who ensured the eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential mandate and I retire from political life.
If ever we lose, I do also.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also refers to new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, Cuba.
I just chat with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the year to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the State of health of president Chávez", he commented.
The head of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of Nations South American (Unasur) which was completed by a call to greater regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen to me on the head," he said, referring at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man has hidden it from his family.
He decided to take only his illness and began to inquire about its subject and his determination was such that it comes to celebrate his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of unity of HIV of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), found in 1994 after many battles in which it is.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment options and over stigma.
Then, even the Director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided him say goodbye "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient having started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the unit of HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information was posted in April of this year in a scientific publication prestigious.
The infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was more a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that had patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those consuming drugs: up to 30 years at a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Put simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis in 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years", explained the scientist questioned.
In order to put this progress in its context, you should know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality decreased significantly these past years, in the case of the Mexico, people have died from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died.
As Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; However, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
Then why t-there still deaths?
I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is as I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we never ran out of drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or so they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive then that they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is achieving earlier diagnoses and, for that, we must propose testing on a mass basis, to all persons requesting".
Specialists and members of the Council of State of Jalisco (Coesida) HIV prevention agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has to do its testing in a laboratory private, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already infected with AIDS, and suffered from Kaposi's Sarcomaa cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it is better that I'm having three times a week", they say, this is not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-lead, I pay attention to me and to the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to assist, through his testimony, those who fear today, when walking the world day against AIDS.
Them to the test, if they took risks, more they will know early if they are HIV-positive and better it will be, and whether they already have the diagnosis, to them to know that one can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps in health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before it gave us one or two, now it gives us packets of one hundred, is all very well, but the result, that today ' even today, some do not have access to condoms", he says.
The most vulnerable to new infections include adolescents.
The question: "what will you do?" asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at counters, but they are found in public restrooms distributors and in places that attend youth.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is also not pay girls and the motel, as had answered the Governor Emilio González when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not as that works sexuality, best is to provide condoms to those already active sexually", he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and HIV 1.317).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination are sexually, 6% through blood and 2% by perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each registered cases, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a court in the United States ignores the restructuring of debt of the Vitro group granted via a commercial bankruptcy to the Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and with solvency problems.
It seems therefore that procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country in the stars and stripes, in opposite of international agreements.
From a point of view practice, the blow in the judgment rendered June 15 by judge Harlin Hale of the Court of bankruptcy for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the leading manufacturer of glass of the Mexico enter the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case reports that creditors must register according to the law on bankruptcy of the United States, the Court of appeals for the fifth circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalised at the Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the case of insolvency of companies having a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations model for the uniformity of International Law Commercial law had been established to this end taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
In the second place, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro towards the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro isn't the first to use this plan.
Here, there are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Institute Federal Commercial bankruptcies had guarantees the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, since there were the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. funds "vulture" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have received the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A fact omitted by the appeal tribunal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation that he met since 2008 without stopping at the grave economic crisis that faced the United States, reflecting the cost to the country.
For now, the Gonzalez Sada family society interjettera call before the same Court of appeal so that the vote be held in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three voted.
The use of insurance will require the non-prosperite and requires the revision of the trial by a higher tribunal, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the tribunal ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro as part of commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that it was liberating of the agreements signed by the two countries to the same level as section 15 of the Act on bankruptcy in the United States.
In addition, he noted that the country has complied with the principles of the Commission of the United Nations concerning International trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pileup of both parties: they knock Vitro and they knock the country.
General assessment
Complaints from trade unions of the Mexican society of Aviation against the ex-boss of the company, Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, was passed over in silence for several months, it was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des pilot Airmen had already problems.

They besieged the Dragon Mart
Gathered this weekend in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national environmentalists and foreigners, some university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society have approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge Center of sale and distribution to the Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the countries of the great wall, with an area of housing for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of industry and the Transformation) had managed to unite the area of southeastern Governors to oppose the monumental project which is located in part on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "basketball is my life"
The globe-trotting of basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relationship with the land and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that until cerebral hemorrhage not condemned to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been submerged in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player's lower leagues, the national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore many hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN, Director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s", recalls Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes not exaggerating when he made this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated pictures and memories that recall its route out of standards, evidenced.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, that he loves the most are those who remind her its passage as a player the team of the Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years in both that co-manager or team manager.
"This has been my best years, those which I have benefited the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Championships of the Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or officer."
Done many years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then removed at the Championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been directing here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a tough player for you, it measures two meters.
You want it?"
This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that has had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed in Bayamon to win a Championship, Gauss would help us try to win another.
It pleased the Championship of the Vaqueros with Gauss, but only remotely because in 1988 he was already the honcho of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its loads and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States in the pre-Olympic tournament of Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the world of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge us not had replay the last game, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World team the best national team you've seen?
It is part of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we put a beating on the United States team, which was quite similar to that which had won bronze at the world.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Kelly" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend the world 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquen in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognoses.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
No doubt it comes to Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Person in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculin.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he played.
That was the best leader Puerto Rico?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work done Leo Aijaz.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Have part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What is there to do?
There are things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalisation of the minor categories.
For example that Ponce boys play only in their area and faced only teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, youth travel and play too much while this is not necessarily required.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watching videos of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend basketball games.
And of course, I'm enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, came to prominence internationally by the role Chief John Ross Ewing, more known under the name of J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a businessman without scruples, formidable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, the role of oil Tycoon without scruples J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The associated Press for the Warner Bros. production of "Dallas" House.
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas playing again ironic that he loved the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his close friends were with him to Dallas in this holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and he will be greatly missed me.
"He was a person of exception and he lived life fully," said Gray in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he acknowledged much drinking for many years.
In 1995, had detected it a malignant tumor to the liver and he had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was known to television in the role of a regular type in "I dream of Jeannie" series broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In the latter, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and he brought it home.
He also played in two comedies that remained shortly on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles, are roles well received by critics in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS channel on the Ewing clan and their relatives was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around a full of emotions episode in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation all over the world and millions of dollars in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at this time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second program of the most-watched entertainment in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which was attended by 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had put her enclosure and had then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to assault him.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to make Internet his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be as Epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
Should write: "here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Here is the only part that he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, recalled Friday of Hagman as of a man "huge, both on the small screen as in life".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us who were fortunate to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes is already complete for the second season and a sixth is in the process of realization, informed the chain.
For now, neither Warner nor the TNT channel provided on the manner in which the death of Hagman will be integrated into the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who enjoyed fame with classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stages of theaters in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young interior decorator Swedish Maj Axelsson and married to him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian City of Malibu, where reside many celebrities.
In 2001, he entitled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': the ruthless memoirs of J.R)
"I did not write anything in this book that can injure or affect it in any way", he said to the press at this time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active militant of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise, I gives them confidence, I come up with them when they come to surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to provide a little comfort, like "don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it will go well".
He was also a militant against tobacco and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "end of the world" has begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the religion Professor Stuart charm has decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he launched here an irresistible hook: the end of the "big count" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, to which refer many people as being evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor charmed had no idea what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the time thought to trigger the apocalypse.
"I did not realized this was going to be the half of the most apocalyptic that I've never known", said this week the charmed teacher to his students of Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we tell, this has been a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is wrong is good for those who believe in the revelation.
And it is not the only Professor to give a course on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker conducts the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guide certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
Pennsylvania State University main campus, Professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct of history of Art and anthropology, have teamed to give a course simply entitled "the end of the world".
"We add"2012"to have the opportunity to teach the course again, in the case where the world does would disappear not", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "impending disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave to the student choice to work "until the night of the end of the world supposedly", said Restall.
The courses proved to be pretty popular.
"It was full in two hours," said Restall about his course intended for students from high-level, consisting of 35 students.
We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on the part of people who asked if there was still the place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to comfort," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of age 23, born in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and nursing of 25 years, says watching all apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this material", he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the surveyed students, and less a Professor, did tell us believe in the date of end of the world December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited it," said Julie zegle, student of last year at Temple, 21 years old and originally from West Chester.
The Maya were never predicted the end of the world, it's only a date key on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other parts of the globe, the les gens people do not think this", he says.
It is in most of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion of the La Salle University who lectures in the Philippines this year, quickly replied when asked if he knew that on here gave courses on "the end of the world".
'The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world', we-a-t-il replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about many supposed doomsday dates, and stated that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately start to think about the next date" or to philosophise on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us they thought going to parties "at the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, student in communications of 20 years.
