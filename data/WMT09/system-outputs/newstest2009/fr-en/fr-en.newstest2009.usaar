At the end of the exchanges the stock market Prague went over to the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the grant of Prague r√©ctifia its losses. 
The transactions with the actions reached almost half the exchanges daily usual. 
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges the Stock Exchange Prague renewed with his fall of the eve, while it lost nearly six percent. 
This time the reduction is owed to the fall of the actions in on Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market in view of the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the sector financial American, is thus perceptible also by us. 
Fall of actions in Asia 
The Asian grants lived Tuesday a dramatic fall, even if the indices succeeded, in the course of the day, of erasing a part of the losses. 
The clue Hang Seng of stock exchange Hong Kong lost four percent during the exchange, but later, it erased a part of the losses and reduces the reduction to nearly 2,5 percent. 
The clue Hang Seng China Enterprises in accordance with the movement of the Chinese actions of the stock exchange Hong Kong lost 3,8 percent, the markets being closed at Shanghai. 
The actions of the grant of Sydney lost more than five percent, but finally one succeeds in reducing the losses to 4,3 percent. 
According to its index the stock exchange Taiwan lost 3,6 percent. 
"The hesitation about the action of rescue in the USA will influence on the stock markets of the world," observed Joseph Yam, the leader of office Monetary Hong Kong. 
although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes his monetary policy itself, it is - to say independently about the Chinese central bank. 
The rates of interest have the same level at Hong Kong as in the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators in a fast way should recover the negotiations and to adopt the proposal of supports of the financial system. 
Otherwise, one would risk that other countries undergo the effects. 
The bloodbath of actions American 
On Monday, the American House of Representatives threw back the draft of supports of the financial system, to which it should have devoted jusqu 'to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 worry of K). 
The legislators renounced thus the call to the supports of the project of President George Bush. 
According to Bush the project should solve the main causes of the crisis financial and would have to help the whole economics to stabilize. 
The actions American lived on Monday, a bath blood and the main indices actions experienced the biggest fall of the last 20 years. 
index Dow Jones lost close to seven percent, having experienced a fall of such a wingspan for the time in 1987. 
The clue lost already during the vote, but while it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in freefall. 
The Conference gave in: the government of the USA can inject 700 billion dollars in the banks 
The leaders of the Congress and the government of the president George W. Bush have started of agreement on a form broader of the agreement of financial help to the system financial American. 
it will be subjected to vote at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators carried out a watershed in the talks on the adoption of a plan of rescue under the form of a financial help of an amount of $(approximately 12 billion kronor), matched to the American financial system. 
The success is not sure for all that. 
Indeed, before being able to publish the final version of the law and subjecting it to on vote, the Congressmans must finish some number of details of agreement. 
The plan of supports of the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Says Sunday to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the committee of the rules banked and financial of the house. 
According to sources, on Wednesday as soon as possible, the plan would owe priori a to be subjected to the vote in the Senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement of the fact that the plan of rescue will be adopted should constitute a first major psychological factor to revive the stock markets. 
Yet, being given the complexity of the mechanisms thanks to which aid the markets can be real, a "disillusion" will follow. 
Paulson: The plan must be efficient 
"we have realized great progress. 
we have settled our divergent opinions regarding the form that the package of measures should have as the stabilization of the market, "entrusted to the Agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to it the vote final could be carried out from Sunday. 
In the night from Saturday to Sunday representatives of legislators met the American Finance minister Henry Paulson, in order to give a final form to the bottom of the government. 
This should purchase, next to the financial societies, the unsaleable active ones property that take the financial firms in losses huge and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety. 
"We are to becoming from agreement on a plan that will work and that must be, also, efficient on the market about. 
It is needed still to hound this plan of recovery with of markets, but I think that we are to it, "said Paulson. 
A signal to the exchanges Asian 
The financial world crisis has sizeable incidences on the markets of actions that fall. 
According to the democratic senator did not escape Harry Reid, the legislators make so that the Conference leads to a definitive agreement from Sunday. 
They wish to calm thus the investors before the beginning of the exchanges on the Asian stock markets, which are situated in the first zone time, where the decision's Congress could influence on the exchange of Monday. 
Yet, for the instant, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Bedrooms of the American Conference comes out to the vote, nor if the negotiations do not risk to remain blocked, at the last time, by this or that problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the days to come. 
Nevertheless the law will experience still many changes. 
The total amount intended with the aid of the system must be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wished for it, must be available the earliest possible. 
But, if the Conference will have the impression that the program does not fill its function, it has the possibility of blocking the concession of the amount remaining, following two stages: d first 100 billion additional dollars, then, to finish, 350 billion dollars. 
Bush greeted the progress in the negotiations 
although the president can put his veto to this decision, the Conference, it, has the possibility of putting this in minority. 
In spite of these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted in obtaining finances for the purchase from the bad property titles, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not in a position to paying their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be in a position to proceeding Sunday to on vote the law, and the Senate on Monday, "indicated the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
President George Bush is itself happy with by progress in negotiations. 
His spokesperson Tony Fratto declared that Mr. Bush was happy with the progress carried out on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort in order to stabilize our markets financial and protect our economics". 
Limitation of the gilded parachutes 
The president of the banked committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd negotiator chief, said that the legislators have started of agreement on the responsibility of programme financial the protection of the contributing against the losses, the agreement of tax reliefs, the progress of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law plans also to limit the aforementioned parachutes gilded for the managers of the societies participating in the programme and it institutes a committee, which will assure the supervision of the fund. 
The latter should be managed by the ministry of the finances. 
"we have worked very hard on the issue and have made progress important to an agreement that will work and will be efficient for the market and" for all the Americans ", have declared Paulson. 
The plan foresees also aid for the property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages that she is going to purchase, all reducing the instalments of debtors and allowing the latter ones to keep their homes. 
Marek: A psychological help 
From after the economist leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation is going to be very difficult. 
"And that is owed by the way that l 'one ignore what will be the mechanism and the prize of the purchase of the active ones for problems. 
This point will be decisive to contrast with the sharing of the losses between the financial sector and the government ", said Marek, this week, to the server iHNed.cz. 
if the plan will be adopted now, or well at the beginning of next week, is not, according to Marek, not so important that. 
"It is much more important that the congressmans start of agreement, from this week, that they support this plan and that them him consecrat the earliest possible. 
This psychological meaning of the agreement, foreseeing approval of the plan, is important the most at the moment, "underlined Marek. 
A struggle led into the extreme: the readers MP3 against the motives. 
One will advise you, how to choose 
even though almost all mobile know to read files MP3 player, no reader MP3 knows to phone. 
It seems to result clearly that it is worth to buy better a phone uniquely. 
Does not avoid that it exists sufficiently of reasons of obtaining a reader independent. 
The choice entirely depends on the way of use and of the particularities of the future owner. 
Buying an expensive gramophone of top of scale for the house to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc would be absurd. 
Of one hand, such products music do not take out on discs vinyl, and, of in terms of quality, there is not no reason objective, so that happens. 
Yet, if there are piled vinyl disks in your shelves, with of the art rock, of the jazz or of blues music, you dream at least probably of such a gramophone. 
It is similarly music during the movements, that is to say of the compressed music, for the statement in way simplified - of music in MP3. 
There as, are categories depending on the price and quality. 
For the one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way as a fan of the Pink Floyd would have harm to bear the headphones bought for twenty kroner to the market. 
This is two extremes, between which there is enough place for everybody. 
The choice is broad. 
The duration of life of the batteries is also decisive 
Some readers of music top of scale are capable of much more things than of a simple reading music, but it is there a matter of functions unknown, well evidently, of most of the mobile. 
No apparatus current is so universal as the telephone is. 
Beside the functions first, the telephone calls and the sending of SMS, it is capable to read music and the films, of recording the latter, it possesses a camera device of variable quality and can, for example, up to being used to the navigation. 
And if l 'one takes in account the Smartphones and the communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
given that no fridge knows to grill the meat and that no television will take photographs, we attend a miracle. 
Yet the nature universal of the mobile is not without drawbacks. 
the bigger the number of duties that you use is, the space between two reloadings will be seen the reduced. 
And the reading of the music is one of the most important pigs of energy. 
Are rare the motives that are capable of reading music for ten to twelve hours, in most of the cases, this figure is clearly inferior. 
To this consideration the readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are clearly more efficient. 
In the case of mobile cheap, count that they will act music only for a few hours. 
if, besides, it happens to you to call from time to time, you obtain, to be sisters, a second to recharge for the work - this being valid even for appliances more expensive. 
Him problem will not be put itself for the readers MP3, who are capable, subsequent to a reloading, of a continuous working of at least 9 hours including the less powerful. 
Another problem occurs during the recording of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, that a part limited of the aircraft has a connector universal USB, d as much especially that not everyone directly can not be connected to the computer, without a software special. 
one can, evidently, record music directly on the map memory, but few readers of card know to consider themselves it without reduction, being given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the motives. 
In what concerns the readers, you do not need, except exception (iPod), any software. 
Filling, through the connector USB, the device with music coming from the computer suffices. 
Most of the mobile and of the readers are going to create themselves a media library classified of after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, of the style, or then of after the sentence of the user. 
Some appliances display only an index having a structure of tree, to the way of Exploring it from Windows, others are capable of the two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, cowon, the intelligent telephones with operating system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more know-how 
In the choice of a concrete device, you interest especially in the duration of life of the accumulator, at the capacity of the memory, to the quality and to type out of her and, of course, to the ease of the contract. 
if the music is a noise background for you, mainly, and if in the day you are going to listen that for a limited time, for example taking the tram, it suffices to you does not care what motive reading the MP3. 
Almost all mobile are aujourd 'now capable. 
You are not even obliged de trop to mind the formats of music that the mobile or the reader is capable of reading. 
Everyone manage to read the MP3 and the great majority of the music that is going to arrive up to yours will have precisely this format. 
It is part of the most widespread formats and apart from it the vast majority of equipment manages to read also music of format WMA. 
The AAC (format used by the firm Apple and his iPods), as for it, is less running. 
The mobile top of scale allow also, for example, the purchase of music online. 
It suffices to visit, from the portable telephone, the pages web of the operator (or those of another supplier) corresponding and to buy the song or the album in question. 
This service of his alone should constitute a convincing reason of obtaining a mobile musical. 
The offer of the operators is unfortunately poverty-stricken and it confines, in most of the cases, to of the radio tubes in a fast way made. 
Neither the prices are not lowest. 
Nevertheless, one considers generally that this way of buying music (that it is by GSM, internet, indeed by the internet without wireless) will dominate the musical industry in the future. 
Most of the people carry always their motive on itself. 
To every time that you have desire of listening to something, you have only to take out the mobile your pockets, even though you have forgotten your MP3 player at home. 
Yet, it is also important if you have always the headphones on you or well a handsfree with connection. 
if it is not the case, you can use the integrated walls, which possess virtually all mobile, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For a lot the main advantage of mobile music is their prize. 
The less expensive cost less three thousand in a normal way. 
For a prize of three four thousand kroner, one can have an already very suitable walkman. 
Yet, in most of the cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for headphones ordinary. 
The price of better phones and of the better equipped ones, provided also of an entry for headphones ordinary, does not exceed fifteen thousand. 
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having a command easy. 
Really does not care that manages to assure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which do not correspond inevitably to the less expensive (our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command with that of a cassette post, ordinarily used in the past, or of a gramophone, is evident. 
There is not risk of collision under the form of a mobile internet plugged in by chance, followed from a bill of immense data transfer. 
appliance Or to choose 
Even mobile the cheapest (by ex. The Vodafone 527) possess generally a slot for cards memory exchangeable (the type M2, microSD, and so forth). 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand kronor. 
But made careful. 
The models basic support as a rule only cards with a capacity maximum of 2 UK. 
Uniquely the most expensive put through even with cards memory of 8 UK. 
If to possess yourself already a mobile and want still buy a mp3 player cheap walked, take a cowon a creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or well an iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 UK), you must not spend more than 1 kronor. 
if you are part of listeners more demanding, choose rather specialized motives - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These appliances have provided with independent keys of command for MP3, and it is as ease of order approaches that of an MP3 player independent. 
Sony Ericsson, whose the same menu user the motives of the walkman series have as from the readers MP3 sold separately, the one that has gone the furthest in this area is. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of dissertation (up to 16 UK) and a duration of life of the accumulator (in a normal way 15 hours until 35 hours) superiors, is assured by a reader MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned more high. 
A first operator virtual will beat the Czech Republic this ann√©e-m√™me. 
Maybe 
The market mobile in Czech Republic relatively is brought forward, our operators proposing virtually the same services as their partners in Europe of the west. 
In spite of that, we misses it all the same some thing - a potential operator, who would force the operators traditional to lower the prices. 
It can itself that it will not miss during long. 
we have already evoked, repeatedly, the fact that the Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe on Mobil.cz. 
The T√ö (Office Czech of the Telecommunications), who has notified that the price of a SMS was put up more to our places than in the rest of, moreover has confirmed it. 
It is as, with reference to the last steps of the European Commission in the domain of the regulation of the taxes of roaming a situation paradoxical risks to happen - the SMS sent from the foreign country will be for some customers of operators mobile Czech less expensive only 'to the country. 
How it is possible that prices in Czech Republic persist so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, he misses a competition that would wish to enter really to the fight. 
That can seem paradoxical, given that we possess nevertheless three networks mobile and one penetration that exceeds the 100% largely. 
On the contrary the operators mobile love to complain about the market Czech being extremely compete. 
In this, Pavel Dvo√°k, the president of the Advice of the Czech Office of the telecommunications (T√ö), that has declared on several occasions that in Czech Republic there was not place for another operator, made chorus with the operators, anymore. 
It is probably true that apparently a operator classic with its own network does not have anymore much of luck (of elsewhere, at present, it would take on frequencies in an only difficult way). 
Yet, there is still a possibility - a operator virtual. 
It is precisely the entry of the potential operators on the mobile market that has led to a sizeable fall of the prices, which also the classical operators, thereafter, had to react to. 
Nevertheless, even before the entry of the spoilsports such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, of the voice similar to those that l 'one hears aujourd' today ourselves let itself to hear in Great Britain. 
Yet, it has appeared that it remained place for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not of elsewhere not obliged of going to look too far to take on examples. 
At In February we had informed you of the launching, in Poland, of the potential operator Mobilking. 
In six months only, this operator has succeeded in winning more than 100 a thousand customers and to become the fifth operator of the country. 
let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the group financial Penta, who possesses the U:fon between others in Tch√®quie. 
fon in Tch√®quie. The advantage of the potential operators being the possibility of concentrating on a group targets much more concrete. 
so that their operation is efficient, they need indeed much less customers than a classical operator does. 
They are, indeed, exempt to costs of construction, of exploitation and of maintains of the mobile network, relatively high. 
It is as in the world, the operators virtual stand out as operators down cool - they propose calls and messages text good cheap, it that often is counterbalanced by an offer of services limited. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Great Britain SMS at least two times less expensive than its competitors. 
Yet, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows it, to bet on an unusual target group also can constitute a great advertising. 
Indeed, this operator aims in a specific way at the men. 
"The true men choose Mobilking - an operator who pleases them and to whom they can trust", says David Seibert, the CEO of Motive Entertainment Company, exploiting this potential operator. 
It is difficult to statement, if such a concept would be likely to walk also at our places. 
Miroslav epick√Ω, the spokesperson of Vodafone, in doubt: "the market Czech is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which most of the operators virtual is based on. 
Accordingly more that relatively it is saturated with the viewpoint of the offer of the services. " 
In Czech Republic, any luck, suggest the operators mobile 
Nevertheless it seems nearly sure about if a potential operator will be in Czech Republic, it not being Mobilking. 
"We discuss expansion of this project to success, but in Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promoters. 
The launching of Mobilking will have rather place in other countries our area, "says in one maintains telephonic for Mobil.cz Jana Studnikov√°, spokesman for the group financial Penta. 
indirectly it has confirmed thus that operators in Czech Republic were not, in any case, not favorable to this idea. 
On the contrary, they try to make everything their possible so that a potential competitor can not appear. 
The group GTS Will Novate, who would want to overcome thus another step in order to become a real competitor of attracted Telefonika in the domain of the customers, does not hide, for long enough, his intention of throwing a operator mobile virtual. 
"We keep a lot to be in a position to proposing to our customers not only of telecommunications services fixed, but also mobile. 
And the more early will be the best. 
we have already led talks about this possibility on several occasions with the mobile unity of the operators Czech. 
With some, we have succeeded in advancing in the negotiations, "called the spokesperson of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore maybe promising. 
From after non-official information, it seems that maybe we could already receive the first operator virtual from here the end of the year. 
But for the instant its creation is accompanied with a silence total. 
"At the moment, we do not value that a place is on the Czech market for a operator virtual as such. 
The market Czech is in comparison with others very specific. 
For the time being, no subject provided with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us, "has mentioned Vlastimil Srse of the department of press of Telefonika O2, in his declaration for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators rely also on the specificity of the market Czech. 
The spokesperson of T - Motive Martina Kemrov√° asserts in a rare harmony with the declaration of O2: "we have not recorded for the moment viable and bilaterally worthwhile project, which could serve as base." 
And it adds: "virtually it is excluded that a potential operator appears in the network T-Mobile by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of also limited, we should have a concrete agreement from now. " 
Vodafone directs rather its attention on achievement of requests to obtain its own 3G G. 
Miroslav epick√Ω said in relation to that: "We are open to negotiations with potential operators, and especially in the domain of expenses and infrastructure divided. 
It is what, according to us, means the more contributions of from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area being the discovery of partner a to set up network a for a fast mobile internet. " 
The authorities responsible: in phase with operators 
The approach of operators mobile is easily comprehensible, the entry of operators mobile would mean a rise of the competition, would have taken to lower prices and therefore to a reduction of their benefit. 
Why therefore of facilitating the accession of such a competitor? 
while it is a matter of their interests the operators know to hear themselves as thieves in France. The chicane accompanying the creation with the U: fon reveals it also. 
The greatest obvious pressure on the T√ö, during the creation of U: fon, has been that trained by society T-Mobile. 
Reveal it of the information accessible to the public gotten out of pages Web of. 
Yet, aujourd 'Today U: fon lends to serve as an argument not to accept a potential operator. 
Martina Kemrov√° has noticed on that subject: "The competition on the market mobile has lately, furthermore, been amplified by the entry on the market of a fourth operator mobile. 
Considering the character of the market mobile in, it is evident that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially his services, to high particularities. " 
But being given the attitude of the mobile operators that these are, the indifference of bodies regulatory Czechs seems disconcerting. 
It is nevertheless not uniquely a matter of the attitude of the T√ö, which, contrary to Great Britain and to other developed countries, does not have unfortunately the power to intervene in the competition economic, in Czech Republic. 
This belongs exclusively to Office for the protection of the economic competition (√öOHS). 
Yet, the latter adopted, in view of these problems its position typical. 
"The entry of operator virtual on the market mobile a would be possible with reference to the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the potential operator in question regarding the rent of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement of this type has been concluded for the time being, because the offer of the ones interested potential does not have prejudice not presented sufficiently of interest for the operators traditional, "has clarified in response to our question Kristi√°n Chalupa of the department of the exterior relationships of the √öOHS. 
A declaration stated thus would not surprise of operators on behalf of representatives. 
But on behalf of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also to take care, to what nobody takes advantage of his position on the market, such a declaration is more only diverting. 
Of as much more that Kristi√°n Chalupa adds: "at foreign 'l', where the potential operators are in a normal way present, one can notice that their entry on the market has contributed to lower prices services telephone mobile. 
Yet, making pressure in the sense of an honest working of the market and of a drop in prices is apparently not part of the interests of the √öOHS. 
As what is indeed shocks, it is the nearly touching harmony of three operators mobile, which follows from their reactions. 
The question, if it is really there a matter of a chance, lands as a matter of course. 
In the same way, a price of petrol strictly identical to all stations on duty is surement owed by chance and to the battle of the competition. 
"The service has not raised, on that subject, signs of an anticompetitive behavior, it does not have therefore reason of intervening in one way or of another. 
None of the operators has dominant position, consequently none has an increased corresponding responsibility of his behaviour on the market. 
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market to the potential operators are probably even without the regulator of the telecommunications, "has clarified in its statement Waddled. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market constitutes one of many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the markets relevant elaborated by the T√ö, according to which the telecommunications constitute, of the viewpoint of competition economic a single market. 
None of the operators Czech has dominant position on such a market. 
However some experts in the right propose a different vision of things: so that the creation of a potential operator is possible, one must obtain, to every time, the consent of the farmer of network. 
And the mobile operator has logically enough the monopoly on its network. 
It is as he plays necessarily a role predominating in a certain segment of its activities. 
Yet, even without admitting this argumentation, it should be at least worrying for the √öOHS that three operators mobile proceed visibly from way similar. 
Nevertheless the complaints of numerous concerned (including the society GTS Will Novate, already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all the operators of constraints similar. 
To make the responsibility fall on the T√ö is a turn running enough to the communications, by means of which the √öOHS washes his hands of matter to itself. 
we have already met this type of attitude in several cases similar. 
one has not succeeded unfortunately in making to go by in the nov√©lisation of the law on the telecommunications, adopted lately, a broadening of the powers of the T√ö on the domain of the economic competition in the telecommunications, well that many experts promised an improvement of the situation. 
That, the representatives of the √öOHS very well must know it, but their interests are located apparently other. 
While nobody looks, that can work 
That says, the working of a sort of pseudo potential operators, several in the networks mobile Czech remains unnoticed. 
It is a matter of firms publishing their own list of price of prices services telephone mobile, but the latter are public only in part. 
In most of the cases, it is question of firms taking care of the multi level marketing. 
Particularized mobile telephonic services thus are proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and well of other. 
The lists of price of those companies arrive generally only to members of parliament. 
The turn of magic consists in the fact that the firm makes in front of the operator face of a customer started classic, who orders a great quantity of cards SIM. 
As important customer, it obtains offers of price (and other) special. 
What puts problem, it is that business of all operators mobile Czech forbid such a resale. 
"if it happened what you evoke, it could be a matter of an infringement of the contractual conditions that we would examine and who could lead to a stopping of cooperation with the company in question", has replied to our question relative to this problem Martina Kemrov√°. 
Nevertheless, it is little enough probable that echo such activity has not arrived up to the persons in charge of the operators mobile. 
Notably in the case of the three mentioned firms it can be a matter of thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, nevertheless, does not pronounce against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these firms their bring of the non-negligible profits, and, at the same time, in contrast the real potential operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav epick√Ω indicates the possible problems: "Nevertheless the law allows such speculations, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of customers negligible. 
Besides, these are forced to admit that the card SIM in their telephone is not recorded under their name, they can not have it therefore fully, to the mobile way of customers ordinary operators. " 
Yet, it is that precisely that should seem strange to the T√ö. 
Furthermore another question lands at the √öOHS. 
If the operators mobile are turning a blind eye on a such procedure, why they block the creation of a potential operator? 
One must add that the √öOHS has powers fairly broad to be able to unveil such an activity, and if he will not wish to content oneself with the explanations of the operators, who maintain not to have any idea that would happen, their conditions contractual forbidding it. 
when will we not be anymore the country most expensive 
as we have already evoked on several occasions, the entry of potential operators on the market mobile has brought a sizeable fall of in the price of services. 
Yet, virtually in all the countries where appeared of operators virtual, the operators traditional endeavored, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same ones - a too small, indeed too much saturated market, of the problems with the quality of services, etc. 
Yet, it is precisely at this level that are intervened, in the developed countries, the regulating organisms, that defended not the interests of the operators mobile, but those of their customers. 
By formal measures as well as by an informal pressure, they have ended up obtaining the creation from a first potential operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulating organisms treat this question to the way of a warm potato that one disposes of transmitting it to a close target. 
With reference to the experiences that we have, we can not dispose of the impression that the confusion in skills is more them in these cases than beneficial. 
But do not throw the channel after give up so easily. 
if the information of scenes call true and a potential operator will appear soon to our places, the Czech mobile market will recover maybe on the move. 
if one of the operators has accepted the creation of a potential mobile operator, the √öOHS in a difficult way will only be able to remain impassive opposite the rejection (to the discrimination) of others concerned. 
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new anthem Czech has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four works of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the day of the nationality, the Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek presented solemnly the new recordings of the Kde domov mj national anthem (where my homeland) is?). 
The hymn has again been recorded by Orchestra of the Theatre National under direction of. 
We have four versions - with a song solo male or female, an interpretation with and an version instrumental. 
The song is assured by Kateina Kn√≠nkov√° and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremi√°s and Jaroslav Krek are the authors of the arrangements anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Blohl√°vek considers the song national Czech as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
as already it had entrusted beforehand to the esk√Ω rozhlas (the radio public Czech), he has chosen for the interpretation the versions solo of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated. 
"From the beginning, I tried to take care to it that the two singers, as the choir, have a good walking, so that l 'one understand well" the words, which they sing in a simultaneous way, "it has clarified. 
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, next year, his 175√® anniversary. 
The Kde domov mj singing rings for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovsk√© divadlo (the scene of the States) in Fidlovaka (F√™te of the cobblers), Czech original part of Josef Kajet√°n Tyl, accompanied with the music of Frantisek ≈†kroup. 
it has become popular and the people have spontaneously appropriated it. 
After the creation of the Tch√©coslaovaquie in 1918 the first breath became naturally integrating part of the national anthem. 
It was one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.

Public transport in common (MHD) pragois will introduce, Wednesday, the flea in their system ticketing 
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be noted down in the history of the Prask√Ω Dopravn√≠ podnik (the pragoise Agency of the transports) as the date to which will go up to the metro, the streetcars and the buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a ticket in paper, will have an electronic ticket in their pocket. 
At the moment, the latter is accessible for approximately one hundred thousand people, owners of the card smart Opencard. 
The passengers can buy a ticket 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time to make it to record on their card to flea in the points of information and the offices of the Dopravn√≠ podnik (the Agency of the transports), situated in the stations underground Muzeum, Mstek, N√°dra√≠ Holesovice, Andl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° zahrada, Kaerov and Luka. 
From yesterday, there is also the opportunity of buying the tickets by Internet on pages web of the Dopravn√≠ podnik: 
www.dpp.cz. More than four hundred people benefited of service during the morning. 
Those that will start using the shop online can forget in a definitive way the windows in the stations underground, where they owed up to at present to stamp of impatience in long tails with the aim of obtaining tickets in paper. 
Indeed, they will buy their ticket by internet and one will record it on their card Opencard in one of the thirteen Mstsk√° knihovna (municipal libraries). 
"In these points contact, there are the passengers to the available a window with a formed staff, which will help the ones interested with purchase by Internet and, furthermore, will record the ticket that they have bought on their card", said the spokesperson of the project Martin Opatrn√Ω. 
Beside the libraries, recording the electronic tickets on the Opencard in autobanks installed in the hall of several stations underground will be also possible. 
what do these machines look like? 
They are red, remind the machines to stamp the tickets and the passengers already have noticed them maybe in the subway stations Roztyly, Budjovick√°, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk√°. 
'Aujourd' Today, the city has five, but of here the end of the year, eighty should be, "added Opatrn√Ω. 
An automaton will control the ticket instead of the driver 
machines Vending that are going to work from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It suffices to introduce the card to smart Opencard and the ticket bought previously is going to be recorded itself on the map. 
The electronic tickets are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city. 
That is to say in the p√©riurbains trains and the lines of bus 300 to 499, which use mainly the inhabitants of the towns of the central Bohemian to reach the capital. 
"In the trains integrated at Prask√° integrovan√° doprava (transports integrated from Prague), the controllers are equipped with readers of cards, with the aid of which they established the validity temporary and zonal of"; has explained the control of the tickets Filip Dr√°pal of the organization Ropid, which imagines the hours of transport in common pragois. 
The p√©riurbains buses are equipped with readers of card integrated at the checkout of the driver. 
During the boarding it is therefore necessary not only of showing the card to smart the driver, but it is needed to put also the Opencard to the place indicated on the side of the checkout. 
It is as the driver controls the validity of the recorded tickets. 
"if the passenger would need to verify the validity of the recorded tickets, there is not anything simpler of asking to the driver for such information," completed Dr√°pal. 
The passengers who do not take the p√©riurbains buses and will not remember the date that the validity of their ticket exhales, can join again the autobanks, initially used to record the tickets on the map. 
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information are going to be displayed regarding the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten asked for a referendum in the USA 
The Germans Sudeten asked in 1945 to what ≈†umava is integrated in the United States. 
That follows from a letter put down in the collections of the Jihoesk√° vdeck√° knihovna (The scientific Library of the Bohemian of the south). 
if we can not be part from Germany or from Austria, we want to live at least under the employers on United States of America. 
In 1945, some groups of Germans of Sudeten appealed allegedly to the president of the USA with such a desire. 
That follows between other of a letter protected in one archives private, which is aujourd 'hui put down in the collections of the Jihoesk√° vdeck√° knihovna. 
Of the Germans of esk√Ω Krumlov pray in the letter the American president of not allowing that "sumavsk√° upa" (region of forests to the south of the Bohemian) - annexed by Hitler in accordance with agreement of Munich - is given back in Czechoslovakia. 
"well we have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the proclaiming words that the American troops come on the territory German not in oppressive and hostile, but in liberators", is written in the letter, "signed" people, "from which the fate of the ≈†umava stems seriously". 
given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promiser - experiencing the Czech national character - only of brutality, of without respect, of incomprehension, of oppression and of servitude, the authors of the letter pray the American president of taking the protectorate of the ≈†umava for now in his hands and forever. 
"we can not believe, that you would grant this territory to a foreign State of ours, that oppresses and who destroys the minorities and who does not have in anything contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking in account the opinion of the quarter of a million" of the inhabitants ", is written in the letter. 
The alleged reason why the perpetrators can not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors". 
if the president of USA doubted the opinion of the Germans of ≈†umava, it would have only to organize a referendum in the region, according to the authors of the letter, to establish if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or to live well under the employers on United States. 
Well that the text contained in the letter can, considering the present knowledge of the history of the post-war period, to seem about somewhat na√Øve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the waiting of the Germans of Sudeten of time. 
even though the Germans Czechs owed everything at least to anticipate that the question of their expulsion of the republic will land, very little among them were confessed itself such a possibility. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain were going to obtain for the Sudeten a certain type from autonomy. 
Others believed that they would quite simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born to esk√© Budjovice, confirms it. 
During the war, this was, as German of esk√© Budjovice, engaged in the navy in the countries Baltic. 
while 'at the end of the war, it was captured by the English and put in the camp of capture of the region Holstein, tens of Germans Czechs came to consult it so that it teaches them the Czech. 
"They believed that a time back at their places, the Czech would be them beneficial", said Chalupa. 
None of the captured Germans that lived in Czechoslovakia before the war considered, according to it, that, with reference to the decrees, it would be expelled of the republic. 
Reflect - pay! 
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers 
The action aiming the most expensive road safety in the Czech history. 
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that to the intention of throwing, Wednesday the Ministry of Transport. 
The service of's minister eb√≠ek think that it is going to discourage the drivers from a dangerous behavior to at the wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, at the radio, at the cinema, on internet, but also on the tracts. 
it should discourage the drivers from driving fast and from the alcohol at the steering wheel. 
But also reminding them to take the belt before starting up. 
She wants to touch especially the conscience of the conductive youths, of the motorcyclists, of the pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
Especially personal histories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Also the slogan "girthing" of the whole campaign reveals it: 
Reflect - pay! 
The phrase "you do not reflect" is noted down in icann-approved named on the plate registration. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "you will pay". 
It that must symbolize that l 'one can pay of the life a moment see. 
The spots are going "to haunt" the spectators up to in 2010. 
The ministry analogous campaigns has inspired in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where l 'one can see commonly of the pictures with drastic pictures of drastic victims of accidents. 
He considers that will lead to a fall of the rate of accidents and of the number of dead persons on the Czech roads. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and of the whip against the drivers 
"What walks with the drivers, it is the system of sugar and of the whip. 
For them the sugar is represented, for example, with the fact of gaining the time, while they grill a red light. 
The whip, it is the threat of a fine or of an accident. 
The risks must be reminded to the drivers, "said Martin Ko√°n, the psychologist of the transports of the hospital Na Homolce. 
It is as we need campaigns of information in the press and especially from of advertisements negative, values the psychologist. 
The signs signaling the danger to the drivers are, according to it, already less efficient. 
"While a static sign that warns against a danger is installed, in a fast way it is going to merge probably with the environment and the drivers will not remark it more," signaled Ko√°n. 
Olmert would give back in return for the peace almost all the territories occupied 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the government provisional Israel, pronounced in favour of the return virtually of all the territories occupied in 1967, including therefore the West Bank, Jerusalem - East and the heights of the Golan, in return for the peace with the Palestine and Syria. 
It made this declaration in a published interview Monday through the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"we must lead to an agreement with the Palestinians, what means that giving back nearly all the territories (occupied), indeed everyone will be necessary", says Olmert at on daily basis. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give up to the Palestinians a percentage similar (of territory Israeli), since without that, the peace will not be made," it added. 
He admitted that the possible return would include Jerusalem - East. 
"The one that wants the safety in Jerusalem, and especially do not want only tractors and bulldozers run over the feet it, as that has happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce parts of Jerusalem," noticed Olmert referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, during which several people were killed and of the tens of hurt people. 
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a solution special for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places "situated to the inside of old city. 
"The one that will want to maintain the sovereignty Israeli on throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
That will not work, "it underlined thereafter. 
Reprocess of Golan the Heights 
Olmert pronounced itself also in favour of the retirement of Israel of the heights of the Golan, what constitutes, according to it a prerequisite with a view to the conclusion of an agreement of peace with Syria. 
Yet, that would require also some efforts on behalf of Damascus. 
"I do not offer to conclude the peace with Syria uniquely on the basis of pension from the Golan Heights", it signaled. 
"The Syriens know very well what they are going to have to renounce to obtain the Golan. 
they are going to have to renounce their relations current with Iran; they are going to have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (movement Shiite); they are going to have to renounce to the supports constant that they match to the terrorism of the Hamas (movement Shiite), of the Al-Ka√Øda (terrorist network), as of that of the Djihad (holy war) in Iraq, "clarified prime minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: The cabin in the because they are illegal? 
The law ignores them; walking in one because long distance is forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the society Student Agency close to Padua, in Italy, arises the question if the comfort and the passengers can during the journey to move to the inside of the bus. 
"If l 'one wanted to respect the law in a strict way and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on traffic suggests the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which a receptionist aged of 22 years has perished, apparently has been caused by the driver of a truck that has crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was at this time foundation beside the driver, on the seat most dangerous of the vehicle, unfortunately although it has two other seats to its disposal. 
Yet, the bus can have an accident, indeed brake in a brusque way, also at the moment that the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers. 
What is important, it is if the bus is technical in accordance with his card equipped with seats standing or not. 
If this equipment for places standing is not ratified, the passengers must remain sat. 
The buses long distance Student Agency do not arrange of places standing; what has been confirmed to Aktu√°ln.cz by the manager of the firm Radim Janura. 
"It is" a question "that we have dealt with the ministry and, initially, it forbids any movement of passengers a question. 
Then they have canceled it and we have obtained that the passengers can go to toilets during the journey provided that they have their own seat, "he has unveiled his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is not univocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is occupied of it role. 
Of somewhere else, no legal prescription forbids either to the carrier to propose services. 
The law on transport road experiences uniquely the term of recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and his duties ", adds with more of ambig√ºit√© the spokesperson Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorn√Ω, the manager of the department of the movement of vehicles road, considers, on the contrary, that the law treats the problem sufficiently. 
"Everything depends on the fact if the bus has in its approval the permission of proposing places standing. 
Everything resides inside, "it says. 
The buses are divided in urban, where there are places standing and a limited maximal speed, interurban with places standing and speed allowed higher and coaches long-distance outdistances without place standing with the maximal speed authorized the highest and of the seats equipped with seat belts. 
As in the airplane, suggests an expert 
Jaroslav Ho√≠n, expert at BESIP (security of the traffic) in safely in transport, does not see the moving from of comfort on board as a problem major. 
"During a regular circulation, there is not danger. The situation can be compared with that of the service in the aircraft. 
There neither, it is not sure when be fallout will happen and the receptionist of the air can bang herself your head. 
"Yet, in the case where the bus would have braked of brusque way the laws of physics would be evidently valid. 
In the same way that in a bus city or in a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by regulations internal, "it says and values also that of the point of view of the law, the problem are not ordered. 
Janura is ready to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier bus to propose the services of comfort. 
He hires It two a hundred. 
Even after this incident the director does not consider their profession as a Profession at risk. 
"Nevertheless, as soon as I will have the impression that it is a matter of a profession at risk, I will remove it. 
The passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding. 
That would reduce the costs, "it says. 
The concern is the reason that gives to the absence of stewards in its vehicles the manager of the Asiana Alexe√Ø Litvine, who assures, in comparison with HER, a very reduced number of lines. 
"We do not have receptionists. We oppose it from the beginning. 
Sooner or later that will finish by a fatal accident, "it has said, it is one years, to T√Ωden.cz. 
A huge tragedy has happened 
A young receptionist of the region of Plze, who worked for the society for two years, has perished during the accident on line of Naples. 
A lorry Slovenian has quit√© the gang of ruling emergency probably without using of blinker and it has blocked the path to the bus. 
The driver of it last to try to avoid it by means of a maneuver rushes, but it has brushed against it by his side right. 
Janura refuses that the two seats reserved to the rest of the cabin have been sold. 
"In the case of lines long distance, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked." 
The firm intends to lodge a complaint against the driver of the lorry. 
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in what concerns the financial compensation, she counts also on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A change in the law, that is at being elaborated, for more than one year, by a group of thirty experts of the Department of Transportation, could bring precision as for the movements from of comfort on board bus. 
"Yet, it has not led to any conclusion on this point. 
To tell the truth, it is not interested too much in the buses, but it rather to the system of points, to the maximal speed on the motorway and to the use of mobile at the wheel, "calls the expert Ho√≠n. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider safety of passengers the activity of the stewards as a thing that would put fundamentally in endanger," concludes the spokesperson Hanzelka, clarifying that the control of the safety of the buses is under the power of security police and of the service for the safety at work. 
The hopes of rest on Frankfurt. 
The big words did not miss in the letter addressed by the executive committee of the WestLB to the employees of the house. 
Throughout a union of the entities of the financial institute of D√ºsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the stock markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could constitute itself, according to the mail made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a doubled "block of ability" of a lasting productivity in such a business. 
All in all, such a relationship could be the kick-off decisive to other concentrations in the sector of the banks of the L√§nder. 
Veiled to which that looks while a Committee executive board insists on demonstrating his capacity of action in difficult times. 
because the WestLB, hurt, always undergoes a pressure. 
It is not only the Commission European, but also the federal Authority of Surveillance of the Financial Services that has, that only lately, clearly made understand to the government of the Land of Rhenanie du Nord-Westfalie that the time was counted in the research of a future solution. 
It is though question for some time already - also of the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of an indifferent form between the bank Deka, that connait the customers of the Sparkasse throughout their funds, and the WestLB. 
Indeed the leader of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas has made announced at the presentation of the figures of six months thin August that he did not see any sense in the fusion of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, which it is the Helaba or the WestLB. 
However the advice of administration of the Deka, of which each half is borne and by the banks of the L√§nder and by the groups of crates of savings, has assigned to the executive committee to drive talks with the WestLB with a view to common commercial activities. 
it could be then a matter of the debit of the stock market, or of parts of this. 
The talks only have just begun however, one calls in the centre financial. 
It is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, who, with its 3,000 employees, counts most important employers for the one on the financial place of Frankfurt, goes at stake lorqu 'it is question of strengthening of the sector of building savings. 
In 2003 one has believed for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the land of Rhineland sun and the Halbab. 
Nothing has nevertheless emerged from this compound bunch. 
Hardly the plans had them been made public that the government of the land of Hesse pronounced against every participation of the Hellaba in these. 
Thereafter the two other houses neither not him rejoign√®rent not. 
The bank of the Land of Rhineland sun has been connected instead to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there have been new negotiations on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks of L√§nder always. 
Lastly, G√ºnther Merl, president of the executive committee of the Hellaba, had however pronounced itself against every commercial strategy of merger with its bank. 
Independently of that, the feeling seems to spread that the grouping of the various institutions of sector public is particularly urgent. 
Maintaining that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria is past, a union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could materialize in all first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure that obliges to new mergers had to increase the potential partners go beyond it gradually. 
In the South, it would be henceforth a junior partner, although it has hitherto better resisted the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The group of the crates of savings and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, who possesses 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has on the other hand pulled a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB. 
Would remain at the outside the NordLB. 
Such thinking geo-strategic reflects however only one of the facets. 
Another facet asks the question of knowing what way the different commercial models of each of these banks can supply themselves with. 
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, that is to say thanks to what model business the future capacity of banks should be assured, hitherto had not been solved by the German group of the crates of savings and transfers. 
Eventually a carve-up of the WestLB could take place, carve-up that here is not wished evidently. 
It is also of that of which it is question in the letter of the executive board committee in place: in any case, a ` global solution 'for the establishment would be aimed at. 
in what way all that will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains still to see. 
The second weekend of the celebration of beer also is known as the weekend of the Italian ones. 
For Elena, it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies it as girlfriend, and therefore nothing is similar, it says. 
Behind them, close to a barrel of five liters of beer of the brand Emperor Kaiser, stands a well built bearded man that shows to around 200 visitors of the party of the beer what sounds profound his throat can produce. 
Elena slap of surroundings Luca then embrace. 
From Bologne, they have come up to Verona. 
From there, of the haulage depot close to the Puorta nueva station, four buses take tonight's departure from 11.45 p.m., ` destinazione Monaco, festa della birra, 'arrival foreseen to 6h30. 
Three buses are reserved above all for the Italian ones, in one of the buses travel by the br√©silens exclusively. 
In a corner of the car park, the sud-am√©ricains ones sing of already and already beside their flag, already they have celebrated the last night. 
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italian ones. 
The buses belong to Marco, which carries a long coat doubled from false fur and from the glasses to large pairs silver eels. 
For five years, they go to the celebration of the beer, already three drives nothing that this year. 
They go there by night, remain the day the festival, and fit at 10.30 p.m.. 
To go by the night would imply unnecessary costs, explains Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the container of welcome with a Emperor Kaiser beer, mixed in accordance with the law of purity Bavarian, the health insurance assurance and a person in charge of the group speaking German - Marco has made a lesson of language in Frankfurt. 
And already the buses roll in the night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'. 
There is not beer, not yet. 
Rapidly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, the travellers sleep. 
It is better thus, they will have still need their forces. 
The breaks will be made to Bressanone, and at Holzkirchen, while a great one numbers other buses with plates vehicle number-plates Italian make again once a break little before Munich, on the motorway 8. 
While at the morning, the group of Marco arrives finally at six hours 30 as expected on the car park close to the place Th√©r√®se, close to 50 other buses across Europe are already there. 
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco keeps one last speech, explains the plan of attack. 
First: putting the small hat yellow on itself. 
Dessus is written on the left ` Party of the beer ¬¥, in Gothic, and nearby addresses it internet of the agency of journey of Marco "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Second: ` While the doors of the tent beer are embroidered, one hunts ¬¥, cries Marco in the morning. 
` Running! 'Roaming and reserving the places at the bottom of tents. 
'Not in front, otherwise one blocks, and not all hats yellow on the same quarters, they must be distributed in the room! 
The tankard, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros. 
And do not forget the instruction! 
` Showing the agents of security that we behave well! 
as soon as you leave your places, they have left '! 
Third: ` to have come back, tonight, here has ten hours and half pulls up ¬¥! 
'Included? And that is to it, it has left to the celebration from the beer. 
On the way, quelqu 'one ties of hats yellow the trees to find the path, to the signs and even to an poster election a large Party People's Bavarian. 
One insists on being ready for the return. 
It is the second weekend of the celebration of beer, known as the ` weekend of the Italian ones'. 
There are not precise numbers; one talks about 50 000 that put en route across the Alps and collapse in the newsstand to beer, 10 percent of visitors are come on purpose of Italy this weekend. 
The munichoise police are reinforced by seven policemen of the Tirol du Sud, by Italian voluntary rescuers who support the bavaroise red cross that realizes a statistic on the country where the Italian ones occupy the first place in front of the British ones (60 speeches) and the Austrian ones (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
That that particularly is appreciated of the Italian ones, it is the tent of the brewery. 
Nights of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banked system is relatively stable, insisted the minister federal finance a few weeks ago only. 
what luck that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that it slipped that the sector banking German would not be saved by movements of crisis. 
This has indeed appeared this weekend. 
The financier of the bavarois one property Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side to the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of a billion to protect itself from the turbulence of in markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the credits of help are freed up to an amount from 35 billion euros. 
The hypo Real Estate henceforth should pay interests on the fraction to the what it would have thus right. 
The money comes as many private banks as banks of public law. 
In background, it is the society - girl Depfa that bears the losses. 
The financier of sec state 'was, according to a article newspaper, refinanced to very short term for projects in the long term for which it had borrowed of the money - it that is not no more possible for because of mistrust towards the markets. 
At The first half 2008, the reserve of liquidities of the bank had been reduced of 95 percent to 2,37 millions euros, the rate equity capital also lightly had weakened of 1,6 to 1,45 percent. 
The profits current and those net coming of financial transactions were, in relation to the same period the previous year, fallen to on ground zero, the profits coming from the attribution of debts and of determined movable values as the termination of supplies in the operations of credit had fallen furthermore of 70 percent at 5 million euros. 
And it is only thanks to the important profits gotten out of the repayment of accounting downhill coming from the restructuring of former group Depfa, as of the repayment of the interests according to the book of the fiscal procedures and of the commercial purchases for the firms of Konzern that the deficit of gains nearly 16 percent has proved to be moderated. 
After its privatisation in 1990 ', financial old' l 'of state had everything of surroundings badly speculated on industrial property credits, that afterwards had been finalized to the bank Aareal. 
Because what the financing of state classic was not profitable enough, the Depfa afterwards had started more intensely in the projects of infrastructure and in the financing of projects in common between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the society - girl, the Hypo Real Estate must conduct redemptions that should have of gains and losses of the group on the calculation an essential material effect that nevertheless remains enough blurred. 
The fact is that the dividends have amputated. 
Already for 2007, they have shortened to the two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, for the purchase of the Depfa, a highly important investor of state and of infrastructures. 
It is more solid than from other institutes dependent on the refinancing on the inter-banked market puisqu 'it does not possess no Depot customers. 
With the bankruptcy of the bank of investment Lehman Brothers there are two weeks, allocation of credit between banks considerably is dried up itself again, the banks having amassed their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the unity of the credits of the Depfa of a means in the short term of refinancing. 
From after a communiqu√© of the Hypo Real Estate, the need of financing of the group is covered with the credit to medium term and the firm protected from influence of markets international financial largely out of state of running presently. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be sure thanks to the funds until end 2009. 
The president of the executive board committee of HRE Georg Funke explained on the other hand that the group Hypo Real Estate no more should have to resort to the markets financial in medium term in the medium term. 
The federal Bank and the federal Establishment for the Surveillance of the Financial Services (Bafin) leave from the principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is henceforth sure. 
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have more only to hope for it. 
However, considering the momentum and of the imponderability of the crisis, there is not no certainty. 
It is not of elsewhere not unthinkable that one must resort to the financing in all its breadth. 
But the opposite neither can not be discarded. 
After the fact that the bank is still, of after the releases, insolvency to the doors Sunday in end of the evening this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in reassuring the minds neither. 
The lesson of the sec action 'collapses of 75 percent to 3,30 euros. 
The prices of obligations, on the other hand, are worn particularly well. 
Even though the debts in the first head have hardly moved, the lessons of loans second plan weaken. 
The most touched are especially the funds of investment of the old society - girl W√ºrttemberg Hypo and those of course that have a duration of life beyond 2009.

Sylvana and the secrets of limps it to Bento 
while Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must appear for the first day to the Highschool of Tachibana, the girls start pouffer of laughing: the German one is so many "kawaii"! 
That east - it - that means? 
Sylvana connait already this word thanks to the Mangas - in his new Log of exchanges, she talks about of Japan. 
"The first day of lesson in Japan. 
That east - it - that I was excited. 
Already the path to go to the school made me afraid. 
I live in periphery of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes up to the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have of the to find the road everything alone, fortunately I have not lost. 
The beginning of the courts do not seem to be set in so strict in Lower Saxony as at our places. 
The students appear ones after the others from eight hours, up to what at nine hours least 20, a round table discussion begins with the teacher, the "home room". 
But before the course begins, appearing be up to me. 
I am not at all of the kind to love to talk in front about the people, particularly in front of a class of 40 pupils. 
as I did not have the uniform of the school yet, I have put an old skirt of My mother, as a shirt, of the blue rising socks and of shoes leather black. 
In this place therefore, I have appeared in front of the rostrum, and have tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I am called Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that moment, I was very happy of having started learning the language him there well two years. 
The 31 girls of the class have everyone fact of the low masses, pouff√© of laughing and made of the signs, and constantly I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew it already thanks to my mangas. 
It belongs to the essential vocabulary to the survival of the Japanese adolescents and means "darling, cabbage". 
Afterwards I have rapidly sneaked at my place. 
The girl beside me has made me a great smile ironic, she thought that it was an honour that the correspondent must sit beside it. 
The rest of moment has been quiet enough, but while the gong has resonated, I have been attacked in the rules. 
Everybody spoke to whom better, pouffait of laughing and asked many questions to me - in that case, it is difficult enough to understand the Japanese English. 
During the summer, everyone have gone out then their Bento. 
My mother of m reception 'also had made this kind of Lunchbox - it is really other thing that the miserable snacks German. 
I had from the rice to the herbs aromatic, of small sausages, a salad of cucumber and of algae, fruit and a sort of meat surrounded with Tofu. 
Most of the time, I do not have any idea of what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
The things have a seemingly bizarre and a completely new taste. 
What is sure, it is that everything is really good. 
Good, except maybe the conserved salty plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not of lunches only in the Japanese schools. 
It happens sometimes that a girl offers a boy a Bento qu 'it has prepared itself, and who is then prepared particularly tidily - in the hope to be able to meet knowledge of the boy during summer a bit better. 
I have read that in my mangas. 
I am curious to know as I could observe it as here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends have asked for me while I have told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo. 
I have then always replied: 
"Because that fascinates me, which" 
To read, after all, mangas, it is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at a moment, I have also started learning the Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel one day. 
because I also have a weak one as the traditions, the ways and the customs. 
And here, one gives them a lot of importance. 
Of one side, Japan is the country of technologies and of the most recent tendencies - of the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the greatest city that I have never seen. " 
Rats also have their sensations 
A rat or a cold turkey escapes in the face of the danger, east - it - that means that it feels also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced of it: many animals have also sensations. 
But how could one check that it feels the same thing while it behaves in the same way as we? 
In the online magazine "Edge" the contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
Present SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of articles of the replies to the question "that you intend to be true without being able to have the proof? 
I believe that the animals have the sensations and other states of conscience without me or does not care that of other does not have until now been able to prove it all as one can not prove that the other beings human have a conscience. 
But in that case - there, at least one can hope that all the brain human present the same configuration. 
as soon as we turn to other species and that we approach the questions of the felt one or in general of the conscience, we come to grounds in a difficult way practicable because the Hardware does not correspond. 
while a rat is in the face of a danger, it makes the same thing that many other animals: it is the death, runs away or attacks. 
Human beings behave in the same way, it is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience. 
Though, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain give back the transposition of our difficult subjective experience at that of animals. 
One of the aspects is that the circuits associated nearly always with the human conscience include the prefrontal side Cortex (because of his participation in the memory short-term and in the duties of management and of execution). 
This vast region much more is developed by the human beings than by the other primates and seems to be entirely absent by other people. 
All the less therefore for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the conscience of whom we are, and the capacity for foreseeing and for deciding, it is reasonable to require that the human being differs even from the other primates. 
Another feature significant could reside in the linguistic nature of the Man: as a large part of its existence is related to the language, that means often that its conscience depends on it. 
In that case, one could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience did not have to depend on the language, this would influence it surely, so that the animal conscience, whatever is the way in which it is produced, would differ from most of our states of conscience probably much. 
It is for that it is as difficult to determine that the conscience can look like among other animals. 
If that, internal and subjective, does not let itself nor to measure nor, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze basing experience on our own itself, then his observation puts serious problems to us. 
Most of my developments make reference to the content of the experienced aware, but there is another aspect of the conscience that should be more easily accessible scientifically nearby. 
one could examine the processes of conscience of the animals without taking into account their content, and it is exactly what has happened during studies on the memory in the short term of the primates, particularly with example of display. 
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have followed, one concentrates more on the correlations nervous awareness than on the causals mechanisms: the two can be identical or not. 
Strangely this approach also underlines the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in achieving the display. 
But what it results from it then for the emotions? 
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of the fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are while the activity of the defense mechanism localized in the brain (or his continuations, as the reactions of the body) monopolizes of the memory alive. 
Thus observed the emotions are narrowly related to the regions of the cortex that characterize the primates and very particularly the Man. 
Of subtle degrees of the felt one, associated with our voluble nature, free, because we can, with the help of words and of the grammar, to differ and to categorize states to impute them to others than to us even. 
To the opposite, Antonio Damasio for example thinks that the sensations coming from activities primitive are born in the regions of the corporal sensation of the Cortex and of the waistline strokes, everything as Jaak Pankseep that concentrates though on the waistline strokes more. 
as this network has much not been altered in the course of the human evolution, it would be able totally participated of sensations horizontal in any kind. 
Of A point of view purely theoretical, I can not contradict it, but I believe that undemonstrable. 
Pankseep argue of the fact that what appears as fear by the Men and among the rats is likely as felt as such an in the two cases: how could one nevertheless verify if the rats and the Men feel the same thing while they behave in a similar way? 
A cold turkey escapes in the face of the danger, but if it feels fear? 
At my eyes behaviour similar does not suffice to prove experienced identical. 
Indeed the comparison nervous helps: the rats and the Men possess similar cerebral trunks, the depressions on the other hand do not possess even a brain. 
But east - it - that the waistline strokes is to the origin of these sensations? 
And even if one could prove that for the Man: how could one demonstrate it among the rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, maybe even the depressions (that knows?) have of sensations. 
But I would not know how to demonstrate it. 
And because their sensations differ likely from ours (since the consciousness Human rests on channels special and on the language) completely, I prefer to explore the behaviour emotional that the emotional sensations of the rats. 
In all cases, progress breaks on the nervous plan in the measure where l 'one gauge the same thing among the rats and by the Man. 
as I do not explore the language and the conscience among the rats, or the sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
one could judge that as of the in the short term, but I prefer rather to advance that of banging oneself with a wall constantly. 
I am indeed a pragmatic √©motionel. 
Platini president of Uefa: a deadline of grace for Poland and Ukraine 
The Prime Minister assigned Iwan Wasjunik has explained that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of the president and of the Prime Minister. 
"The government considers the decision of UEFA to Bordeaux as a sign in trust in Ukraine and in his capacity for organizing, in collaboration with Poland the championships European", announced Wasjunik. 
"but it is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work has just begun, and it is still much to make in the two countries. 
In the calendar of the building or of the destruction of the stadiums, of the streets, of the hotels and of the airports the two hosts run after the deadline. 
The number of stadiums for the championship Europe possibly could be reduced of eight to six. 
"we can not lose time anymore. 
we must work on the speed maximal ", declared the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA has us constantly at the eye". 
action Even tougher has been decided in Poland. 
The direction of the League of football Polish PZPN has been suspended by the Committee Olympic National after numerous scandals and replaced with Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The committee was gathered on the request for of the Minister Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There would be "a true danger that the PZPN is not capable of acting in the rules", declared Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP. 
"we have assured to the president of Uefa in a letter that the preparations of the European Championship of 2012 would not suffer from it. 
Several members of the league of First Division have been, already in the season previous, sentenced for handling of file compulsory; 
Dennis Quaid incensed counterattack 
She wanted to make of the promotion for a new film, has talked about his life deprived in an interview - and has now trouble with her ex: the hollywoodienne star Meg Ryan has raised the veil on her ex adulterine Dennis Quaid. 
It foams - and counter-attack. 
A war of the late Rose for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after divorce the two actors Hollywood give themselves to an ugly battle - with knowledge of everybody. 
Last week Meg Ryan had expressed herself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has been me during long unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
she would have read about the area of cheating only after the divorce. 
The reason of this striptease of the thought resides in the relationships of press of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - is told the history of an adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his qualification of husband unfaithful fell clearly: it "would be" Monstrous ", said this to the" New York Daily News ", 54 years, that" Meg ruminates a new time the history of our relationship and manipulates it ". 
It would be of more "regrettable", that "the grief and the upheaval that comprise a divorce for each child again are revived in public" for their son common 16 years Jack. " 
even though Ryan lives alone for the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will become soon the father of twins. 
Thus was his reply to the gentle: "In any case my life continues. 
I value me happy to have a wonderful family that goes at best ". 
The prices of tickets and of the hotels fall 
In the first half of 2008, the flights and the nights of hotels were less expensive than the previous year was. 
In Germany, according to a study current, the flights even would be reduced jusqu 'has 50 percent. 
The flights and the nights of hotel would have become worthwhile - it is the result of a study of the recipient of financial services and of Travel American Express. 
The firm has analyzed his data of reservations of the first half of 2008 and has established, after a rise of the prices in the first term, a net fall of the profits in the second term. 
after the prices on the market of the hotels have increased for the years the nights hotels have already reduced to many places. 
From January to March, the prices increased in 41 in the 48 European cities examined still of 6,9 percent on average in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 examined European cities. 
From April to June, the prices were already however 3,6 percent lower ones than the previous year. 
The trend has been net especially to Paris and to Rome, where the travellers owed paid of 30 to 37 percent less than a year more early. 
The causes of all that would reside for American Express in the weak lesson of the dollar that has driven tourists Americans to a desire to travel on the decline ". 
The financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be similarly more affected by the retreat of the price of hotels than the industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the town Swedish the price of hotels are had with an increase from 26,3 percent the record in Europe. 
Also as regards price of flights the trend was to the rise in the first term: 
Because of the increase of rising price of kerosene passengers in class economy have of the to pay on average 7,1 percent of more than in 2007, the flights long-haul, very consumers of fuel, even have increased up to 29,2 percent. 
From April to June, the prices of the tickets in class economy have fallen on average of 12,5 percent in comparison with the previous term, in class bustles about and in first class however, the variations price largely less have been pronounced. 
In Germany, the prices have experienced a fall even more important than in other countries European: 
From January to March, the prices had increased in 11,9 percent, in the second term, they have fallen of 23,6 percent. 
The German interior flights have even divided by two according to this study. 
The reasons of this fall in prices would be of a side a weakening economic growth, explains the firm. 
The c√®derait request for the ground in much of segment of the market of travel by plane. 
From the other hand, there would be a marked pressure of the competition throughout the treaty "Opened sky" that liberalizes traffic air between the United States and Europe. 
Sign the situation tense is the suppression by the airlines of journeys, as the high number of airlines that would have put down the assessment for the first half 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing that in Europe. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first of the classification. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has not succeeded always to take on one eleven functional. 
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarging. Landing in disaster for player international Marko Marin. 
The player of Gladbach came back only late to the game and his raised shooting failed against tallies it of purpose. 
His message was precisely stated, it had gone out from his lips in a persuasive way. 
He quite simply knew that he was right. 
"We need this second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the locker rooms of the arena of Hamburg. 
He did not pass little to itself in the changing rooms, the half-time was finished and the majority had sat down itself to their place. 
Rieger has been for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as well of previous protagonists. 
And it is why his application has been received to at places strategic. 
The entraineur helping Cornelius Jol has acquies√© and has raised the push to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the entraineur in leader of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and that jumps with this second goal! 
The implementation has missed. 
"Everything was not very beautiful to see aujourd" today, confessed later to Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would have "wished to be also more released". 
It 1:0 (1:0 to the half-time), the team of Hamburg owes it to a touch of the head succeeded at by Mladen Petric (at the eleventh minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not make harm to the weak players of Hamburg. 
"That has been a dirty victory", summarized Marin Jol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrated themselves, the sky blue above and the pictures of provisional classification on the gigantic screen that indicated their club as first of the class. 
There is going to be an anniversary without real celebration. 
"We know to take hindsight", said Marcell Jansen. 
He suspects that the result of the table reflects more the nature unpredictable of the Premier League than the domination of his HSV. 
The team with his lately committed newcomers - the Brasilian ones Neves and Silva, the Guardian purpose Petric everything as Jansen of the FC Bayern laid off - forms indeed sweetly, but it does not sparkle yet. 
"We need more charm and more dribbles," required Jol.

From The on dark influence the flight of probes space 
For years a mysterious phenomenon leaves the researchers in the confusion: from the on dark influence the speed of probes space during what one calls the maneuvers of gravitational support. 
The experts fear that the theory general of relativity is not completely correct. 
Nearly for almost 18, the space probe "Ulysses" flies to the space. 
Because of soon cold conductions of fuel, the cryog√®ne death threatens it. 
For years a mysterious phenomenon is cause of distress among the researchers - the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
The gravitational support is a maneuver of the space probes, by which they obtain an additional boost in the gravitational field from a body heavenly the Earth by example. 
Thus, the probes can save much from fuel. 
The am√©rico-europ√©enne probe of research Cassini-Huygens used this physical astuteness, all as the solar probe Ulysses. 
It is what surprises the researchers of elsewhere for years: the flying objects do not perform always to 100 percent of the way in which one waits for it according to the venerable ones laws of gravity. 
Well more, irregularities appear as regards the speed. 
The probes become faster or slower unexpected way. 
until now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They called it the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relativity of Albert Einstein, who describes the strength of attraction of the matter because of the curvature area, can not be entirely correct. 
The physicist American Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes always hard as iron that Einstein did not make a mistake and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational support with the aid of it that one calls the matters black that the astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"The matters black could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also close to the Earth," written - him. 
Researchers from area know about the matters black only for about ten years. 
It emanates apparently of it a strength of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies. 
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, it is - to say that it does not send nor does not reflect no radiation electromagnetic especially any light visible. 
Of after the calculations of the scientists, the black matter would represent all the same a good fifth of the mass entire of universe. 
The tourists taken away in Egypt are free 
After ten days at in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be freed as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed it. 
The kidnappers Sudanese had required a ransom of several million euros.

The German ones are constantly in the sights of kidnappers. 
WELT ONLINE depicts the cases most important. 
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free. 
It is it that have gave together the Egyptian television of state, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media. 
The Italian Minister of the Franco Foreign Businesses Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed. 
we are verifying their state of health ", told Frattini. 
The five German, the five Italian and the Rumanian one as their eight guides Egyptian feel well and are in safe, announced the Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants of trip in desert should already be on the way to the Cairo. 
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of the hostages remain still blurred: thus, the kidnappers would have been to put a term to the kidnapping, according to the statements of an agent of security Egyptian, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without crying station. 
"The problem was resolved. 
They were of agreed with a ransom ", declared the agent. 
It did not remain left than to gather the hostages ", while suddenly", this surprised "sec is produced. 
soldiers Sudanese had destroyed this Sunday six of the kidnappers in the frontier zone between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had stopped two among them. 
The takers of hostage had required a ransom of an amount of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be replaced by the German woman of one of the hostages. 
The daily "El Masri El Jom" declared that, according to the statements of a German mediator the release of the hostages fell behind because the kidnappers feared for their safety. 
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free the hostages feminine after the payment of ransom. 
The men had to be kept up to what the kidnappers have found a way sure to run away. 
Embassy German in Cairo has refused to make any comment on this story. 
Abuse of a father-in-law "that led to the suicide" 
A court has been informed that years of abuses inflicted by his father-in-law have taken a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, of Stithians, in the Cornwall, has been imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight leaders of charges for see of being made indecent. 
The district court in Truro has referred that it bound regularly his daughter-in-law, St√©phanie Randle, for his childhood 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise has written in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death". 
The tribunal has been informed that Melle Randle, aged of 34 years, has committed suicide at her place to Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007. 
Child when it lived to Coventry, Trerise had attached it and had an erection before forcing it to sexual acts, even though his mother worked on at the local pub. 
Trerise and his wife have divorced in the 1980s, and it returned to live in the Cornwall. 
His daughter-in-law left to Plymouth. 
But the tribunal has been informed that Melle Randle, regular voluntary of National Trust, was haunted of the abuses that it had inflicted twice per week. 
The general prosecutor, Ramsey Quaife has declared to in court that friends had told that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, seemed "emotionally dead" for 2006, and "had lost every hope to the life." 
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, has found it dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
One thinks that she has committed suicide suffocating itself with a bag plastic. 
Randle faced the handsome father of his girl that had besides, written a letter of confession that finished thus: "I attached it and bandaged it regularly". 
"I have not abused it sexually. 
"I feel responsible for his death." 
The judge Christopher Elwen has told to Trerise: "You are really strange as fetichistic, your victim probably had to be terrorized, especially to age of 7 years. 
"This saga unpleasant has ended with the of the victim. 
And what still more astonishing, it is the fact that if she had not committed this gesture, its history would probably never be finished to the court ". 
It added: "I underline in particular, such than his father and his mother describe it the effects of your crime committed for years on St√©phanie. 
"Without these, it would be no doubt aujourd" today, a young woman happy promising and success.

Societies of the building opposite the Bill B & B.. 
The companies British of the building could have to pay a bill more ¬£80 millions, to cover the rescue with the Bradford & Bingley bank. 
The Government has supplied ¬£14 billion to protect the deposits from the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interest of the loan be paid by all the societies that gather the money of the savers, including 59 societies of the building. 
The chief executive officer of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles has declared that it is "irritant" of that the companies and their members will have to pay the broken containers... 
The loan of ¬£14 billion be reimbursed when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys will be clear. 
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be produced, every year, to the 700 financial companies that gather the deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 societies of the building are include in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have had a behaviour cautious... owe now to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less careful. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
One proclaims that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits that she holds, and that the companies intermediary must pay about 18% of the cost.

At the time, the department had declared that the prosecutors were dismissed for because of performance mediocre. 
But it emerged afterwards, that the dismissed prosecutors were not criticized more than their other colleagues, what incited some observers to attribute a political connotation to these redundancies. 
Some of the prosecutors have been marked of being close to the Republicans of the Conference, even though others would have refused to hold an inquiry on the accusations of fraudulent vote against the Democrats. 
The American prosecutors hold an inquiry and prosecute the judicial authorities for the government.

A Street dark in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon in Sale. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, of boulevards, of streets and of other famous parallel, certain roads, of others uniquely functional. 
And even some taxis veterans as local residents of long date do not know to give advice to go to Place, because they have never heard some speak. 
The street is in the East Village and goes over the north of First Street- not to confound with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
Of about 30 feet of width for 120 of length, it looks like one gone dusty rather than to a lifeline is activated. 
Some signs indicate the streets. 
Finding it standard on a Atlas is potentially impossible. 
This street has however of admirers. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent buildings of luxury on First Street. 
He would want to repave Place, and to create a passage more fluid to the shops and the stores, which should open in the new buildings. 
D 'other admirers including neighbours long-standing, have declared to be charmed by it shortened simply because it remains one of the recent and oldest streets of p√¢t√© homes. 
But the Department of Preservation and of the Property Development of the city that manages the street, does not have any interest to keep it. 
This month, during a meeting of the committees of owners neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and of Avalon Bay have sketched out a suggestion allowing the manufacturer property to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new suggestion to subject the next month, has declared Susan Stetzer, the manager local of the committee not ¬∞ 3. 
"It remains only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would wish that the city preserves Place" has declared. 
"they could offer to replace it in state and to manage it, what of elsewhere Avalon could make, but we wish to maintain it public. 
Avalon Bay announced months ago that she wanted to repave the small streets and to install of the seats, some would be of elsewhere used by a coffee to which the manufacturer will concede the space. 
The proposal this acquisition potential was made public to the meeting this. 
Michele of Milly, carries it word of Avalon Bay, has declared that although the society wants to exploit the street, that does not mean inevitably that she wants in being the owner. 
"the main interest of Avalon Bay is of relooker this gone abandoned, and to make it public" has you it "declared, underlining that it was the city to suggest the sale to him". 
Seth Donlin, a floor door of the Preservation of Property l ', has confirmed that the city wished to sell well the street, moreover underlining, that the mission of agency was of rather developing the property that to manage it. 
Compared with his more florid neighbor, Bowery, Place has left a slight footprint historical. 
Some believe that Place carries this name for 1802, when the inheritance of the great farmhouse of the numerous children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving of being quoted this little bit of land, that remained for abandoned. 
The posterior entry of the CBGB a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has re open to extra place; the streets is probably more famous thanks to the photo in blanket of the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia" 
"this place was magnificent" has declared Danny Fields, to manage it of the Sweep, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scraps, of rags, barrels, posters, of leaves and of strings. 
Certain residents, including the bloggeurs that had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, are themselves opposites to the idea to sell Extra-Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Others have declared Extra-Place as a true rarity - a fragment potentially identical to the city that should be put in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, 'which drives a blog named Jeremiah' is Vanishing New York (subtitled the book of protests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Glance on A City in the Process of Extinction ") relates the history of the City and Extra-Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Place is a small narrow, dark cul-de-sac of day as by night, and marked by the doors of a warehouse in rusty iron and of the shutters, lots of newspapers of last week that fly away along the gutters." 
To few exceptions to, the street has always the same appearance. 
A rat runs agilely at the bottom of the alleyway, close to a door that led formerly at the CBGB, and that has now become the seat of a store of styles clothes. 
Of the graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, rests to quoted of newspapers that have just been thrown. 
Some passers-by have declared to think only seldom about Place, and suggested its value. 
Fjeld, of her quoted, has declared to think that certain under valued the attraction of the street in its state current. 
"The best years of my life" has you him declared, "him are unwound in places dark, wet and repugnant". 
The debate bilingual: Immersion in the English language 
In this part of the program of Supervision of the Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss of the position of the candidates about the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, previous member of the studies in California, and guiding antiques of the department of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the delivers "not so Good that You do not Think it. why must the middle classes be able to choose their schools. 
To attract the favors of the Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The suggestions of Barack Obama on the education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama underlines that "the Afro-Am√©ricains students and is Latino have less than luck in awarding a diploma itself that the white students." it is a fact true. 
To fight these differences, the program of education of Mr. Obama supports in particular the English among so many other subjects "the bilingual transitional education" for those that learn. 
However, the question that lands for Obama is of knowing if his desire to realize a bilingual education that defends the instruction in class of languages other than the English, goes beside his interest aiming at eliminating the differences. 
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of the east of the one related of Los Angeles. 
Students this school are Hispanic, and from bottoms come back in great majority. 
More than a third students, constituted of numerous new arrived, studies the English. 
Among the students of the CM1, 100% have passed the examination of State of mathses of 2008, expert level. 
Similarly almost 93% of students have passed the examination of English - of languages - of arts 
This success incredible was reached thanks to another ingredient that brought forward by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street bets on analyses, of the practice, a constant appraisal of the capacities as an exemplary attitude. 
Besides, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, brings back Linda Mikels, main of the Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion". 
The total immersion in English language focuses on the nearly constant use of the English in the instruction. 
Melle Mikels contrary to education bilingual, has asserted me "we have had an enormous success with a student who had just arrived of Mexico, 12 months after, if you went without his class, you would not have had any luck in identifying it. 
"That works, she observes," that has walked "for us" 
Obama should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and to reply it in the other schools composed in majority of Hispanic students learning the English. 
The excellent results obtained by this school talk about them even; but the policies on the education to the inside of his party (the Associations for the state education system support education bilingual for long) and its huge support for education bilingual, darken prognosticates it of the response from Obama. 
although it is favorable by the way the immigrants learn the English, Mr. Obama lately has considered this issue as insignificant, when it proclaimed that everyone must stop us of arguing on the wording of the laws in English language. 
"On the contrary, it declared," you owe to check that your child speaks Spanish ". 
if Mr. Obama wishes to eliminate really the differences, then he should consider with carefully, the models of education that work, rather that of scorning them or of considering them as insignificant.

With a victory in 2 03 :59 of race withdrawal on the menu, Gebrselassie has beaten of 27 seconds his record of 2 04 :26, argued the last year in Berlin. 
At 35 years ago, Gebrselassie has taken away the 26th world record of his superb career during which it has taken away the championship of the world or the world record for does not care what distance, of the 1600m√®tres of the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the marathon Olympic in Beijing, fearing - can to be in exaggerated way to the eyes of aujourd 'today, - which the pollution of the air does not increase its problems asthma. 
On the contrary, he promised to run at Berlin.

The runners of track as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all two kenyans, converted into runners, have contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in the past ten years since 1998, when the Brasilian one Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie has declared to the reporters, to have suffered from cramps to the calf two weeks before, and to have missed the training for a week. 
It is evident that the rest has allowed to him of remained brilliant, but not rusty.

In a City to Part, the Pride and the hardships of life black 
Hidden in the development of his immense park, at some milles of the sunny one, the shiny one and the giant Orlando, finds itself a small quiet city where the pride and the complications of the afro-am√©ricaine experience arise. 
"Eatonville, first entirely black city to integrate, house of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that it made in 1935, is not more so simple to make nowadays." the city in the five lakes, three courts of croquet, 300 darkened skins, 300 good swimmers, lots of guavas, two schools and not prison ". 
it has now become a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora Festival who stands every year to Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in various ways, the city that it describes - has become touristic thanks to his inclusion in the touristic guide of the Florida edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart from. 
It is as independent, worthy, and private that it was not it already in the years 30, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, qui"nous experiencing so little, does not know what it loses ". 
Even if it is a matter of the year of the election of a black president, the Senator Barack Obama, that has of elsewhere invoked an open dialog about the subject of race, a lot here remain careful of scrutiny from abroad. 
"we are very careful as for the way of telling the history" has declared Hortense Jones 59 years, r√©sidente for always and the most previous parishioner of the city. 
"it must be consistent with the reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and of fighting. 
It represents at the same time a historical model of a takeover of the blacks as a community of nearly 2400 people where the rate of poverty is two times obtains it national. 
It is a matter of a central point but also of an example of culture rural black Confederate - some times scorned, of other times acclaimed - that reminds the birth of the American slavery. 
What would explain why the residents are at the same time proud and protective. 
interest in image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everybody here calls Hurston. 
She presented its town home to the whole world through books sincere, full of dialect, such only "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide to the Florida transformed this city, situated at the exit of Road 17, a road that crosses the, often forgotten center of Florida, which led in chapter of the black history and of the human drama, just. 
Bold such a big cash in life as in the literature, Hurston has taken the readers to the store of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was divided afterwards into several parties private. 
"passed the road on the left handside", written language - her, "you will find the modern state school brown and white, with its gardens and these Aires game well preserved of which Howard Miller always has taken care, although he knows hardly to read and to write. 
It made moreover mention of the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells of drinks of all kinds as all it that can serve to the people. 
Therefore, in hardly a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with one car government but also to the analphab√©tisation, to the remarriage, and to the sex. 
Well evidently, Fodor was not thus. 
It was not in fact a portrait that everybody appreciated. 
Zora well has described the reality "has declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the young girls of Johnson that Hurston has immortalized, quoting the songs without color, interpreted by men who praised their beauty." 
It added: "some people have not appreciated". 
One remembers always Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family has moved at Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, reminded that Hurston arrived of usual in city without warning, aboard an engrossment Chevrolet a cigarette the mouth and carried of trousers here, where even aujourd 'today, one is proud of the dress traditional. 
Numerous residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin has told, even though a lot laughed at it. 
"the people were always happy to see Zora" has declared. 
But it adds moreover, swinging in his chair of the posterior patio that gives onto Lake Sabelia, there where Hurston was probably baptized, that 'it did not remain ever too long'. 
To the death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were apart from production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten it. 
Well that she was formerly a star of the literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College in the 1920s, it was buried in an indifferent grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, there where it lived. 
To Eatonville no great commemoration, nor plaque for the general public. 
I do not think that they have included the contribution or the inheritance that it offered to the world "has declared Val√©rie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s. 
Of the public officials of Orange County wished to make to go by a motorway to five routes in town, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, main street to ways of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already led Interstate 4 jusqu 'into the west corner of the city. 
The proposal was made then that Eatonville recovered very fair of a difficult period from its history. 
An integration forced, among so many something else, has taken end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, fights for it on the mix of races have taken the hatred to the gates of the community. 
"to this time there, one bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or of the objects against the people sat on the quoted one" has declared Mr. Franklin. 
"A woman is even dead. 
They threw one watermelon of their car ". 
In a letter of 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston puts in doubt the request of Runs it Supreme aiming at a forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of "insulting" Education "rather that glorifieuse of my race". 
The residents proclaim now that the elimination of the racial segregation in the schools, although is positive in some aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakens the trust of the youths. 
"the black children had the habit of being embraced - I remember some well - one embraced our the morning, and the night also" has declared N. Y. Nathiri, girl of Ella Dinkins as manager in leader of the Maintenance of the Community of Eatonville a group not profit. 
That has lasted, it added, until at the moment where the teachers and the students did not come anymore of the same place. 
"You do not kiss your white teacher because it is white - I want to say that it is here, a line of demarcation cultural has declared Melle Nathiri. 
The civil rights, of elsewhere, have allowed creating space for well of other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beside the damage, such as it, armed with a cheerful confidence own and with guidelines such that: "how they can do without of the pleasure my company! 
That overtakes me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker has given back itself on the anonymous grave of Hurston and has started fighting to make his reputation live again. 
Five years after, a biography acclaimed on realized Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, re-introduced it thus to the American cannons. 
The project of motorway has just arrived at the moment where the most famous girl of Eatonville had found its appeal. 
And this time, the old persons neighboring of Hurston consider it as a sauveuse one. 
The community has started organizing a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that the motorway would generate. 
Hundreds of fans have come to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and a lot come back in January, to commemorate it. 
After many years, the related one has rejected the proposal of motorway. 
The fiasco of motorway to five ways very fast, a true civic pride "has declared Miss. 
Nathiri. Melle Boyd has summarized the whole declaring that "Zora has saved Eatonville". 
The victory against the project of motorway has allowed him to change its own image. 
Not r√©sidentes people, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that frequents our church depuis1993, started coming in large numbers, and the residents started reconsidering the past. 
Eatonville is classified historical city for 1998. 
A library mono theme (reappointed well evidently Hurston) embroidered in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaved. 
Aujourd 'Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for the Florida: at six miles Orlando, it can to does not care any time to consider as a posterior street back itself during a summer day of rain, small such that it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(one counts aujourd 'hui 90 percent of blacks) 
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason of being, still are treated with caution. 
The permission must be asked for most of the interviews, and some things - as the walls of the church hurdy-gurdy of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating man white in the fields - must not be photographed. 
A lot to Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a teacher courageous and who has a weak as the red heart, are always afraid that their community island well is not understood. 
However, seen the expansion of the festival Hurston a certain level pride local is emerged. 
people Young in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its race whole: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, slogger, mad and mixed that the other groups ethnic and racial in America. 
It is affection Civic sincere of that l 'one hears in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, who plans to fall to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for the strengths of Police, which need forces additional. 
And even for the youngest, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the description Eatonville. 
"Most of the people, who pass to this area there, will think:" oh, this city anything has not compared with others "Alondra Kenon has declared after the church last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time of contemplating the history, it is a very beautiful city ". 
Here in New York, everyone speak ordinarily finance. 
Despite everything, nothing has changed. 
if tourists to Manhattan stood far from the newsstand and from screens giant of telly in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone. 
Never they could think only in the offices in glass and in nest bee above sucks them, the bankers and the managers of fund of hedge that monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of working in office" from working the fall 1929. 
The delivery men continue thread on the sidewalks, with their trolleys and their trays of muffins for the matini√®res meetings. 
The Latin drag always between the smart buildings carrying, as mules, fifty luxurious shirts hanged at a yoke arranged on its shoulders. 
The office juniors continue queue to buy the itinerant traders their matinier sandwich, and taking on a taxi between 16 hr and 19 hr during the week is always impossible. 
I had not felt the crisis in spite of the completely pessimistic stories jusqu 'to this after afternoon when I decided of going to open a new account of savings. 
Fortunately that I was planned me of working in end of after afternoon, because I discovered to my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, twenty people queuing. 
Not in front of the counters of the cashier, nor to withdraw species or to make a payment, but in front of the window of customer service, there where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked for the direction for the store Macy, and the new customers opened accounts. 
The majority of those in front of me, I would learn later Starr, my "personal banker allowed to", made everyone queuing for the same reason as me. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies from the smaller banks, as those of the New Jersey, of Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
they have withdrawn their money from the accounts of savings named thrifts (such a society of the building), of associations of credit, both the type of local crates of savings and their subsidiaries that work only in a state, and that say to treat the customers as their family. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have made gone bankrupt. 
These days Washington's, a bank to in the capital of 327 plus USD has made use to the property manager of bankruptcy, and even though the New Yorkers mend at home for the week ending on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, to the auditors saves of a value of 440 plus USD million, looked for d√©sesp√©ramment a buyer to save it. 
The bureau and the employees of stores that are in front of me, frightened of another potential collapse, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, or the one that makes the more of rescue Wall Street. 
Of The New Yorkers already have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a lady to my supermarket local Chinese, to talk on the telephone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that has made gone bankrupt, and about his thin chief executive officer Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it would have been able to have to criticize a colleague. 
And Lyn, the caretaker in uniformed in my building, has changed the subject from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or of deliveries of my fruit and vegetables. 
it has called me, with reference to visit to the bank. "I have put all my savings in the market of the monetary funds. 
"I have changed, I do not want to set of risk".

"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture the elements of his character" G√ºnther Bauer - Photographer 
Neither heels, nor clothes of New year's gift. 
The gasoline of the great masters of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain aspect relaxed from human rights or from the woman. 
From an 'artistic' l side '. 
Of the other one the person. 
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers to gestures intimate and stolen glances of the artists who do not care about going up on stage. 
The German G√ºnther Bauer mixes in "flamenco - people" the theatricals of some directions with singers, the country and guitarists with this side lesser known artists. 
In this project the photographer recovers the particular iconography of intoxicating spirit of flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Month of the photograph Flemish, 'l' exhibition "reflects importance international of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, bigger each day, explains the creator, which clarifies" that "flamenco -" people "can to be does not care that but, after having seen the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical pictures of artists on stage. 
These people photographed "in the streets" are artists capable of transmitting on stage of the passion, of the sadness, of the joy... captivating the public. 
To capture instants of personality of these artists one must not make of pictures on stage. 
They have a personality and one character unique. 
What interested me it was of creating a personal atmosphere that allows me to capture instants of personality of the stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco with the camera device ". 
With the festival "Popular singing of the Expressions", Bauer has begun in 1997 a long journey to photograph the singers, the guitarists or the dancers with a camera device to plate. 
It is are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera device and of the material, recollect the classical photograph. 
The implementation of different ways stylistic by breaks with the classical side of the picture, giving him a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the of intoxicating spirit of flamenco in Bauer: "A music with roots very traditional that evolves and that discovers every day". 
It is not a matter of the dance nor of the singing in themselves, but of the personality and of the character of the artist who captivates the public with its art. 
The research of the main part and of the magic has been the constant one of this work that l 'one present these days here to the gallery El Fot√≥mata. 
The celebrities of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco as Diego El, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, between others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists. 
The project is transformed into an anthology of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of the portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer has led to him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "portraits of sport" old persons ("SportARTproject"). 
although the concepts are different in "flamenco - people" the photographer admits that he adores to photograph the portrait of the people, to know them and to be able to enter to their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the kind the more difficult. 
You are opposite people, of characters that sometimes you do not know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to make them a photo. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, I try always that my ideas become reality ". 
This collection of portraits of the present flamenco that is called "Flamenco - people", is exposed to the Gallery El Fot√≥mata, situated to at number 20 of the Rue of Mated it (dashes parallel to the Poplar Grove of Hercules) that will be opened until 16 October.

America very fond less without Paul Newman 
"Of the times God creates people perfect 
Paul Newman made some part ". 
This sentence is of the actress Sally Field, who has worked with it in "Absence of mischief", and illustrates well the despair of cinema American, and of every America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is not more of this world. 
Him had of the grief to obtain an Oscar 
It did not turn anymore for 2007. 
Everybody knew that it was ill. 
That has been a hard blow for everybody. 
"Sometimes what the one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend", cried "Robert Redford," my life and my country were best "thanks to its existence". 
Nobody was afraid of making oneself ridiculous or of exaggerating. 
One of the fathers of cinema and of the homeland has died for a particularly dark period, where the terrorists and the stock markets frighten, the esteem of the American ones has sunk well low, looking desperately for reasons of dignity. 
when the times are so hard and without reason of living, it is not left to the human beings only the admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
It incarnated an ideal of beauty and of truth for everybody. 
it has been the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of the lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the fight antidrug created in the honor of her elder dead with reference to an overdose and the creation of its own brand of food bio. 
It was a victory for a country that has had the death to dominate against a culture food. 
This wave expansive admiration swept Hollywood without not minding either the nationalities or the passports. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, has noticed that no James Bond has died before it. 
Another English, the oscaris√© Sam Mendes, said what to work with Newman has marked the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"it has put us the bar high", noticed George Clooney, which is perhaps the only 'hui that tries to pierce the screen as l' has made Paul Newman: being very honn√™t and having a privacy serious and far targets. 
It is not always easy or possible in the jungle media nowadays. 
But there is the one that tries, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, at whom it has been faithful even if it did not miss the opportunities not to be it. 
"But why I should eat a burger apart from of at my place, if I have a steak in my fridge?", it had the habit to joke. 
At the sky, he attends with pride the meeting of his girls with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the great roles that it has interpreted, never it has been" as proud as that of the devoted husband, of the passionate father, of the thoughtful grandfather and philanthropist, "say him. 
Madrid in the race to the organization of the Olympic Games of 2016 
And yes, the dream of many among us is that Madrid can organize of the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, that could be fulfilled in 2016. 
But me I wonder if we are ready. 
if we take the example of the race of yesterday: we are not it! 
They call it the perfect race, but according to me it was the worst race that I have never participated in. 
if they had taken into account all the mistakes occurred during the race, these would make the object of a note eliminatory. 
But let's examine very in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the dossards, which obliges you to go there early. 
That is not badly but if they make you move it would be better that them you give everything (including the chip electronic for races). 
And well not 
They made you to go over there only to take the dossard (first mistake, to move only for that) and (after a long line of waiting) surprised!, there was only the size 'Sec' for the Jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
In what world do we live? 
Est - this - you - him because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that of shirts small with suddenly cheaper fabric and as a result less expensive? 
Well well, this is not anything in relation to it that has passed to itself on the day of racing. 
Apart from the fact that one must go there very early to withdraw the chip the queue is of 15 minutes and, furthermore his bag to backs must be left at the entry. 
The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, that is incomprehensible given that 11, 000 people are waited for these races. 
Since it is had a long line of waiting, the competitions have begun and yet we had not left our bag to backs to the entry, well once made, the withdrawal has only been worse. 
Furthermore The rain has accompanied the waiting of than 40 minutes from during which have taken place with the rebellions and with the assaults of the shack. 
I believe that around 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people as me, will not appear even in the classification with the time exact, because of the chip that they have considered me that, I think, has not marked correctly the start. 
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of race perfect, this would especially not come me to the idea. 
Thus I believe that always we will be able to dream of evolution the city host for the J. O. 
of 2016. Microsoft looks for a see (virtual) 
To The Conference on technologies Emerging of the PUT Microsoft has been presented a new system of gratitude of image and of human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence endowed with little intelligence but capable of fulfilling some tasks basic, as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle for to move itself in the campus company) in response to it that one has asked to him during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and to a system of recognition of forms and of faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the place, that they are including remembering what posts they occupy - and to listen and to hear the key words of their conversations. 
But also gathering them according to groups of conversation 
In the video of presentation the see detects one third person but she understands that it does not belong to the group that is speaking with it and that it is not part of the firm. 
She asks to him if it is here to visit to quelqu 'one and she tells to him that it will reply to him in a few moments. 
All this without screen blue. 
impressive. 
But of course that represents the future. 
Now the firm has something else on which to concentrate itself, for example on the next version its system operating, Windows. 
This week one has talked on top of a change about strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will not have anymore as many associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers were sold with essential 'l' instead of applications unnecessary, they would go five times more in a fast way. 
That represents a discovery since Microsoft version after version, has not stopped of being added of the duties and of the "extras" in Windows. 
The change of strategy is the welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its system operational loses of importance but also its software. 
when Google chromium has happened on the network, I have been the one of those that has adhered to the theory according to which Google chromium is the first step from Google to make competition in Windows. 
Several people have underlined justly that an Internet navigator is not an operational system. 
The system operating will be always necessary since it is the essential base so that the hardware and the software understand themselves. 
It occupies the same duty as your wife or your husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something. 
It is true. 
It will never disappear but the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a truth must be seen. 
This week, Ballmer has confirmed this idea. 
The people mind less and less to system operational but more and more to the navigator. 
One lights the computer only to make Firefox turn, To Explore or Chromium-Plate and every day the people spend more time to sail on Internet than to skim through windows. 
whose serve half of the applications supplied with the system? 
who can the more can the less. 
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less that Vista. 
Less heavy, congested month, less complex. 
For the time being, Microsoft is interested more in the launching of his own online services so that finally they become an alternative at Google. 
They need desperately that, indeed, and I show you an example. 
The photo presents in this article, has been taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rooms rest reserved for the employees of Microsoft to Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks a poster asks to them to use their own tool of research - your research. 
Our future ". In 2006 a study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to look for information on Internet. 
Last week a delay has happened in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not go out at the beginning of 2009 but to the end 2009 or to see in 2010. 
Microsoft will try surely to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, looks more and more like a computer. 
But the launching of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, that will cost to them expensive. 
The stunning Marcel 
Pablo Picasso put on it on the Coast of'Azur, 'Leonardo di Caprio carried an in the' Diamond of blood 'd Edward Zwick, as Al Pacino in' The Godfather 'of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the dress of Association of Gay heavy-handed. 
And if we start to enumerate all its appearances, also one could quote it sturdy mustached man who lifted up weights in a circus travelling. 
It is not a merely Jersey of body male in cotton, tight and without sleeves. 
The English ones calls it 'tank' but the stunning Marcel of Brussels distinguishes among all the others. 
First And Foremost, by his name blazing - although it is known under the name of 'Marcel' - that has to see with the sport since he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
The 'Marcel' distinguishes itself of the others by his excellent cotton, by its Cup single-sex, by its logo distinctive and by the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most well-known undershirts have in the neck. 
But attention, because the brand Belgian does not produce only that of the tank beeps. 
But it produces also of the sweat-shirt, of the boxers retro fashions, of the cardigans in cashmere, of the pants in cotton, of the babies, of the mini-shorts... 
Clothes imagined for the comfort of underwear. 
Even if carrying them only is unfortunate as underwear. 
They have too much charm.

since I am very small the clothes pleased me; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look in the cupboards of my aunt and to see its clothes. 
It was inspired, nearly better only of going to the theme park. 
Afterwards, when I have become dancer, I tried always to take care in my way of dressing myself. 
a lot love much well to be dressed for the course and the tests, to look at itself in the mirror and to feel well. 
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes it is there that you really put yourself in the skin of the man at this moment. 
As a result, everything is related. 
you had not 30 years ago: has that been hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever my 30 years delight me. 
I think that the woman is riper, has more experience and savors the life with less problems. 
The biological clock does not make me fear. 
I have made all the things that I wanted look small for everything and that has given me a lot of internal happiness. 
Then, think you evolution mother? 
Of course, I want to become mother because my body asks me for it and, furthermore, I want to become a young mother;

To see what you will think... 
a few days ago you have begun on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, it is not? 
Did not say that! 
I have not gone up on the bridge to make the model. 
Quite simply Naomi Campbell has called me, I know it from a time, for to invite me to participate in London to a procession of charity for his association in favor of support to for women and the clothes that us showed j 'have shown off two clothes of our collection create for Mango - were sold by auction to gather money for the NGO of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person to at the out. 
They tell so many things on it, to me I know it, many things are not true. 
Furthermore such good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
she has asked to me to march for a so noble cause, but if it had me to ask to make the pear tree, I would have made it nevertheless. 
The important one it is to give back life better to the women of in the third world. 
The recidivists of the alcohol at the steering wheel will have to install the system 'alcolock' 
The Minister of the Inside wants the driver who has had more three penalties administrative as alcohol level, to have to install in his car a system that prevents from starting up the vehicle in a state of drunkenness, or if he does not blow. 
The initiative has already been announced at in June and it appears henceforth in the relation of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last a year. 
Its aim is the reinsertion of the driver in it proposing lessons of re-education road. 
The Minister of State responsible for the road safety but for also the directorate-general for Safety Truck Driver and the Foundation Institute Technological for the Safety of the automobile will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists stopped to have driven more than once in a state of drunkenness the car recovers. 
The alcolock would avoid that since it is a system plugged in into the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting up if the driver does not blow before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is superior to that authorized. 
The cost is superior to 1000 euros and is pending the driver. 
To this respect, a study taken to the United States in 2007 demonstrated that the vehicles equipped with this device reduced jusqu 'to 65% of the offenses in the course of the first year installation. 
And in Spain one considers that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure keeps up that to penalties administrative for two reasons: making in view of these behaviour before they transform themselves into offences criminal. 
And to facilitate its implementation, since the reform legal can be made by see ordinary but, however, reforms it made by see criminal requires a reform of the organic law. 
The facility is not still available on the market Spanish in any form commercial, well only some vehicles industrial and of office possesses already one to title experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish socialist party that offers to install in the school buses this system as that has been made in France. 
In Mexico without 'peep-toes' 
To precise 17h40, predicted official hour, the airplane of the Spanish aerial strength in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential Shed of airport Benito Ju√°rez Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of going to bed but its shelves obliged still to put the hand by way of visor to be able to see the couple royal to go down of the airplane. 
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours beforehand I had asked in the street the driver taxi, if he knew that the princes Spaniards visited the city to finish their trip official. 
Ah, very well, as a result one will not be able to go to the airport to take on customers in this time here... Are you of here or then...? 
Not, not mister, I am Spanish but I have lived here thinking two years. 
Ah, very well... 
But the press Mexican knows very well that are the princes of Asturias and knows importance of travel. 
They are several to wait in the shed of the airport close to the carpet red and to a military line composed of 27 soldiers of Marine. 
The Prince is cheerful and dressed of navy blue, the Princess, when to it, has the hair to the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not carry his usual 'peep-toes'; maybe that they had told to him that a storm threatened. 
They make a brief ruling with the photographers before going by in the room where the entourage official waits for them. 
To the door of the hotel where they accommodate, one of the four largest hotels of city, a funny journalist of the television Mexican waits for them. 
The most prestigious price of the fashion 
There is not place more adapted in the world to present a price of fashion than Paris surely and there is not drawer living more extraordinary and kind surely live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to reinforce the international picture of new talents of the way. 
The winner will be rewarded with a prize 300 euros. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian gone out won the first edition, concerned his models in the window of Mango to the 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and it cried nearly of emotion. 
Indeed it is the second more department store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface. 
The first shop is in London. 
The events, as the desire of to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of competitions, has made that we have found in a luxurious dinner to the opera Garnier of Paris. 
With as table nearby that of the extraordinary one family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed still more spectacular. 
In having big on the heart and making Nati good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, against bad fortune has put a clothing of Mango and some finery of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arm above, arm below with his son Luis - a handsome man nearly of almost two metres high - it has accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honour.

Stars under the sky starred from Paris. 
Oh there, it is the life. 
1001, the antistress number 
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways of forgetting the chaos and the frenzy of life daily. 
And to crown the whole, they are everyone listed in a book that will bring of the relax one to the booksellers on 30 September. 
The alarm clock saddens us nearly when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is worse still when one thinks about the restless rhythm that the present life imposes us. 
The bureau is synonymous with tension and the computer of pains to the back. 
The stress represents the evil of 21st century. 
But there are not no one or two methods to fight the daily tiredness and the problems related to the world of work. 
But well 1001, nor one of more nor one of less. 
Apart from the positions of yoga, the classical massage or the treatments' spa ', Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book everything a' menu 'of methods adapted to taste and in times of each. 
The antistress work is called '1001 ways of relaxing' and will happen to the booksellers directly of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If quelqu 'one believes that it is not possible to obtain the peace in of the lieus as the work or through personal relationships, this' manual 'denies such a belief. 
Furthermore This handbook offers other methods as the contact with the nature or of the natural receipts 100% that help to relax. 
if the adrenalin does not run to your put to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has become a problem, it is time of sitting in the sofa, of disconnecting of his mind and of concentrating on the reading. 
Speaking sleeping 
A few children speak for the night. 
I do not refer to those that wake up very awake telling us something who has passed to itself on the day of before, but to the children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time that happens can surprise you, but in reality that does not have importance. 
It is a minor alteration of the sleep that is called somniloquie. 
It is frequent enough, especially by the children and by the adolescents. 
It is sure that there is there more than one that speaks for the night. 
This phenomenon can appear in way very sporadic (a time in the life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or in a more periodic way (every day, once a week, once a month...), on the day the child does not remember anything more. 
There is not unique cause that determines its appearance 
They are often related to other alterations of the sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors, l '√©nur√©sies night (to make pee to the bed) or the sleepwalking, but it is not always the case. 
as we have already said it before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, to situations of stress or of become agitated. 
Anyway it is a little studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable. 
It can itself that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, of the murmurs or on the contrary with shouts, of tears of long speech... 
In the case where the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and of consulting a specialist, to verify if there is a problem that provokes much of anxiety and in order to obtain an explanation for this problem. 
we have said that it is a distortion mild, it is why there is not treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of the sleep that can be looked after (for example, if it is related to an apnea of sleep or to stress). 
It that l 'one can make it is of taking into account a number of measures preventative Very simple such that: 
Trying not to excite the child before going to sleep. 
Consequently looking for Games quiet and avoiding programmes or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and which have the death to relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help them to calm down interiorly. 
That will allow the child to have a sleep more restful. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain quiet. 
You remind that they are inoffensive for the child and that the day after he will not remember anymore what has happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not waken it. 
It is useless since it is unconscious and you would waken it. 
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests therefore. 
Remind to you that if it appears very distressed several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to verify what provokes so much of anxiety by the child. 
if you understand what he says (what is not usual), do not have the temptation to question it to obtain information. 
You will not obtain anything, because sleeping, it is not conscious to be able to organize his thoughts. 
Furthermore, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is dreaming about, as a result made attention to the way at which you will interpret the information and to the conclusions that you pull. 
Never tell the child that you can question it for the night to know his secret. 
Even not joking. 
That provokes much of anxiety. 
In conclusion, you do not worry, that is not anything of pretty spiteful, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern... 
finally Illhaeusern has finally found the path of the victory on his ground after a long period of famine. 
Without making one big match, the yellow and black are created themselves the largest number occasions and have succeeded in transforming one for the profit match. 
The pace was not very elevated during this meeting where the attackers have had difficulty to express themselves. 
After a first of captain visitor attempt Kauffmann that brushed against the window on a shot by far, Illhaeusern was going to take lightly the ascendancy and turn to turn Fonderflick by far, then with Hirn above, Roman of the end of the foot or still Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie. 
Opposite, one sided in the middle of ground and one left just moving it Riahi to the forefront of attack. 
The start of second half was going to be decisive with surroundings two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by marshes, well positioned to recover a ball rejected on a first Diebold attempt (53e '). 
But the striker Illhousiens will long not be able to savor his happiness and will be obliged to regain the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and to leave thus his team mates in inferiority digital. 
But Dannemarie will not know to take advantage of it and will not put major problems to one Eleven illhousien that just has moved back a little "to compact" its defence, except for in the very last seconds of game where, after a big blunder the ball passed very close to the transversal.

The movement is propagated at other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the Sleeve, as to the Sands of Olonne, in Vend√©e, where the trawlers have stayed at quayside, or at the Haven, where twenty boats have blocked the movement ships of. 
The fishermen of La Turballe and of the Croisic, in Loire - Atlantic, have stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges in the evening.

But some fishermen Brittany do not want to be represented with persons in charge of the national committee of the fishing, which has not supported their movement. 
The strike is going to continue because "the fishermen will not release anything" and "because do not wish to move in Paris", has for example announced Liliane Cariou, the president of the committee of the fishing of Lorient. 
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the diesel oil, pay presently about 50 centimes by litre but they value that the threshold of profitability a boat is reached only with a diesel below EUR 0.30 euro per litre.

"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge necessary to be president", also it has assured. 
A corner of attack hammered for yesterday in the republican televised advertisements. 
Obama has, it, underlined that it represented the future. 
Without flustering, it has appeared concise and precise. 
he has put his capacity making the right decisions, and restoring the picture of the United States in the world forward. 
"McCain has not understood always, tandis only Obama, if", has retorted this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching to Republican of not having taken the whole measure of impact of crisis on him '"American" of the street ". 
"For the ninety minutes of debate John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing on you, has denounced Obama, yesterday, owing 20 000 personnesrassembl√©es for an electoral meeting in Caroline North under a beating rain. 
even it has not pronounced the words "middle class" or "workers". "the rout financial favors clearly Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the more ones in a position to saving the economics at the edge of the brink. 
"The week to come could be a turning point", valued, yesterday, the influential one Senator Democratic Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, some antiques of the administration Clinton, has compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during of the crisis financial 1998. 
For the candidate Democratic, the present d√©bacle "is the final verdict of eight years bad policy economic implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain". 
Reaffirming that he would manage nevertheless to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans in spite of downs of Wall Street, senator of also has notified that the realization of a possible energetic independence of the country by the promotion of the renewable energies was his first priority, with the arrangement of a system of assurance - health. 
McCain, it, has wished to build a park of 45 central nuclear of here to 2030. 
Careful the two candidates have evaded the questions dealing with the plan of financial rescue of dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday night by the Conference and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opposing showed Sunday night on the main place of the capital Belarus to throw back the results of the legislative ones of advance. 
A few hundred Belarus has met Sunday night from the closing of the polling stations on the central place of Minsk to protest the legislative ones against the nature fraudulent. 
Even though no result had been announced yet many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation". 
Some confess not to have same step voted for: "Why, since they will make what they want of my voice", said a young. 
They do not believe that the system that has made to observers foreign good face with the aim of recovering language with the European Union is ready to carry out a milestone democratic. 
The sanctions, of which the ban of visas for 40 leaders Belorussian and freezing of certain assets, could be raised if these elections were considered as own by the observers. 
they have not been it according to the opposition. 
"we have been kept apart from electoral committees electoral and our observers have not been able to participate in the deprivation", has lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of the democratic Strengths, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties. 
"It is a change cosmetic, underlines Alexander Milinkevich, previous candidate of the opposition to the presidential one of 2006 and leader of the movement pro-European, because the important one it is who counts the votes, and at our places, it is the executive power. 
if the MPs opposition enter to the parliament, it is that they will have been named, not members of parliament. 
But their entry into Parliament can mean area on television, of meetings in regions and of the suggestions of laws. 
The opposition is owed therefore of entering to the political game because "it is needed to start the dialog with the European Union. 
because if our economics, which heavily is put in debt in relation to Russia, enters in crisis, and that we do not improve, we risk to become a protectorate of Russia. 
Yet we want to be independent ". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for the safety and the cooperation in Europe that has followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the ballot. 
It underlines that the numbers of participation seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all the manipulation. 
"you have noticed that there was an election, you? questions the leader Social Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners freed in August from this year. 
There was not anybody in the polling stations. 
And five deputies from the opposition to the parliament, those that admit the best in power, will be to the maximum. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Commission Central Electoral congratulate of their success. 
The meeting - Of the blood become sure 
H√©ma-Qu√©bec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and his president, the Dre Francine D√©cary, was right of looking forward, because H√©ma-Qu√©bec has become one of the purveyors of blood more security and efficient of the world. 
And especially, it has reconquered the trust of the public that had been seriously undermined by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As one knows it, the national reserves of blood managed by the Service of transfusion of the Red Cross Canadian have been contaminated by the virus of the immunodeficiency acquired (HIV) and the virus of hepatitis C during 1980s. 
In the face of this tragedy and the discontent public the government of Canada has instituted in February 1994 a public inquiry, presided over by the judge Horace Krever, inquiry that aimed at making shed light on the circumstances having driven tragedy to one such one and stating recommendations so that such a disaster does not recur anymore. 
even though the judge Krever took a long time in putting down his relation some provinces then have put on up a committee having as objective to plan a new system of management of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee G√©lineau has filled that mandate. 
Subsequent to the relations G√©lineau and Krever, two purveyors have been created in Canada: H√©ma-Qu√©bec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Society of the blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when H√©ma-Qu√©bec has begun his activities, hardly 38% of people had still trust in the system of blood in Quebec, remembers the Dre D√©cary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts for to improve the safety of products blood and of work on the ground for the years that have followed, we have regained confidence the ", it says before asserting proudly that at the beginning of 2008, close to 94% of the Quebecois population trusted henceforth H√©ma-Qu√©bec. 
The Dre D√©cary keeps though in mind that "the trust is something extremely fragile". 
From its creation, on 28 September 1998, H√©ma-Qu√©bec has applied the principle of precautionary. 
At this time, one attended in Europe to the hatching of numerous case of the human form of the illness of the mad cow, a varying news of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tells the one that keeps the strong one from his foundation in 1998. 
"and we did not know at all if this disease could be passed on by the blood. 
One is itself then supported on one of the main recommendations of the relations Krever and G√©lineau, according to which when one does not know it and what a serious illness can follow from it, in the occurrence the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that a degeneration of the brain characterizes leading unavoidably to the death, one institutes measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, one has therefore refused the blood of the people who had stayed more than one month in the UK since 1980. 
yet a few years ago, it has been demonstrated out of every doubt that this disease is passed on by the blood. 
This episode thus has shown to us that the principle of precautionary that l 'one has applied had of the sense. 
In 1999 has appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive of screening HIV: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that allow detecting directly in the blood donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which rested the tests used jusqu 'then. 
The TAN have allowed of shortening the dumb period, which spreads between the moment where the person has been infected and that where the first virus can be detected in the by our technical, explains the specialist. 
one has been able to reduce this period to a period less than a week. 
thus one has reduced substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and that one can not detect them. 
These improvements have allowed lowering considerably the risk of contracting the Aids by a blood transfusion. 
Aujourd 'Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated by the HIV. 
"In other words, that means that 12 million fiery products will have to be distributed before that quelqu 'one is infected by the HIV. 
as H√©ma-Qu√©bec distributes more than 24 years between 400 000 and 500 000 products blood, that will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a product blood occurs. 
I believe that 'l' one can 'aujourd' now to feel to the ease of receiving or of prescribing a transfusion blood to recover the health ", asserts the leader of the direction of H√©ma-Qu√©bec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is of maintaining the safety of our products. 
One does not know ever what pathogenic is going to emerge in the system. 
Not more late that the past year has appeared on the island of the Meeting the virus Chikungunya that, to the instar of virus the Nile West, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
One must be constantly vigilant ", continues the Dre D√©cary before underlining that on top of a supply security, H√©ma-Qu√©bec also must foresee an supply adequate. 
"The needs increase because the population grows old. 
As The treatments anti-cancer are more aggressive, the patients need often a recharge in red globules or in plates. 
The ageing population has also consequences on the network of donors blood that gathers on average only 3% of the admissible Quebeckers to donation of blood. 
Anyone in health, aged of 18 years and more replying to the criteria of eligibility nevertheless can give of the blood every 56 days, or six times per year. 
On average, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they are affected of from AIDS or of malaria for example, and if they have traveled in a country where the malaria rages, they will be excluded for one year from one year. 
"With those 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that replies to the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they grow old and can not fall anymore from their blood. 
Yet persuading the people to fall from their blood, but especially to keep them and to incite them to become donor regular is difficult. 
The life of aujourd 'today being so frantic, one finds seldom the time of spending an hour to fall of her blood ", is distressed Francine D√©cary. 
With an budget annual of 297 million $, H√©ma-Qu√©bec supplies not only products blood, but of tissue, of which of the osseous transplants, of the cardiac valves, of the eyeballs and of the skin that is nearly exclusively used for the burned great ones. 
These tissues are analyzed, are transformed and are frozen before being stored at H√©ma-Qu√©bec that manages also the only public bank of blood of cord in Quebec. 
The cord umbilical that formerly was considered as a waste biomedical abounds in blood rich in cells stem being able to use to deal with the illnesses serious, such as the leukaemia. 
"one celebrated, a few weeks ago the bet in bank of our one thousandth sample of blood of umbilical cord, and one foresees in removing more than a thousand by year. 
one should start proposing for transplants at the beginning of the year neighbor ", clarifies the Dre D√©cary that describes this program of debiting of blood of umbilical cord as very popular. 
"Several mothers are disappointed with not being able to have access as it", because H√©ma-Qu√©bec does not have the means of proposing it programs hospitals in Quebec complex and expensive in everyone.

Charest bets on the North 
The Prime Minister does not exclude of starting elections before the end of year 
Immediately the Council General of the Party Liberal finished, Jean Charest has gone yesterday to Jean-Talon, to Quebec, where the new minister of the Health, Yves Bolduc (on the left), tries to be made elect to the occasion of the by-election of aujourd 'today. 
"Rejecting the limits of our last great border of the north": such a is the ambition in the long term that Jean Charest has looked with force visual all remaining in the main lines, at the end of the department council of the liberal Party of the Quebec, to L√©vis, yesterday. 
Behind it, during his speech a kind of Mill was planned at images. 
Turned in buckle, on three immense screens, of the spectacular snapshots of hydroelectric dams, of mining exploitation, of the Quebec seen by "Google Maps", of the cards, etc. 
The great resources as period election. 
In point of press, of elsewhere the prime minister has refused to exclude that it would start the election this autumn, even if it has made to notice that his timetable was very responsible. 
The "North Plan" is the fourth part a vision "only the Prime Minister claims to have as the Quebec, that of one" new economic space ", which includes a harmony on the main-d 'work with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and of an agreement on the. 
Often mentioned in the speech by Prime Minister lately, the opening of the North - the Territory Northern in the 49th parallel - had never been the subject to a presentation. 
The Prime Minister has limited itself though to explaining why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but he has not given deadline, amounts of investment, or precise priority in the projects to come. 
At most a few avenues of it that could be developed more: notably the hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by growth in countries emerging and reconstruction of infrastructure public. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, yet, money, iron, titanium, and same diamond", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest. 
This territory twice big as France ", it is at our places, it is in Quebec. 
Not only it is to our places, but it is in us ", it has insisted, as to show well that it solicited a myth national. 
The Quebec much is built itself in relationship with the North, it has underlined: the rush to the gold in Abitibi, the Quebecois engineering the Bay James. 
"It is" ours ", it is our future", it has added, after having had a break theatrical to contemplate the immense card behind it. 
The North, 70% of the Quebecois territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec always has claimed, has clarified the Prime Minister during the point of press. 
"It is" a position traditional "that all governments have reiterated. 
There is a line of border on which there is not agreement very long time and, when the occasion appears, I reiterate that position to on behalf of the government ", it has indicated. 
To the rest, "with climate change, must be reconsidered about our vision of the North", it has declared talking about the passage of the north-west, which will open the whole year because of the melting of ice. 
In this new geopolitical context the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits ones? 
The Prime Minister has said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to their respect and that the project would benefit them, notably to people young. 
As Two former ministers came from two parties different, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (antiques delegated p√©quiste of Ungava), already have started consultations next to thirty communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided over by Sanctimonious Furrier and in which Julie Boulet (transport and natural Resources) has an important place has started of the works. 
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit, but a time" where "one will be given itself" a common vision ". 
The development of North would be made from elsewhere in compliance with the principles development sustainable. 
The plan North will be "devised, tidy and respectful with the environment", it has promised. 
Jean Charest has described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of first minister Liberals that have preceded it. 
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new occasions of growth and of development." 
That has of elsewhere summer one of the recurrent themes of the end of week, which is started itself Friday by a large cocktail to underline the 50th birthday of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions offers to rename the Central one Beauharnois in Barrage Ad√©lard-Godbout. 
"From Godbout, which has created Hydro-Qu√©bec, to Lesage that has made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of the hydroelectricity, at Bourassa that has made the Bay James our party has known to build up the future", has declared Jean Charest. 
In point of press, him invoked another reference, conservative that, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963. 
Approaching the project of dam hydroelectric hydro-√©lectrique d'Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has underlined that its commissioning was foreseen for 2012. 
"That remains between us there, but I foresee to be to it", he has entrusted to his militants, arousing at their places fed clapping. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, which said in April that it would not be about election in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, has not discarded the possibility of starting an election this autumn, what the law allows him. 
It underlines that his timetable is filled though, notably by a mission of the advice of the federation in China and a summit Qu√©bec-New York. 
The Department Council of the end of week has supplied a platform containing nationalist resolutions, notably of the "constitutional aspirations" that are past as a letter to the post, to the liberal leader: the PLQ asks in particular for in particular the recognition specificity of Quebec in the Constitution. 
He also hopes that the Quebec appoints of members the Council from the broadcasting and from the Canadian telecommunications and that the latter have a right of veto on the decisions taken to in Quebec. 
From The side of opposition, one has received the main lines of the plan North with scepticism. 
The head p√©quiste, Pauline Marois, has brought out again the Policy of development of the Nord-du-Qu√©bec that the government Landry had thrown in 2001. 
According to it the government liberal, happening in power in 2003, has renounced to apply it. 
If it had made it, "one would be more advanced aujourd 'today has commented Mme Marois to the sides of his candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot that takes place' aujourd 'today) Fran√ßoise Mercury. 
The ADQ has said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government. 
"But what one wishes for, it is that is not fair a spectacle, has commented the leader S√©bastien Proulx, in substitution of Mario Dumont, who comes back of aujourd vacations' today. 
Letters - A dishonored country 
He is Mr. Vic Toews, ex-minister of the "justice" (ironically) in the cabinet To Tell Off, which allowed the last summer of saying about Louise Arbour that it was one to itself "shame" for Canada. 
Throwing thus the opprobrium on this woman that has led an incessant fighting for the justice and who deserves our admiration in being called as long on the environment of the Prime Minister as on Stephen Harper itself. 
Us these are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the implied western countries, not to have repatriated his national closed in the camp concentration in Guant√°namo. 
A government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the moment of the facts that it is reproached for. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada has signed the Convention of Geneva, renounces his word and lets stay in inhuman conditions a child - soldier. 
The alone who leaves to a travesty of justice to evaluate the guilt of accused. 
let's remind, for remember, that the UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, notably, plead for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he benefits from an equitable trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that closes the eyes on the torture: not it cares that a young adult psychologically is destroyed henceforth, no doubt forever after so many years of violence. 
One does not realize it yet, but we attend at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy", this word that To Tell Off does not stop of brandishing and that rings so hollow in his mouth. 
These are come the time that no moral exists anymore: one can manhandle, to torture, to imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the whim head of government so far minority group member (that it will be therefore after the 14 October...). 
A number of voters believe that they will take on the salvation in a party that advocates the Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, it is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of the 17 September the duty has published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, guiding vice-president of the Canadian open mine Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing an orwellienne logic, this asserts that the largest gold of the world has brought a pursuit in slandering of six million against three authors and a small house of edition without the cent with the aim of launching a "transparent public debate". 
if it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of pursuits in defamation, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely occulted by Mr. Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way of leading a public debate would be of taking whoever dares to support a position contrary to hers to the ruin? 
Whatever imports the solution of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the paper black Canada will have to spend sizeable sums in order to prepare their defence and of fighting, to weapons very, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets nearly without substance of the mining. 
The tactics in these struggles unequal, are of elsewhere often of ruining the defendants in order to impose some regulations to amicable 'l' that will gag the opposition on top of frightening whoever will dare to study again the issue. 
if Barrick Gold wanted really a public debate, it is in the face of the public opinion that it should have presented its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what makes in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works the debates in Canada are made in a normal way by the exchange of ideas and not through club. 
It met therefore the open mine of opening its books, his files and of establishing a true debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent teams of research that would have been able to make the light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and throws back of the hand the petitions and letters of support to the Canada authors of black Canada. 
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask for a debate the same public at the same time all scorning the views of the same public? 
In the world of vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to the handsomely paid lawyers and not the unity of the Canadians; this is a rather close the concept. 
In democracy, even the detractors have right to the speak. 
What does not include - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, it is that the public that supports the authors and Canada publishers of black Canada makes it above all because it throws back the manner brutal of the mining. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not within the framework of what several perceive as a pursuit - gag (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold comes of elsewhere of putting down a formal notice to the place of the authors of Canada Black ordering them to cease the use of it term... 
Beyond the overreal speech of Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any society democratic. 
She denies, as a whole, the right to the quotation of sources credible and to the debate on the facts and the interpretations, which represent the basis very of the work intellectual. 
if it is impossibleness of studying and of discussing of subjects that the wealthy persons attracted from this world in a country as of Canada under penalty prosecution repetition, that will be able to make it dislike? 
if Barrick Gold wanted really a debate public and transparent, it could make it following the scientific norms used by the Canada authors of black Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic environment, which we belong to, knows for long managing the debates and the disagreements and solving the conflicts. 
The pursuit disproportioned of Barrick Gold shows clearly that, contrary to what it claims, it does not have no desire debate transparent. 
It is a loss for the academic world, all as for the debate public in, and it is time that the governments set up mechanisms limiting this kind of prosecutions abusive. 
Operation rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and republican are heard itself 
The administration Bush and the leaders of Congress both Republicans and Democrats, have finally arrived to an agreement yesterday on the greatest plan of economic rescue from the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion American dollars aiming at slowing down the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street since for months must still be ratified through the two bedrooms of Congress. 
It foresees notably: a better control by the elected its implementation in application, of new mechanisms aiming at assuring the repayment of the committed public money, of new moods to contain the number of houses seized for lack of payment, as a right of glance on the salaries paid to the leaders of the helped firms. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative to the table of negotiations, the senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
"we have realized great progress with a view to a harmony that will be efficient on the markets", has declared the representative of administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been made in order to put the real economics and the Americans ordinary of the crisis ongoing in at the shelter to Wall Street", has explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not make of Americans that, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption on the lives daily will be immense", has declared the republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on mood of investors. 
time limit that l 'one sec' was agreed was opening of markets this morning. 
Associated lately with in the negotiations the two candidates for election presidential American have appeared rather favorable to the harmony, without missing however of expressing their dissatisfaction that l 'one be obliged to get to this end. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama has credited itself with the addition of some provisions in ground, notably that aiming at allowing the owners to preserve their homes and that on the salary of the leaders of the survivor firms by the State. 
"when one asks the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, you are welcome congratulating oneself. 
But these measures are essentials ", he has commented on the airwaves of television American. 
Questioned about another channel for whether if he would vote for the proposed plan, his republican adversary, John McCain, has replied: "I would love to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
The main lines that I have read [show] that it is something that everyone are going to have to digest us and with which we are going to be able to advance. 
The option of not making anything is not quite simply not satisfactory ", it has said. 
The plan 700 billion aims at purchasing with the money of the taxpayers the dubious beliefs, active to risk and unsaleable of the American financial institutions. 
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis started by the split of a property bubble that first has led to the collapse hypothecary credits to risk (subprime) before spreading to other forms more widespread of titles of credit (PCAA) and of leading on to a freezing of liquidity and to the scattering of banks and of the financial institutions. 
It is a group of republican members of parliament that had made the first project of harmony last week, founder. 
One believes to have gone out of this impasse since the democrats have accepted that some active "toxic" of the companies in difficulty only are assured by the government, rather that bought. 
In order to round off the corners for everybody to in Congress, also one has added an arrangement stipulating that if the government had to accept losses for five years with this programme, he could set up new taxes aiming at helping him to recover his bet. 
The new plan foresees the payment of a first slice of 250 billion that 100 others a billion will be able to add to if the president considers it necessary. 
The payment of 350 others a billion should be ratified by another vote of Congress. 
In return for his help, Washington will obtain participation in the helped firms that will be worth it of dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to resell when the storm will be past. 
The government federal will have the possibility of delaying the procedures of seizures regarding the accommodations attached to the home loans concerned by this plan, as of setting the leaders of the touched firms limits to the pay and to allowances starting paid. 
The architects of the plan would want to see it be subjected to the vote of the House of Representatives from aujourd 'today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts, it is not still certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued rise yesterday against this project both in the camp Republican that Democrat. 
"Of every obviousness, Washington does not hear you", has declared to the address of its electorate the republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of finance of the house. 
"Yes, we have a serious problem financial. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not one that consists in taking advantage of the taxpayers ". 
Animator of a small group to the Conference nicknamed "the caucus of the skeptics", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but arrives to the same conclusion. 
Four hundred eminent professors economy, of which three Prices Nobel, have written to us to call us: one asks to the Conference of not hurrying and of examining the way attentively to take ", it has declared yesterday. 
At The same time in Europe, one had a new time the proof of the nature global of the crisis. 
At the end of an meeting emergency the three countries Benelux have announced the partial nationalization of the banked group Fortis for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, of the Netherlands and of Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has made to know that it renounced to acquire his competitor in full shipwreck since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of the home loans to risk in the United States. 
Fortis uses 85 000 people and is part from of 20 major banks European and from the ten largest insurers. 
"It is not lost money, has declared yesterday the Dutch minister of the Finances, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and of the influence. 
It is precisely something that the savers and the households appreciate now that the time look uncertain. " 
For this time, of other side of channel the government British seemed in the process of nationalizing another bank manhandled by the financial crisis. 
According to the press English the government would recover to his account 'together loans underway by the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which 41 billion (75,5 billion US) of home loans. 
The bank Spanish Santander has made to know yesterday that it is she that would buy the branches and customers of the bank British. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this crisis financial. 
Paul Newman (1925 - 2008) - Dead Person of a committed icon 
His beauty to the eyes of blue was long card asset, of none will say its weakness. 
had it freed itself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor to in smile charmer? 
Yes and not. 
His embarrassment, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed for source will have it also far from the register of power that gives birth real monsters sacred. 
But what a great stayer! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years, of the continuations of a cancer of the lung in his ranch of Connecticut, residence one of the last icons of the American cinema of the years good. 
Less monumental than Brando, like whom it looked and of which it was long a sort of rival to the screen, more careful in her game, probably more fragile, but apostle also of the freedom and of collapse of the conventions dramatic. 
The mixed blood makes often children magnificent. 
it has been born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and of a Hungarian mother of origin. 
From These roots European one of faces at the dream American will be born. 
Without excessive ego ultimate mark of quality. 
because in it a whole country enamoured of self made man fell, of the fighter of the war of the Pacific injured in battle, that at the beginning of early 1950s studied the dramatic art to rapidly receding then frequented the Actor 'is studio in New York, before triumphing to in the theatre, on television, soon to film. 
This same man who militated in favor of civil rights was also the self-propelled pilot who ranked second at the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled of a sex symbol, although member of a couple models formed for 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Disappear also with it the zones of shade of this secret, discreet star, committed, allergic to the splinters of the show-business, whose enigma one will totally not have pierced. 
A gentleman, to in the sense truest of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has obtained the swindle for the cinema goers this later week, even though major roles clatter on the black screen of the memories. 
More than one demi-si√®cle of a seventh art American ever-changing marches through it. 
Come back to jostle itself in memory the cowboy of charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man throwing back his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a roof burning adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
More close to us (1990), one evokes his sensitive mister Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fill all its promises. 
So many others Paul Newman have passed to the history. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by the hatred), of Robert Wise, a role intended to James Dean, recovered after his death, who threw really Newman in 1956. 
This nice criminal in the brillantissime The Sting (Rips It Off), Oscar of the best film in 1973. 
Bitter and revengeful player of billiards in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), it will recover the character on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which was worth it in 1987 his single Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through the ages, it was it. 
Still it. 
The times jostle themselves across his career. 
The young know it especially through the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a team of little orthodox ice hockey. 
Its fans have found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers releasing. 
With a last role of godfather of the Mafia Irish in road to Iniquity of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was curly. 
At the encontre of several legends of the cinema that released the profession early enough, Newman will have remained long in back track while denouncing Hollywood, its on, its fanfare and its concessions. 
The French director Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a challenge living to" the underplaying "considering its benefits too much supported. 
The profession always has not been soft-hearted person for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
He played however less often the young first that the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastards or desperate, of which its features perfect reflected the drifts and the revolt. 
As director, Newman revealed badly well-known facets of its real sensitivity both. 
Its Rachel, in 1968 (of after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew of a end portrait female melancholy. 
He that lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and to him Her in 1984, work of shame and of sadness. 
Among the rain of respects that erupted yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former husband of weapons Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) asserted, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love of the existence are of the features vibrating of the disappeared actor. 
Beyond his career of myth, disappears also a great militating in favor of the civic rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, a critical excesses of Hollywood. 
one will have seen much his hoe throne on containers of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad enough taste, although joke at the outset. 
Profits from these sales were nevertheless paid at his foundation for childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than of sitting on its myth, will have started up to the end. 
it has left its five girls a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until at the end your father has been unbelievably grateful of his good star. 
Being there was a privilege. " 
And a privilege for us of having followed the path an artist American if lucid and so generous. 
Citoyen models, in short and in addition. 
how well could produce Zuschlag & amp; Company in their factory in bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, the audiences referring to the procedure criminal, against J√°nos Zuschlag and his accomplices, are going to begin. 
The politician and his accomplices are marked of swindle, in the form of criminal organization, in permanently and, having generated damage particularly important. Other leaders of accusation have been kept against them, as such false and use of false. 
Of after the parquet, the money coming from subsidies, was spent at for gain personal, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money of the State and of the municipalities, about 65 million HUF altogether, went on the one hand in the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, made public also by the authorities of inquiry, was of touching the money of the grants obtained issuing bills of cost, behind which no provision real was supplied and behind which thus, the associations never respected their commitments. 
According to the bill of indictment a large part of the bills were fake. 
For the latter, they obtained notebooks of bills at the market of J√≥zsefv√°ros, while they produced the seals at Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of societies that were going to appear on the bills, it was decided, between others, in the course of the rounds in province of the North of North Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv√°n Lados, on request from J√°nos Zuschlag. 
From after the evidence of this last year, it had to spot pensions and restaurants. 
For his consumption personal, he asked for a bill, on the model of which they realized the other bills that they were going to introduce, between others, into the Ministry of the Youth and of the Sports, of the ministry of the social affairs and of the work, as of the City of the capital to reach subsidies. 
The majority of bills was created by Istv√°n Lados and by his laughed accomplice Andr√°s, who according to our information, took care especially of writing the files necessary for the obtainment of the grants. 
During a "circuit of location", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003 this place has insured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes√ºlet. 
However, according to the intentions of the manager, it would have been impossible that as many people occupy this place, at the same time. 
In the same way, in summer of the year 2002, the bill established on behalf of the foundation Jobb J√∂v√©rt, that thereafter will carry the name has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt, swarmed with mistakes of forms and of substance. 
One pension, situated to Badacsonytomaj, had in reality only three bedrooms, and maximum ten people could pass there the night. Nevertheless the bill mentioned one hundred thirty customers. 
The transmitters of bills to the bursting imagination have also fallen in the excess, while they mentioned the society Pigal Kft, belonging also to sector catering. In their accounts, nor the name of Jobb J√∂v√©rt, nor that of the Hopp√° n 'appeared, according to the information given to in the public prosecutor. 
Gyz Farkas the manager of society, has declared to the site hvg.hu that while the public prosecutor has convoked it and has shown him the bills, he has known, immediately, that it was a matter of false documents. 
"The name of our society and our number tax were put at a bad place on the stamp. 
It added: "Beyond the form, the fact that of after invoices it 100 people have accommodated there, did not stick either, since this establishment does not count only eleven bedrooms, which do not have as much place. 
Furthermore The bill mentions also of the meals, and our restaurant is closed for well long. " 
Issuers bills zealous are not themselves either informed about the travel agencies of Budapest, being part of their choice, but organizing trips abroad. Thus they have, na√Øvely, indicated stays in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, what goes also to the encontre of the practices accounting of agency. 
Of overbelieves, as it has appeared during the inquiry, they added also the VAT on these documents, even though the benefits regarding the activities of journeys, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT. 
Similarly, the rate of VAT of the four bills established on behalf of the Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p to the order of Jobb J√∂v√©rt was incorrect, since the benefits of the society do not support a VAT of 25% as advisable, but one VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the employees of the hotel express only bills printed, while the fake ones were written by hand. 
The inquiry of the parquet reveals that the "transmitters" have also committed mistakes mentioning as provision the transport of merchandise by road, which the emitting society of the bills could not exercise, considering that his profile was the advice in investment. 
Furthermore, it is also for vices of forms, as the types of inadequate bills and counterfeit tablets, that invoice them issued to the order of Egy√ºtt has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, of XXI. Sz√°zadi Kultur√°lis Egyes√ºlet and of Biztos Pont have revealed fake. 
All as in the case of the society Ravenna Bt. or of the sport training of Kunfeh√©rt√≥, that all two deny to be the authors of the bills issued in their name. 
The forgers do not have either lent attention by the way only the society HIB Kft., established to Ny√≠regyh√°za, was in liquidation at the moment where (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V√°ros√©rt Egyes√ºlet was supposed to take a meal at their places. According to our information, it is for why this that the liquidator of the society denies to have expressed this bill. 
Bills established deliberately 
Another category of transmitters of bills is that composed of those that were totally conscious that they were asked for it of issuing bills fictitious. 
The foundation Es√©ly Budapest√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj√∫ Szocialist√°k, has established a bill to order of the foundation Egy√ºtt has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt, for a sum of four million HUF. 
According to the bill of indictment, the manager of the society Collab Kft. it was led to issue fake bills by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy√∂rfi. 
Similarly, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, the society Biogate Kft., which is presently under liquidation and who in 2003, has expressed bills to the order of the foundation Jobb J√∂v√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, of the association Atlasz Egyes√ºlet and the association V√∂r√∂sfeny Egyes√ºlet, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no provision has indeed been supplied. 
No movement financial has taken place, either, considering that the issued bills have been canceled thereafter, but that, the bodies well have avoided mentioning it in their accounts. 
The next category of emitting societies of bills is that of companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the administrative delegate of the chief executive officer of the society Delta Tri√≥ Kft. taking care of the business from fuel and from self-propelled vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was introuvable, Iv√°n Kubatov was. 
In October, November and December 2005 this company has expressed several bills regarding the sale of computer equipment, for an amount of about 18 million HUF. 
According to the inquiry these devices would have been bought by the society Cash Investment Kft. Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of the company was a man of Rumanian origin, which Iv√°n Kubatov would also have made get to sent in relation to the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to what we know, Kubatov has admitted during the inquiry that it has issued bills to the order of the societies Atlasz, Hopp√° and of Egy√ºtt has Harmadik √âvezred√©rt Alap√≠tv√°ny, and that he has pocketed their equivalent. 
It is precisely at the request of Iv√°n Kubatov that builders Romanians have created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. 
In reality, none of these companies worked, what the defendant explains by the fact that they did not receive work. 
Nevertheless he used these societies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, codefendant as editor of the acts of foundation of the societies, it has established bills to their names, to the order of relating referring to Zuschlag, as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener√°ci√≥. 
Kubatov has given to agencies, 15 bills altogether, expressed by the societies Cash Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF. 
The public prosecutor thought that 10% of the sums indicated on the bills as the VAT went to the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the society Szi-Beri Bt. to establish imaginary bills that have been used within the framework of the request of grant of Biztos Pont. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Gener√°ci√≥ and Sz√∂vets√©g has Modern Magyarorsz√°g√©rt have introduced a request of grant next to the organism of public usefulness of the socialist party, T√°ncsics Mih√°ly Alap√≠tv√°ny (TMA). 
they have obtained this subsidy for an amount from twice 500 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives indicated in the request. 
To avoid that being known, five imaginary bills received of the society Works Team Kft. in MRI has been presented to. 
Of elsewhere, it is these bills that have been found during the raid carried out in the Bureau of √Årp√°d Kemecsei, to the Ministry of the Education. 
During the audience some of the accused will relate the method of fabrication of the bills, as it had already made it in front of public prosecutor earlier. 
It that could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, J√°nos Zuschlag itself, decides to raise the veil on all the history. 
Up to at present, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised on several occasions to tell the lesser details, it has not yet made it. 
The question is of to know if it is in its interests, or then, possibly the Socialists would have concluded an agreement according to which in return for the repayment of a great part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would carry only the hat. 
Aujourd 'Today, the latter probably is hurt, since the requests for his investment in residence watched, on base of a lightening of its conditions detention, fall continuously in ears deaf. 
While those that have caused damage much more important, and the authors of crimes economic not repairable, go for a walk freely or at least, wait to their own home the end of the procedure. It not has not this possibility. 
The psychology of one-upmanship: why does one spend more money? 
During auction, the purchasers have tendency to spend more, and to overestimate the commodity. 
The researchers in neurology and in economics of University of New York have succeeded in updating basis neurological and economic this behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
Of after their study published in the Science review human beings do not want to be outdistanced during this type of competition, as for example an auction on eBay, and it is why they prefer even to pay a price too high. 
draw up have tried to draw up a neurological diagram of this kind of "game" with the aid of auction experimental. 
One of the groups of volunteers played at the lotto, while the other group took part in a play auction, while with the aid of a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf) the researchers analyzed the areas brain assets subjects experimental. 
In the two the participants could win of the money, but during the auction an element important is the escalation of a third, the unity being found cerebral under the waistline, called striatum, put on the move in way intensive during the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism d '"of the system nervous. 
It is why, according to the researchers the rise in prices is explained with the escape in the face of the reaction violent of the. 
In Support of This of their theories, the economists members of this group of researchers have hounded analyses with supervision financial. 
During these three groups bade higher opposite a partner in various circumstances. 
they have quite simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question, and they have thus carried out their bet. 
To another group, they have promised that if, besides, they took out winner of the game, then they would receive 15 dollars additional, in reward. 
While the third group has shone receipt these 15 dollars before the auction, but members of the group lost also money, if they lost the auction. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was put at the one on the victory, while by other 'l', on the failure. 
Proving thus the hypothesis of the neurologists, to the members of the team of the players "against the failure" higher bets were disposed that those carried out by the group control and the group "for the victory". 
"These results can not be demonstrated by any theory economic existing. 
Indeed, each of them did not explain the phenomena noticed during auctions that by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front risks it. 
Only the methods of imaging neurological have helped third explanation to remove the contradiction between the theories leading on, now, to one. "- has noticed Andrew Schotter, the teacher of the faculty of the economics of University of New York. 
The hepatitis: when must we consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer of hepatitis B or C columns, while in Hungary, the disease chronic liver is mentioned among the main causes of death. 
One values at 100 miles the carrying patients of the virus of hepatitis in Hungary, but alone seven miles follow a treatment. That is of the by the way that often the patients do not know that they are carrying of the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections concerning the liver and caused by different viruses. 
There are similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and the generated illnesses defer ones of the others. 
The viruses of the hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, principally spread under two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated) the hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses by the blood and the organic liquids (semen, vaginal secretion, spittle). 
For the travellers, it anyway it is recorded to make to vaccinate has and B. against the virus itself. There is not vaccine against the C.. 
The symptoms of the hepatitis has appear two to three weeks after the consumption of foods contaminated, in general, accompanied with general bad state, with weakness, with harm of stomach and with nausea. 
Afterwards develops on the skin and on white of a visible jaundice, the saddles become clearer and the urine takes a more darkened color. The recovery can take two to three weeks. 
Across the world, every year, a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, as the cancer or the cirrhosis of the liver occasioned by the hepatitis B.. 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only a ill on ten receives a medical treatment. 
The hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a cirrhosis or a cancer of the liver. 
Most of the patients is not known affected of the virus, because the gene causative destroys the cells of the liver in way underhand. In many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years. 
Consequently an prevention early is very important, as from the regular tests of screening. 
The contamination is raised much more among a population of three groups than the average is: the people having suffered a transfusion blood before 1991, consumers of drugs and the tattooed ones. 
Presently, one encodes at 200 million the affected patients of a chronic hepatitis of type C in the world. 
since the disease can be detected by an examination of routine in laboratory, it is recommended of consulting his doctor treating as symptoms of unknown origin from the observation. 
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the organism, in this way risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is warned. 
On The 30 September people are the world day of the hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organisms representing patients of the four corners of the world. 
His aim is of attracting the attention on the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by the viruses, on the causes of its development and on the importance of diagnosis early of disease. 
Does the one that increases in God feel the pain less? 
Of after the results a research recent the beliefs religious would work as a sort of painkiller, which already would have contributed to make more bearable the death of the Catholic martyrs. 
The British daily Telegraph has published an article according to which researchers of the University of Oxford have realized an experiment interesting analyzing at what level the belief in God could influence the tolerance to the pain of the human being. 
Within the framework of this at least strange experience, 12 Catholic believers and as much of atheistic have been subjected to electroshock therapies, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results the believers Catholic have been capable of excluding a large part from the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, one has also been able to discover that the Catholics have been capable of activating the part of their brain responsible for regulating the pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, which academicians, the scientists, philosophers and theologians participate in from different sectors of university. 
More precisely, the experience takes place in follows as: an instrument producing issuing sparks and diffusing the electric-shock is set on follows hand left of the subject experimental. 
The researchers have asked the participants for experience of looking in an elevated way at two paintings, the one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato at the 17th century and 'other' l ', Rams it at the ermine painted by L√©onard of Vinci at the 15th century. 
The researchers at root of this experience expected from state of faith among the believers that the sight of the Virgin Marie evokes a kind, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, dealt with his soothing effect. 
The subjects experimental have spent a half-hour in one to scan MRI, and for this time, have received 20 electroshock therapies in four succeeding part, everything looking is paints it to theme religious, or that to more general. 
The Catholics have declared that in full view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "in safe", as quelqu 'one of which one "takes care" and they are themselves "calmed, and the peace has invaded them". 
In full view of the painting of issues religious, they have reported on 12% of pain in less than while they looked at of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, that has itself taken part to the experience, thinks that l 'one can reach the same effects with does not care what other strong picture, among the atheistic ones, to condition of finding the photo appropriate. 
"we should find a picture opposite which they reacted very positively, as for example a mother or a father," has declared the psychologist. 
Tom Wright bishop Anglican, has greeted the results of these research. 
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, changes indeed our personality", has added Wright. 
After these excellent results, it does not remain more than the question of knowing what would be the effect on the regulation the pain of the subjects if l 'one watch to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same arms? 
would the sight of a Virgin Marie of better quality cause better results? 
You are what you divulge to tone subject 
To opportunity of his tenth birthday, Google maintains that one can find it at the bottom of the pocket of people in the same way as the sky over their heads. It knows where they have spent their holiday, which experts they consult and what are their centres interest. 
It is nevertheless not still enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the people influential in society. 
while in what concerns the skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, these do not see precisely not the main part of the web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt has declared, it is little, in the Financial Times that ambition main of Google is of gathering all the information the world. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their initial objective that sounded as follows: Gather all the information of the world in a system! 
According to the leader of questioned Google, after ten years of a work of world chamboulement, they are always only to the beginning of their objectives of being able to treat all the information. 
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt has replied that he would love that Google can reply to question as "That I could make tomorrow?" or "what is the work that would go me the best"?. However the software will not be able to reply to this type of question, simple to first sight, only on the day where they will know they enough on the users. 
It is not perfectly clear for all users that the words used during for research on Internet, the address IP address of the computer that launches the research and the pages consulted afterwards by those interested precisely are listed. 
By the intermediary of the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, the users can, for example, stock their own historical research and can consult it that they have looked for, on which they have clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program being based on the same logic, will be in a position to giving much more personalized replies, and will subject us of the products and of the services on base of our statements previous and of our recorded preferences. 
What it arrives if quelqu 'one helps of my data against me, if it looks what is my work? ask for the users, which worry seeing the monopoly of information of Google. 
In most of the cases, it is the potential power represented with the society that can arouse fear, and it is not bites it, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can arouse by the Internet users a contre-r√©action. 
It is however a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justifying cases, they are passed on to a third, and in this kind of cases legal, nothing protects the personal rights from of customers. 
The example the more ones ringing of lately is probably the action coordinated against paedophiles Brazilians, during which Google has transmitted to the government Brazilian the information that it had gathered on the page public called Orkut, allowing thus an identification. 
The Internet users concerned about the rights of the person have been able to push a sigh with relief in May last, while Google, arm confused underwear with body of protection legal electronic EFF, has proved his good right to the court opposite the FBI. Of after the sentence given back, in the future, Google will not be able to be obliged always by any of the points of the constitution of divulging information on the secret request for the FBI, of whatever nature that it is. 
(At the same time, the federal government has obtained with successfully some 50 addresses web and 1.000 terms of research that it had taken away in relation to the reinforcement of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years earlier. But after all, it does not succeed in obtaining the lists of investigations of users private, nor lists it whole of websites and of the key words of the past months).) 
The trial of Google is therefore contradictory enough: it is flayed by those that fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their sphere intimate and their sector private suffer from it while they start using the services Google. Consequently, they attack them in the mind of revolt that one demonstrates against the companies multinational proud of their image conservative. 
During this time, the American geek culture and his "wild stocks" gathering the fans, the activists and the enthusiastic users of the computer who appear in of numerous countries see in Google the next generation of the great firms, the "corporation plugged in", in contrast his rival, Microsoft, cataloged as invader of the world because of, and it, even if all the two fight for the even goal. 
That can be explained by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask his users for code of identification, does not require money for its applications. The code documentary and the packet of programs, continuously cooled, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in view of the practice of giant official software. 
The reason also can be that the geeks see exactly the relationship problematic between the rights of the person and internet, and it that the web 2.0, the key word the more proclaimed of in recent years, gets out precisely behind it. 
Indeed, the web 2.0 does not concern other something than the cooperation, only the fact that we leave intentionally traces behind us, and that we use the canals of communication put to our arrangement, and that while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main part remains the same one: 
one exposes itself. A young in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and even it can connect these to other benefits, as for example to Twinter, or to last.fm, listing its habits musical. Afterwards, it can connect these to a system of pursuit, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. these young people also can take after the blogs, in which appear automatically their most recent galleries of photos that they stock on Flickr or on Picasa. 
while one can read of numerous examples, as that of the boyfriend who understands easily in full view of the photos of the morning, captures by the circle of common friends, with whom his friend unfaithful has passed the evening, or that of the society that has dismissed one of its employees, nothing that for the sincere opinions that this has written on his blog about the top management, one can be on of one thing: the term of private life is totally to reconsider nowadays. 
The one that lives a life online, is constituted of what it shows of itself, and it is as l 'one can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour from the youths of aujourd' today. 
That wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to walk round the monopoly of Google, can be it (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the system of research Google, but, at the same moment, not leaving no trace) intentionally). 
The number of people who, deliberately, are not recorded on pages public so that finding them is not possible, is not lesser ones. The services of Google online, going by the word processing to the treatment of image, to the reading of information can be replaced with alternate versions, which are not connected to enormous parks servers and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed until at this day. 
The public opinion waits, without really hiding from it, for the moment that Google will unveil its true nature. 
The society, with its value current of 156 billion dollars, is more worth than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The advertising domains AdWords / AdSense threaten the number of businesses of the publicity agencies, while the benefits introduced to a speed of increasingly important occasion serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to numerous other creators of computer programs. 
However observers critical find, beside all that, contradictions having worrying effects: for example, the management beep of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the mother enterprise and after the society has judged too much expensive the daily numerous restoration, takes does not care when. All that seems pathetic beside the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced in front of the government Chinese and of after the terms their agreement, the society detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as the interests of the regime Chinese. 
Of after one of the rules internal of society the new services are not announced while they can only be used. It that is on, it is that in the coming months and next years, they are going to make to move the world on new points. while some think that the project of scan and of archiving of books and of magazines Google takes dimensions so important that the society goes soon to meet itself opposite the High Court of the United States, others shiver in the face of its system health, because in this, one can build a benefit medical complete from our previous results of analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google organizes a basis of data genetic can give a good raw material to the next generation of authors of science fiction. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwelliens semitones, describes the future in which a man could be approached to way outrageous nothing that through the data to Google.

The financial crisis of the viewpoint of the European press 
In their comments of the Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, aggravating 'sec' of day by day, the leaders newspapers of the European press evoke already a "second 11 September". 
"The global financial disaster, one owes it" to the American president "- undergo the daily of Rome La Repubblica." The president has not been even capable of siding with his specificity left behind a bill of law, improvised in a rush, aiming at carrying help to a situation heartbreaking... 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the multimillionaire Warren Buffett evoked it, more it is adapted of talking about one second 11 September. 
Part of the press Madrid sees also the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El, it is the shortcomings of the leadership political of over there that has taken the world economics at the edge of the collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the system financial American sec 'accroit every day, and thereafter, the world is going to pay will the price high. 
The plan of Bush was far from being perfect, however according to the vote of the conference a real threat, the one that Washington does not propose tool talks about politics to treat the crisis. 
The world economics hangs to the empty, fair one at the moment where in history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes takes place. 
one can no more long not ignore the threat - underline the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states can still tighten a lifebuoy at their staggering financial organisms, and thanks to money from taxpayers, they can rescue them from the bankruptcy. 
Of course, if still more banks founder such from the dominos, then neither financial means, nor new improvisations will be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need that the member states Union European make cases of self-interest national, and that they centralize the control above the divided stock markets. 
Nothing that Monday, the weakened financial organisms have received more than 100 billion euros - has reminded the viennois daily, Der Standard, that adds that the fears according to which the European taxpayers also are going to have to put the hand to the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the American ones in the aim of to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic. 
Up to here, the EU has really not taken care of the crisis, which, as a tsunami, crosses, de part en part the old continent. 
The "rescuers" must not brandish immediately a hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noticed in what case it would be rational to touch to the money of the taxpayers, with objective 'l' of warning about more serious damage. 
The intelligent automobile imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
what method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of a detector of that exists existing already in the nature? 
As for example, that of the bees. 
In the astonishing project presented during the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees have given the strategic idea of starting to engineers from Nissan, to inspire them on the way in which they must imagine the next generation of detectors of obstacles. 
In collaboration with the university of Tokyo, Nissan has built a robot mini car, a system to order self-automated bio-inspired, of type BR23C, who he has equipped with the qualities of the bees, the being final objective one of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles. 
During its flights, every bee constitutes his own area form oval, that in reality, looks much like our hull of secured protection - has explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the manager of the department research both development and relations public technological the brand. 
to facets of bee plays a primordial role, since seeing in all the directions, in a corner of 300 degrees, is capable. 
To imitate the functions of to facets to, the engineers have approached the idea of the telemeter at laser. 
This identifies the obstacles in a corner of 180 degrees and to a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, he evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor of edge, which transforms it into maneuver of avoidance immediately. 
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a split second. Afterwards, the mini car robot, imitating the movements of bee, changes immediately the direction from its wheels turning it of a corner sufficing to avoid the collision. 
Contrary to every system existing presently, this maneuver of √©vitement entirely takes place in way instinctive. 
"if it was not thus, the mini car robot not can not to react rapidly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the manager of the laboratory mobility and of the project car automated. 
it must react in knee-jerk and instantaneous, since this technology corresponds to the coat the most vulnerable and the most internal of l 'envelope of protection, a coat where for the instant the collision is considered unavoidable. 
whole This process must reflect what the bee makes to avoid the other bees. 
The process must take place in an allusion of eye. 
On the Other Hand of the bees, the difference can not go upwards, to the one low or in diagonal, it can be only of two dimensions, and only in the direction to which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, one has not been able to use only the rotary movement, the acceleration as the slowing down as to the available of the mini car robot 
The BR23C uses batteries Lithium polymer that are lighter and of which the concentrate of energy is bigger, what makes their lifetime longer than in the version lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primordial, not the treatment of the data, and still less the capacity for stocking. 
This mechanism must treat only some signals going by second, and has to react to these. 
It is not necessary of stocking them and of reacting with the intuitive logic basing from previous on the data itself. In this way, it uses only some dozen kilobytes of memory continues. 
One does not need memory of capacity gigabits, or even megabytes. 
It is the first step to the instant conception of a technology being used to the √©vitement. From after estimates of Nissan this system will make its entry in the cars produced in series in the ten next years. 
Another application could be his incorporation in the system of navigation by satellite GPS, so that it can guide the driver to its destination avoiding the obstacles being on his way. 
one has even given to the baby a name out of price 
The version written of the plan of economic rescue of 700 billion dollars, aiming at purchasing the dubious credits of the banks, and using in several times, is ready. 
At The first round half of this sum is going to be spent. 
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates prolonging themselves after midnight, Saturday, time local the East Coast is, the leaders of Congress have fallen of agreement on the controversies existing for days and days, around the plan of rescue of a total of 700 billion dollars. 
"we have carried out a serious not forward" - has declared Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American Bedroom of the representatives, according to which it does not remain more than to put the agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates for both presidential, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson, has declared commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme is going to work and will be efficient, however other measures must still be made use. Of after Pelosi, it is not question, here, of the rescue of Wall Street, but of making to turn the wheels of economy to the other sense. 
The written version of the plan has been made public before opening of the markets Asian, on Sunday night at 20 hr, local hour of Washington (it is - to say Monday at 2 hr of the morning, according to local time Europe Central), but has not caused spectacular ascent in the stock exchanges. 
Monday the House of Representatives will be the first to vote for the suggestion of law answering on behalf of Act for economic stabilization of urgency of the year 2008. Afterwards its fate will be between the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush has talked to Pelosi, then the House White also has greeted the news of agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the ones advanced attacks tonight, and we appreciate strongly the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets financial and to protect our economics" - has declared Tony Fratto the spokesman for the House White. 
Moreover the programme diverges of the initial suggestion made by the administration Bush, that it, mentioned that the 700 billion dollars had to be spent only in one time, for the purchase of the titles dealing with of loans dubious. 
Henceforth, maximum the half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of law by Congress probably on Monday. This first sum will serve for the secretary the Treasury to buy debts bad on banks, while use of 100 billion of dollars additional will be left to the discretion of the president. 
The programme will be supervised by an independent organism, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part also. 
The expense of the second half of the 700 billion depends on new decree of Congress. 
To Under the law the Secretariat the Treasury will be able to set up a combined strategy: he will, at the same time, be able to buy dubious beliefs, of the titles dealing with mortgages and mortgages dubious, as other types of "toxic" beliefs. 
The persons relevant of the ministry have declared that the takeovers can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule gives the possibility to the concerned societies, of taking part in a programme assurance, where the secretariat the Treasury guarantees the tools at origin of concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent damages predictable. 
Henry Paulson has declared that the law supplies the tools necessary in order to hallow 700 billion dollars for the needs urgent of the system financial, which it is a matter of the vast purchase of the beliefs dubious, of their insurance, or of avoiding the risk of seeing the system triggers collapse of one or the other important financial institution. 
"Us be going to take the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it" will be signed - it has added. 
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks finding stances in bad themselves and expecting the help from the State can expect to it that their allowances of departure, called quite simply gilded parachute beside - across the Atlantic, will be stagnated by the government. 
The capping of wages is mentioned only in case specific. Furthermore the restrictions depend on the way how the secretariat the Treasury proposes its aid to company. 
The principle of capping means that if the secretariat the Treasury purchases within the framework of an auction, they will take a surplus of tax from the parachute gilded, unless the president of bank discredited retires. 
Directly after the purchase of the debts bad the government will intervene in an aggressive way to check that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated. 
so that the picture is complete, it is needed nevertheless to add that the existent gilded parachutes are not modified. The capping concerns that the new contracts, this to motivate thus the participation to in the plan. 
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal limitations will be in force chief executive officers - has commented the president of the commission in load of the financial benefits of Parliament, the democrat Barney Frank. regarding the allowances 
Furthermore, the State obtains a right of acquisition of part in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way the risk of taxpayers reduces, since even they can be winner in the business as soon as the economics and with it the saved banks will fall on their legs. 
The bill mentions that in the five years to come, the President must introduce into the Conference a suggestion that will rule on the way the losses are going to be restored to the taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
From the two sides, there were those that have expressed their doubts in relation to this plan evidently. 
It is not for what the American citizens have appointed us, this does not protect the dollars from the taxpayers - has declared the member republican of California, Darrell Issa. 
Her colleague Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that it is the same that squeeze taking measures, that those persons in charge of collapse of Wall Street.

The review of the press of the German linguistic territory 
The camp of right is intact, it is only to the heart of the party that the voters have become more conscious - it is as evokes the Der Spiegel, the weak score of CSU in the country Bavarian. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black ones. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the internet edition of the magazine of information of German left, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article titled "The revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers". 
From after this recognized political scientist erosion of the CSU has begun well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber takes his duties. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed Bavaria for decades and maintaining, it is these same modern citizens that turn them their backs. 
This change is at the same time the problem of any Democracy Christian, and of this fact, also that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure has not been totally a surprise, but Sunday, has arrived eventually a process that was probable it is of that, all fair ten years: the indisputable hegemony of the party national has ended. 
It is of that ten years in 1998, the CSU curled up with 47,7 percent, and it for the first time since the 1950s, with a score in - underwear of the level of 50 percent. 
That had repeated three years ago during the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, in other words at that time of the so evoked Stoiber. 
The cause can be imputed to the modernization "devouring his parents", set up in the region in a solid way by the CSU. 
That makes 40 years that the sociologists announce that but they have strongly made a mistake regarding the pace. However the secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of German of the north and of the east in region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequences on the accuracy of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase of the opportunities, and the consequences of such policy are also visible. 
The camp of right is intact, it is only to the inside of the party that the voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn. 
It it is astonishing also that for these last weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens that are itself rather far from the CSU, such than the independent ones, the craftsmen, holders of the box and the holders of a diploma of higher studies. 
In these groups support the CSU has lowered below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his titled article "That? with whom? Preside over them of left are held itself on the reserve in view of to issues of the", the newspaper Austrian conservative is occupied of the situation of policy internal confused that has settled after the Austrian elections. 
The Socialists Austrian SP√ñ want to discuss with the conservatives of the √ñVP. 
The √ñVP forbids the SP√ñ to meddle in its affairs internal. 
The populist party BZ√ñ appears opened for negotiation. The greens do not want yet to start of agreement on the coalition. 
The elections have taken place, now everything turns around the coalition; during the debates organized on television public, the leaders of left have hardly to let glimpse their cards. 
Werner Faymann president of SP√ñ, has confirmed that it wanted to discuss with l '√ñVP. 
The SP√ñ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is possible indeed - it is what exists already in some regions and in the partnership socialist. 
The question according to which he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present president of her √ñVP, as vice-chancellor, remains opened on behalf of Faymann. 
As he has mentioned it, the direction Sch√ºssel-Molterer has, in any case, been thrown back. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molter has reacted with cautiously to the proposals of red. 
As he has already said it, a collaboration will be surely unfruitful if Faymann tries to interfere in the affairs internal of the √ñVP. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or of into the coalition is momentan√©ment a question quite open. These points absolutely must be discussed to the breast of the √ñVP. 
J√∂rg Haider, the president of the BZ√ñ, appears again open to all proposals. 
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black ones, we are ready to accept governmental responsibilities" - has declared Haider. 
J√°r√≥ka has declared: The vicious circle of the poverty and of the segregation must be broken 
Aujourd 'Today, has begun, in Paris, the European Summit for the Equality of the luck, whose host is France, as representative of the presidency current of Union European. 
In his message displayed in front of the plenary assembly, as one of the spokesmen - main words of the consultation of experts l√≠via j√°r√≥ka MEP before Fidesz party People's European, has attracted the attention on segregation in education, because it is a violation of the right that touches the more segregation children Roma and of this fact, one of the main brakes to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French presidency, this conference of high level has been opened on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and of the Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner responsible for the work, for the social affairs and for the equality of the luck. 
Among the people invited to take part in the consultation, one finds the partners social European, as the most eminent representatives of the legal protection and of the European civil organisms, in the domain of the equality of the luck. 
According to the office of press of the group of the member Fidesz party popular, J√°r√≥ka has warned that beside the distinctions noticed during the recruitment, the roms disappear from the market labour, in first place following their low. 
"An overwhelming majority young Roma do not possess diplomas of secondary, and due to an elementary education of poor quality, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a diploma from education higher. 
Besides, J√°r√≥ka has stressed the fact that the education as right basic of humans plays a key role while one must bring out other rights fundamental. 
The investment in the precocious education of early children Roma means a reinforcement of the economics of countries Union European. 
According to l'eurod√©put√©e, it is necessary to make to realize these relations in a widest circle possible, also between the roms and the non-roms. 
Indeed, the earlier an child Roma begins the school, the more it increases its chances to become a member productive of the market labour; by the taxes paid from his income and of his consumption, he participates in the budget of the State. 
"Throughout their nationality of Union European, the roms must be assured of their right to education to quality, and to be protected from an education of low quality and partisan." - L√≠via J√°r√≥ka has underlined. 
According to the deputy, a collaboration of the European Union directed to a goal and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For that, the respect of directives existing and in preparation is of a primordial importance. 
"The vicious circle of the poverty, of the segregation and of the unemployed person must be broken. to children need to give the possibilities assured by the democracy, so that they can partake as citizens of fullness of the Europe" - has required J√°r√≥ka. "straight in future" 
On behalf of the "European year for the Equality of the Luck" assured for everyone, the objective of the Summit for the equality of opportunities in Europe organized every year from the summit in Berlin last year, is of assuring a unique platform to support the measures taken in favor of the equality of the luck and for the fight against discrimination, aimed at the European level and at the level of the member countries. 
CSU: the grace for a period of transition 
It is in October that the decision dealing with the fate of the duo demeaned Huber-Beckstein will be made 
In spite of this pitiful election the head have not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal questions at to the summits CSU Bavarian has been adjourned. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the regional government, G√ºnther Beckstein, can still preserve their place. The question is of knowing up to when the grace will last? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a loss of catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be to the agenda of the conference of the exceptional party, held the final weekend of October. 
The members of this very criticized pair have, in any case, made to feel that they did not stem especially from their seats. 
Thanks to that, they have applied themselves to appeasing the furious members of the fraction and of the basis, who a day after the "bavarois tsunami" have required the consequences personal for the loss from the absolute majority. 
It is of that five years - it is true, still under the direction Edmund Stoiber, to at the summit his career - European Union took away 60,7 percent, while aujourd 'hui, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it remains only 43,4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years the CSU has been the "unique sovereign" of the Bavaria giving 18 percent of GDP. 
But, the conservatives count always strongly in this region of the south, of key importance for the Hungarian economics. At the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs readjustment interns of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also has received a place in this modest group of gratitude, which initiates discussions √† t√¢tons with of the liberals FDP, as with the Free Voters, formed along the values of right, about a possible coalition of the government of Munich. 
One foot of strange nose of the fate has been that to the help of the list of the Free Voters, enters to the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, of which the capture of measure against Stroiber has served as possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to treat afterwards very ambitious politician municipal without bluntly. 
Now the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or of another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which up to at present pulled the strings backstage, will receive also an role active. former head of the government regional and of the CSU, has referred on the 28 September as on the day the most bitter of his career talks about politics. 
Monday, Huber has launched a few remarks sharp to the CDU. According to it, they would have deserved much more support on behalf of the party sister. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
With reference to the elections Bundestag, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be able to be chancellor's wife if they only replace on foot in one way or of another, with a force joint the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hiding in a difficult way his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not influence negative way the grand coalition of Berlin. 
What nevertheless is relative because managing the hurt CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of always lasts. 
For 1946 the SPD has reached its worst results with 18,6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - his rivals: 
No member of opposition has reached to parliament after the elections of Sunday. 
Of after the observers Russian, that explains by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, who assures him prosperity and stability, while of after the Organization for the Safety and the Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), that explains by illegalities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections. 
although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants manages very well without opposition for many decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting his strengths under the name of Democratic Strengths Plain (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate of president for the fourth time during dubious elections, on the traces of the modification of the constitution in 2006, "would allow" this time the presence of some deputies from the opposition to in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ has renounced to her boycotts foreseen to the origin. 
The fact that the Belorussia, depending economically of more on top of Russia, would want to improve his relations with the EU, where because of the Belorussian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several politicians senior placed do not receive of visa entry, was one of the expectations opposition. Belarus has of the to take a credit because of the reduction of, of in imports gas natural Russian always more expensive, and has contributed thus at the same time of the society Beltransgaz, owner of the canals of gas crossing the country, has passed to the hands of the Russian ones. 
Is it that the OSCE, during evaluation the campaign, has put the accent on the positive changes rather than on breaches, as for example the ban to present candidates to the opposition itself for a third, referred to a appeasement prior. 
However, the communiqu√© of the OSCE of Monday contested already the campaign, during which the main part of candidates for opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the deprivation of votes. 
In spite of all that, the opposition feels all the same an improvement palpable in regime political: the political prisoners have found the freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontation with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the Oss√©tie of the south and the Abazzia separated from Georgia. Yet, the Russia with whom Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for already a month. 
"we have made two steps forward, and one not backward, but the most important is that the dialogue has been begun between Belarus and the EU" - has declared Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
From after the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that remains thus, although "the power has had afraid in this parliament that does not have any weight, of making even one opponent go." 
The opposition does not foresee actions of protests considering of the results. She tries rather to make arrive his message on the necessity of economic reforms next to the voters. 
"Of course, we have concern in this: we must make to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us of the sticks in the wheels with regard to the spread, but I can notice also that they are more and more to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly aged" - has declared Milinkevich, referring by the way that in the present system of Lukashenko, who considers the social insurance as its main outcome, lays down it of pensioners the more supported officially does not consider it appropriate. 
"Because of the indebtedness of the country and of the rise of the commercial deficit the Security of, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is not more than a question of time" - value Milinkevich. 
Contrary to the politician of the opposition, the Russian observers have qualified the elections of democratic. 
Serguei Lebedev, directing of the Commonwealth from the Independent States, has declared Ria Novosti to news Russian of: "The people do not believe in the words, but in deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is only the proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters. 
Brunetta: "From aujourd" hui breakfast before the work ". 
Never, in the history of the Palace Chigi, not had of the revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from 'aujourd' today, is in force this new measure against small smart, against whom points and afterwards is going to drink the coffee at the bar for working hours. 
The novelty anti- loafers has been presented aujourd 'hui by the minister of Administration Public for Brunetta, and by the secretary general of the presidency of the Advice, Mauro Masi. 
¬´ the ¬ª revolving ¬´ doors - tells Brunetta- are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more of attendance and more of services "precise the minister. 
Now begin a new season of accountability and transparency. 
"It is the reform underlines moreover Brunetta. 
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Advice is completed with the Palace Chigi. 
According to Masi, "the choice of the revolving doors is important even of a point of view symbolic. 
No resistance from employees has been recorded, insures the secretary general: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of everyone". 
In short, more of small breakfast for working hours; more coffee nor more. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 hr of the morning is an excellent and salubrious resolution". 
During a conference at the Superior School of the public Administration 
of Rome the minister communicates that '"' in three months, the absences of illness of employees public have been reduced of 50%, or hard-working 60milles of more in a year". 
And it adds that it is essential to make more efficient, the Public Administration. 
Italian, "of which" the salary dynamics - explains the minister - these 8 - 10 last years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well beside the rates of inflation. 
At the same time thousands employees public, have united to contest the norms of the decree Brunetta making use to the Codacons. 
"during that the minister of the Civil Service spreads aujourd 'hui the data regarding the fall of the absenteeism on the workplace for cause of illness - written language the association of the consumers - the people of the" idlers active "continue increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, of the thousand employees of the Public Administration correct and productive, have met to declare the war to the illegitimate norms contained in the decree. 
In particular, at the Tar, one contests the exclusion of additional allocations in the event of injury due to on duty; the extension of the timetables domiciliary permanence of the ill worker, during which the visits of inspections, as of other aspects contained in the new arrangements wanted by the minister are carried out. 
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention" 
Every day, in Italy, one counts 2500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain disabled in a permanent way. 
In 2007, the data Inail confirm indeed, that the deaths white have been about 1.200. 
Numbers that reveal the gravity of the phenomenon that remains one of the causes main of death, and causes nearly two times more of deaths than the murder. 
To have the attention of institutions, of the forces social and of the means of information on this aspect, the Anmil celebrates aujourd 'hui, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th national Day of the victims of accidents on the work, institutionalized the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying data broadcast by the Anmil, as tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of Prevention in the workplace", asserts the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the president of the Anmil, Association National of mutilated and invalids of the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head expresses his "sincere appreciation for the associative continuous effort in favor of the prevention on the workplace, the protection of workers injured, the assistance to families of victims and public raise awareness" of the public opinion " 
"naturally incensed, everybody has struck of the fists to put a term to such tragedies that, throughout their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the involvement of public, even if the daily reality presents dramatic, even repetitive cases to us in their dynamic. 
Napolitano does not hide that there is a matter of resources probably: it is essential of investing in the training and the information " 
The numerous initiatives promoted in the sector school, accept a very particular importance for an awareness more direct on behalf of the youths that enter to the world of work. 
It is of our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluating the alarm on the serious social, applying and improving the standards legislative. 
Of its part, the president of the house Gianfranco Fini has underlined to the how much this phenomenon of deaths white constitutes an emergency social absolute, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes to all the institutions, of making exhaustive a concrete effort aiming at putting to it rapidly ". 
The data of the ones damaged on the work seem to signal a slight trend positive, but that does not avoid that nevertheless the number of dead white is impressive "has underlined ulteriorly the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"we do not wish that this" tendency "to the discount" him translates in fact, in a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes itself, which happens the tragedy. 
"we believe that in general, one does not make enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be carried out thanks to numerous actions." 
¬´ According to us has underlined Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are essentials, all as an intervention more important on the training of the workers, and this, from the school. 
it has added - "that" still an effort must be made in what concerns the communication and public raise awareness. 
"But it is needed especially, a greater sense of the responsibilities on behalf of the employers in view of a phenomenon that represents a social urgency." 
¬´ Mercandelli afterwards has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of maintenance of the compensation foreseen for victims of work" and the "drift" of assistance to which the system directs itself in recent years ". 
¬´ The objective therefore, is of returning the worker the guarantee of assurance - it has added - in order to it that the fate of the one that has an accident, must not depend on the spontan√©isme or on the broadening of the legislator " 
MP3 Mp3 pointed of the finger, they put to risk the hearing. 
Listening to music to the maximum volume for an extended period using devices music portable such as the readers Mp3, can cause damage permanent to hearing. 
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communiqu√© broadcast in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the scientific Committee, on the sanitary risks unexpected and lately identified (Csrseri) of the EU, announces published aujourd 'today. 
"of this scientific relation - we read in the bill - him goes out again that 5 - 10 percent of those that, for a period at least 5 years, listen to music to the maximum volume using portable musical devices, for more than one hour by day and by week, risk a loss permanent the capacity hearing. 
"I am worried at the fact that a number also important of youths that use frequently devices music portable and mobile telephones to the maximum volume, can damage unconsciously their hearing in irreparably vis-√†-vis" asserts Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to the scientific data - pursues the person in charge Ue- it is a matter of a risk clear and we must react rapidly. 
What counts the more ones is of sensitizing the consumers and giving back these information from domain public. 
we must re-examine moreover, the existent systems of control considering the scientific opinion, in order to what they are totally efficient and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels has asked to the independent scientific Committee, of examining the problem, considering intensive of devices music portable and the increase of the number of youths exposed to the noise that these generate. 
"The scientifiques-conclue the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons of worrying, and that the European Commission will examine now with the Member States and other parties interested, what measures could possibly be adopted to protect better the children and the adolescents, against the exposure to the noise coming from music portable devices and similar devices. 
There is a European norm of safety that limits the level of noise of the portable musical devices at 100Db already, but the anxiety increases as for the auditory damages that could stem from an excessive exposure to such sources of noise. 
Well limiting these data making resort to solutions as the reduction of the levels and of the duration of exhibition to noise is possible. 
The scientific Committee EU made notice that the users of devices music portable, which listen to music to the maximum volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, go too far presently in force relative to the level of maximum noise consented on of the workplace. 
Those that listen to music in such conditions for extended periods, risk a permanent loss of the ability hearing after 5 years. 
That interests 5 - 10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to the surroundings of 2,5 and 10 a million people in the U.E. 
Rome, Alemanno has given the order to make to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Aujourd 'Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will pull are them. 
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the works of the "Major commission" for the future of Rome ", which has taken place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the 49 of them other components of the Commission will design the directives for Rome. 
In March when they will have finished, the Committee and the Council City will evaluate the analyses and the projects, in order to present in June, the strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and of his mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The commission is absolutely independent; all the ideas political, social and cultural with it are represented - holds to underline Alemanno- it will have to propose of the ideas of development of Rome whose political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council City, will be able to help themselves. 
Any combination of roles, but uniquely the will of having a corner to elaborate a large project as Rome. 
In March, it will have finished its tasks and will disappear afterwards, because this experiment must have a period time specific. 
In June - announcement the mayor - us will present the strategic plan stemming from the work realized by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. 
For those that accuse the Commission of being useless, considering that its opinions will not be constraining, Alemanno replies ": Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be capable of making, as on the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is to it, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as of elsewhere in Rome, I am on, his contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and of the urgency that appears from time to time. 
Us, on the contrary, we want to see of the front, and further, to a deeper futurology, working seriously on the development of Rome and of his future. " 
Moreover the mayor of Rome insists on underlining that "this Commission is not a body useless or a whole bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the roman city-dwellers, and will use to study and to make the best participate intelligence that expresses the Capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, a skeleton reference key or firm or immobile, is needed in order to allow to our city, of improving, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about his future maintaining a spirit unity ". 
One future that, clarifies the mayor of Rome, will not "confine to the usual borders local, but that will look further ¬ª not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and of its status legal of capital," but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and" must have, as Capital of Europe and of the Mediterranean ". 
Obama? the first president anti-American. 
This is why. A famous American politician who insists on being taken for independent, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, which, of share its decisions, destroyed the economics US and had reports (as of elsewhere it has always aujourd 'today as a citizen private) with the Islam enemy. 
The attacks against Obama increase even though the date of the elections approaches. 
A lady of Miami has written on a website site: "this person is full of ambition". 
Obama is really cheeky: he believes that it will win the highest duty of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five senators black "! 
In reality, it is a matter of attacks that do not say much; they are evidently attacks by nature racial, and do not reply to the question of all voters: will he be a good president? Moreover we have the surveys, who declare everyone that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In that case - here, it is still a matter of quelqu 'one that speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississipi, in the entrails of the south of the United States, has written an article: a time in the booth voting, we know well to whom the Patriot American will give his vote. 
This is that emerges an aspect of the mentality American maintained secret until at the end. 
"Said what you want, we will see ourselves even of putting the cross, on Obama or on McCain. 
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave from the United States. 
Things ever revealed up to now, so much so that the success of the candidate black seems nearly certain. 
Anyway, in spite of all these arguments, the winning card for the democrats is George Bush. 
one has asked to 1500 people: what have been the mistakes committed by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent has replied: 
the Iraq. 
America changes. To the Vietnam this nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent back to her place to kicks to the buttocks. 
In Iraq 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the American ones have not been forced to pack. 
In spite of that, the Iraq has been, for the majority, the point of weakness of Bush. 
who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to fulfill. 
Wore away, the economic collapse makes to itself to feel even by the journalists: in the press, it is the hour of the deletions. And a lot undergo Internet, this "murderer" of the paper newspaper. 
Five hundred journalists Americans have been called out to by the PEW Research Center about the statute of their profession and control mental for the future. 
And well, almost all journalists are aujourd 'today pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not declared openly to the attached information, to feel less worried about the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as in the past. 
The problem of journalists American, it is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model. 
Moreover, the suppression carried out in the newsroom, in the room where the authors work on the assembling of the newspapers, is a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if l 'one wish that the traditional journalism such as the general public hears it, is not reduced itself in a consistent way. 
An evident but complex pessimism invades the American journalism. 
Six on ten senior executives and journalists of newspapers of printing are convinced of journalism at level national being following a bad way. 
Locally the group executive is in 65%. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
The journalists do not have hard to see where the web goes. 
The greatest publisher houses clear a passage to Internet, perceived by a lot as "the murderer" of paper newspaper, for themselves. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists feel has increased up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to start the technology hoping that it "makes something of good" for their journalism. 
Aujourd 'Today, the greatest tear in the American journalism resides between whom lead the newsrooms- it is - to call the managers - and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at level national, are convinced of the reporters sharing their values, even though at the local level, this percentage goes down to 23%. 
For certain, that is related to the "safety of the work". 
The managers who intend to lose their workstation in area of 3 years, are of 47% at the national level. 
In what concerns the journalists, one goes to 30%. 
That of the "sure work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always to the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a nation huge as Wore away them, with 300 million inhabitants and the thousand journalists, seen again, radio, telly and Internet, the employers offer often it that they want, and that it becomes rapidly a quick question to set or to leave. 
The directors receive nearly always big salaries, even though the editor can win 10mille dollars by month, beside the retirement and the payment of insurance. 
As for the holiday, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, until at 15 days in everything, passed a number years. 
But, according to their revelations journalists Americans, are often "patients" for the year. 
It is the for want of the climate. 
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS TO GROTTAFERRATA. 
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to throw back the authority of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, that had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
Coppola is held an inquiry for bankruptcy within the framework of the instruction relative to the climbing Unipol-Bnl. 
During the trial to his burden, last week, it had obtained the domiciliary release transformed into compulsory residence at Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go over the journey of the city of province to a home in the capital. 
According to the court, such movements (who the pm has not brought together) would allow him to influence its society and to have access to the proofs that accuse it. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already appeared a few before, with the vote of the House of Representatives, opposite as regards rescue of 700 billion dollars approved of by the White House: a good number of American was, and is it still, more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the American economics. 
And it is well the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it to us communicating that the present crisis divides the party Republican, still more divided between his Eve soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to institutions federal thus that to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the States of the Center and of the South. 
The soul, precisely, which has made to smell in a despotic way with the vote that I talked to you about initially. 
However what has just been quoted is one example of changes, of the great changes that the earthquake economic ongoing pre-announces or well leaves already to run: not only to the United States, but in the whole West, and can be not only that here. 
In The States United as in Europe the crisis seems to make to accelerate the phenomena cocooned for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves. 
The first of these phenomena is the updating the revival extraordinary, of the double category Etat- sovereign, in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economics. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of institutions banked - financial that have, evidently of close relations with abroad, but that, above all, are implied on a large scale, records of individuals and families that live only in one Country, only in a single state. 
That creates immediately a political problem for whom governs it: it is to say as replying to the difficulties and to the protests of individuals and of the families that moreover are an electorate. 
In short the crisis appears economically mondiale but politically, it is nearly only here national. 
The political internationalization seems really offside or well, does not have little to say: the evidence to us is supplied by the European Union that, shared as habit, between the diverse interests and between the various strategies national, does not manage to decide any lines common. 
And thus, it is from the government every state of that everyone expect interventions, of the plans of rescue and of recovery the new rules, and especially a affection: when one crosses a difficult period, there are only the States that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to replace the things in place. 
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimization to use them: two resources invaluable, of the elements of which no market nor international organization never will be able to have analogous way. 
This new bombast of the crisis nation-state is of the rest in perfect harmony with importance always major that the economic developments more recent of the economics tend to attribute to a factor quite to this point: 
the territoriality. Paradoxically, indeed, even though we were persuaded to henceforth have entered to the kingdom of the network, of the always more sophisticated technology, of the not material one, convinced of the globalized finance being henceforth destined to dominate the world, we have surrendered account of a blow of one alone, that our future will on the contrary have to settle its account always more with the little enough material things as the water, the harvests the oil. 
Things that can probably be transported from a place at another of the earth, but that are bound in an absolute way to a space delimited, at a territory. 
Thus, who is sovereign, possesses probably more cards than the one that is not it, it is - to - statement, the one that has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I arrive now to the second novelty that however foresees a fracture. 
Who said Territoire, unavoidably said State, Government, Talks about politics, and therefore leadership. 
To this consideration The crisis economic seems to cause two phenomena converge. 
Of one quoted, the conscience of the objective need of leadership authoritarian, the research of a person who knows to take the situation en main. 
Of the quoted other one, a wave of discredit for the supremacies existent, species economic that have revealed inadequate and full of zone of shade. 
And moreover, something still deeper, in some sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, a picture of unsuitability, a feeling of removal that tends to involve the class whole of directors in an increasing number of countries of. 
Thus increases still more the conviction of various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites up to now to their apogee, their way of listening and of being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have same time, and to be always more foreign to the opinions of the majorities. 
in short, asks for It of leadership, feeds with way subterranean, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimated of the ruling classes and of the traditional political orders, which appear in the improvised electoral "revolts" or well, in the changes d whims collective of recent very recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the Labor Party members in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American delegates against Bush (and it would be able itself although the victory of the right in Italy has not happened by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties their programmes, but also their rites their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals their format, would say quelqu 'one, have always more difficulty, what does not date back to aujourd' today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep coats of the western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, that it increases and that it shakes potentially in an excessive way. 
In full view of all that, to talk about a present "rebellion of the masses" to the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated. 
But one says well, to keep the eyes big open, that is not without reason. 
The superglue to walk on the walls. 
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, to walk on the walls as Spiderman. 
This is the objective of various centres research Americans, and aujourd 'today, a team of four institutes has as it nearly succeeds. 
With an adhesive measured barely 2.5 cm2, the researchers have succeeded in maintaining stuck a body of 100 kg on a wall vertical. 
THE STUDY - The American review Science has published the discoveries of some researchers of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those that we know that use a particular structure of the carbon, called nano tubes of carbon. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang du Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta. 
The scientists the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to assure, have inspired a perfect adherent. 
The tests carried out on diverse materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the paper glass, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that him ¬´ is untied itself easily of the wall "explains Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton. 
WALKING ON THE WALLS? - "that material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai. 
can be to walk on the walls as Spiderman? can be that yes, but the researchers think about a much less fascinating use such as the connection between appliances electronic, considering that the nano tubes of carbon are drivers of heat and of electric charge. 
Other applications could concern the aerospace engineering. 
For the Moment, not super hero. 
THE OTHER RESEARCH - THE University of Berkeley, in California, is dedicated it also, in search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the American review American Chemical Society researchers California have presented an adhesive formed of microfibres as hair, that him car cleans of the dusts during the movement on an area to guarantee a perfect and constant grip. 
Medicines: never with juices fruit. 
Attention to the juice of grapefruit, of orange and of apple. 
These drinks, consumed especially the summer because quenching thirst and wealthy persons in vitamins, so associated with some medicines vital, alter the absorbement amplifying or diminishing according to the case their effectiveness, with the consequences same serious for health. 
David Nailey a professor at University of the Ontario Western in London, reminds the risks of the juices of fruits that they are, limps or costs, so associated to him ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway to Philadelphia, it throws a new alarm: it suffices of a glass of juice of grapefruit, of orange and of apples, to reduce the absorbement of some medicines vital, canceling their beneficial effects and putting to risk the health of patients. 
The juice of grapefruit already strongly has been criticized because reserved responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines anti arythmiques, antibiotic, tranquilizing, anti staminal and neurological, jusqu 'at the levels toxic. 
MEDICAMENTS HAS IT RISKS is the Italian Agency of the medicine it even who had given the news in a bulletin of information dated of two years alerting the doctors and patients to not under evaluating the danger stemming from it mix and to mind to it that l 'one drinks, if one takes of the drug as for example, the Diaz√©pam or the methadone. 
NOT THAT THE GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, even the juice of orange and of apple contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the list of the inhibited active principles by the grapefruit and the other juice. 
Of there, the call of Michele Carruba, manager of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately signaled to the diverse national and international agencies of medicines that will owe if necessary, to change the notes informative from the medicines. 
He admits always to reading the illustrative papers of the medicines that 'l' one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to make itself to impress, but to appeal clearly to the doctor or to the pharmacist "has underlined expert at agency Ansa. 
The Nobel of the economics in Paul Krugman. 
The price Nobel of the economics has been attributed to the American one Paul Krugman for his investigations on the models of trade and on the location of activity economic. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a neo-Keynesian that teaches to the University of Princeton and moreover he is a famous editorial writer of The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greatest criticisms of the solutions in economy and foreign policy of the administration Bush. 
Some months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more determining than the first, in term of consequences on history of the United States. 
A forecasting that unleashed numerous debates, and for which the economist was reproached for years, but that now has revealed itself exact. 
"I am surprised and even a bit am shocked of the speed with which the memory the scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, have disappeared the attention of the public" had declared Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the committee executive's Bank Central European, Krugman is one "economist of great value", but also a divulgator to the style "very aggressive, particularly criticism to the excesses of the liberalism of the administration Bush. 
Open Office that is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft" 
It is on the day of the diffusion of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims at touching always and still more of users, from the Home to the office, of professionals to administration public, proposing an alternative free to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
With reference to a work of almost a year, realized by voluntary developers, watched by SUN Microsystem, the new package open office appears to the general public with various innovations: of the screen of welcome, and the interface revised and become less austere, to others more important, than the compatibility born for the op√©ratif system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 the latest version standard ISO. 
Open Office has minded particularly the interaction with the continuation Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx. 
Also interesting, some specific duties at some modules, as the one that allows reducing the dimensions of the presentations PowerPoint, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to be important of the line PDF in the module of graphic elaboration, preserving the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this forehead, it is possible to create documents "PDF hybrids" that united the typical diagram of the Adobe format with the elements of a leaf of calculation or of winemaker of text. 
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements inside the applications: in the map various users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts on the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, because to each employee is attributed a color of comments for a better gratitude in phase the review. 
Some companies even are working to take some duties of OpenOffice on the Web (one the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should emit the outcome final. 
The Italian version is dischargeable at the http address: / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday. 
Beside to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available moreover, for the op√©ratif system Linux. 
On request, the cd of installation can to be sent to home or on the workplace. 
And if the subject of the charge can be a way to broadcast it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the following is the great challenge, being able already to count on diverse projects realized in the public administration and the schools. 
Without counting the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and of assistance, ideal for the small ones and attracted averages, which would be able of elsewhere to open to the vanguard of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing are tantamount of Word; Calc, is the leaf of calculation that aims at replacing Excel; Impress, for the presentations rival of PowerPoint; Dbase, such the famous Access, is the program that allows working on the databases; finally Drwa is the module graphic. 
Target for 2008, to arrive at 5 million download, and considering that aujourd 'today one counts almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is probable that with the exit of the new version, even one can exceed the predicted number 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth of doping. 
New case of positivit√© at the last Tour de France: it is a matter of the Austrian of the qualified team Gerolsteiner Bernhard Kohl, third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber. 
It is the site of the day-to-day 'Team that reports the news. 
To 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist to the Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian ones Riccardo Ricc√≤ and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, them also of Gerolsteiner. 
The fiery analyses carried out on the test tubes of Kohl are part of those realized these last weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the positivit√© to the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place to in the round and will owe forcing to discount two years elimination. 
The news of the positivit√© of Kohl to the Epo of third generation, has been confirmed by the leader of the French agency anti doping, Pierre Bordry, that has communicated with Associated Press, to have notified the review to the authorities Austrian. 
The Austrian of 26ans has placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American one Cadel Evans, swiping thus the singlet to peas the best climber. 
IMMIGRATE: NEW YORK TIMES WONDERS IF ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy "as Country of immigrants lately has transformed into a destination favored for the immigrants" received with reluctance. 
Would that transform the Beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is on that sec 'int√©roge the New York Times that has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of the racism in Italy, leaving from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating from Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, to have stolen one limps of biscuits. 
This case brings what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north" to the fore: Northern regions are at the same time those where l 'one register "more integration and more work", but also "one feeling anti-immigrants the strongest of the country and most important support for the League Northern" 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrated, the NYT has also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
not only. 
Even the new legislature wanted by the league to slow down the immigration and to facilitate the expulsion of the secret ones, is quoted as proof of the change of climate in Italy. 
Tendency underlined by the Pope as by President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Sanctimonious XVI to the Quirinal, has asked to what the State and the Church work together to defeat the racism." 
Students victims of the expensive rents, up to at 900 euros for a house. 
The market of lettings students not know not crisis 
According to the last inquiry of the Sunia the union of tenants, to rent a house simple can cost to a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon henceforth has reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories from young, of the right to the study because of the very high global costs that the families of origin must support - explains the person in charge of the research department of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students so has distorted the market that a process of generalized increase is amorc√©m√™me itself for the residents. 
Moreover, in most of the cases the tender hire comprise a series of violations: contracts of free type, not recorded, without limit of rent, subletting. 
For the Sunia, of the extraordinary interventions by the intermediary of review of taxation needed are to soothe the prices. 
Reading the inquiry in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the zone Brianza, 450 euros are needed about; for a house simple, one goes of 450 euros minimum (area Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Will Trust) to a maximum of 650 euros (area Vittoria) 
In Florence a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, the house around 700 euros. 
In Bologne, where the students concentrate in areas close to university 250 / 280 euros are needed for a bed in a double one, and of 370 to 500 for a house simple. 
In Rome, in the zones nearby of the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks for about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Values slightly lower (550 euro for a simple) for the zones nearby of the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt√†). 
one can not save l 'one sec' moves away in peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the zone Predestina, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed 300 are needed / 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, one spends of 400 to 600 euros, with prices higher in the zones Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
To Bari, for bed, 250 must be counted / 250 / 350, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the towns smaller, the prices are lower in term absolute, but they have a major importance in the urban economics. 
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, in which the kind of letting are often taken by students foreign, one records an ulterior anomaly: the rent asked to the foreign students for is increased of 25 / 30% by compared to that applied to the Italian ones. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities wear the historical rooms. 
The cinemas historical close in favor of the Multiplex Systems. 
"a city without cinemas is a city blind, it is as a face without" 
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what he passes to itself in the large centres urban Italians, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth in periphery of the great multirooms, and the death of consumption of the mono rooms in areas central of cities, is one of the major events that appears inescapable and unquestionable to us; it has besides all the characteristics a true crime cultural. 
To disappear, they are often of places historic and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, quelqu 'one that one knows," with which we have shared a way and so many emotions "observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore him there 20 years, the first Oscar as the Grand Prix of the juror of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a room of province, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost can be forever. 
The numbers supplied by Anec, the main association of the storekeepers, want every statement: the last five years 316 cinemas of kind traditional have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have especially paid the price: 10 of less in Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most touched by the closing, the Emilie Romaine is in mind with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, steady by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The proof that confirms you that the first responsible for their disappearance is the accession of the multiplex system, because it is well the three Italian regions that have recorded the more new multiroom cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy these five last years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilie-Romagne. 
"The Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observe Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "him is useful of building new structures, but it would be needed to guarantee all the same the survival of those that exist already, because when a room closes in a city, these fr√©quenteurs are not inevitably everyone disposed to go to the multiplex systems. 
Without talking about the missed deliberation of credit for traders: the antecedent debt of the State is of about 10 million euros. 
It is shameful that, of an ethical and moral viewpoint, the Government does not respect the laws existing. 
To support the industry, it would be needed between 16 and 18 a million euros per annum. 
let's notice the case of Bologne, the first city Italian that, worried at these closures, has decided to solve the situation thanks to the signature of a protocol between Town Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and to promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historical centers and in periphery. 
Among the predicted normative ones, there are measures of fiscal easiness in favor of managers and advantages for the public in term of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter to the zone to limited circulation, and will have special prices for parking spaces and in some car parks. 
"It is an initiative that me very fond observe" Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that of other cities will follow the example of Bologne setting up other measures. 
It however it is evident that, to contrast the super power of the multiplex systems, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of his and of the picture, because the public of aujourd 'today is more require. 
The defence of cinema traditional is a topic that for me, always has been important: the closing of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has persuaded me to make of cinema traditional Paradiso "to which I thought already for 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, henceforth closed, there where I have lived so much on divided emotions, I turn of the other one quoted not to see the signs be blackened by the dust. 
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta, stopped mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
¬´ The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed to standardize the choices of the Town Hall to the interests of the clan Piromalli. 
heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the anti-mafia Direction of the Calabria, to the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, stopped this morning for advertised externally for association Mafia. 
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the mediatory antiques between the clan and the public administrations, and his small lawyer son, homonym of the boss, already sentenced for association of criminal type Mafia, as to pay 10 million euros. 
an insult to the normative ones legal and moral, and especially of the right direction "write the prosecutors, the two authorities local had expressed the will of paying Master Piromalli consultations. 
"Thus one would have been brought together to the clan - the judges write - of entering officially at the inside of the town halls facilitating possibilities already considerable, of control and of orientation of the public administration" 
The president of committee regional Calabrian Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusion between the committees local and the organized crime, there is there more than one" in its region: "there are places where the Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is nearly unavoidable. 
But there are many politicians who resist to the pressures also of the ndrangheta, of the heroes who are honest " 
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with reference to which the police announced to have beheaded the clan Piromalli. 
From the end last April, the local advice of Gioia Tauro had been dissolves; already in 1991, and always because of conditioning presumed between the organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been unloaded of their duty of administering the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the moment of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a coalition of right center, after of the run-off May 2006. 
He cried to the scandal when the prefecture organized the dissolution of the Council City. 
It accused the vice minister of the inside at that time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having plotted the whole for a political question, but considering the request of imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the clan Piromalli had even succeeded to ask for the variation of in the draft the A3. 
Leaving from the interceptions organized against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerged "the availability to marry the particularities of a man of businesses representative a group best known, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan. 
when the energy is born of the waves, now the big launch. 
This is an excessive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and maintaining the big companies global energy are discovering it. 
Waves, currents, tides, this is the new sources renewable on which of the behemoths as Chevron have put the eyes, and maintaining try of putting their hands there. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements from the sea is studied for henceforth a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in the connection with first crisis oil, the research have intensified. 
When the price of oil lowered, to 1980, the idea to exploit the sea energy was left aside, but now the bodies environmentalists and the new increase in the oil give a big boom to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has valued in 2007, which 15% of need global electricity could be covered by systems of exploitation of the swell of the seas. 
This amount would be the copy of the one that the nuclear central ones produce. 
And besides, the currents and the tides. would be. 
Behemoths in attack. 
The first firm to bet on the sea energy has been the Enersis, who in 2005, has sigl√© an agreement to build an installation to the north of Portugal. 
When the harmony was announced, one would have called a true one not revolutionary. 
At two years of that, always candidates amongst these companies dedicated for always to the traditional energy bet on the sea energy. 
"Chevron studies presently the technologies on the oceanic energy - has declared the spokesperson of a company associated with the Colossus tanker American, to the economic daily Wall Street Journal- and she evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us". 
The cooperation in question, concerns the obtainment of a deliberate license by the American commission for the energy, navy, necessary to give rise to a project of exploitation of the energy, in Alaska. 
This is a signal very interesting, especially if l 'one consider that precisely in Alaska, Wore away them continue extract of the oil, and lately President Bush has set up a project for new excavations 
Beside to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and Ocean Power du New Jersey, who go over the way of the energy coming of the sea, and are invested them up to aujourd 'today, although their details are not known, indicate according to observers a interest growing. 
Tecnologie to put at point. 
The experts still talk about a technology at his beginnings, part the fact that the energy marinates does not dissipate the fears to the ecological impact. 
At present, the systems as those of Portugal, or some in Scotland, are of small size, and do not seem to create big problem in ecosystem. 
To cause energy on a large scale, however of technology must be used with a superior ecological impact. 
"and the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected ones to the others. 
The surge of waves, which makes to move the sludge upwards and the bottom, a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders to inside the cork is converted. 
The pressure makes to turn a turbine that successively, feeds a creator. 
The energy is sent at the shore through cables under sailors. 
For the instant, we have four systems of this kind in phase project, in the waiting of a single approval federal and a part energy could be used to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, produces already from energy for a centre commercial and a car park using six turbines under sailors of East River in New York. 
The movement of water the Tides, made turn the blades from the turbines, creating a rotatory movement that feeds a creator. 
Verdant has announced to have a long list of customers on standby of the authorizations necessary to draw energy. 
After the waves tides. 
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Research of electricity, deserves at the moment the potential of tides. 
although it is a matter of an intermittent phenomenon the oil is more predictable of the wind, of the sun, or of the waves, and therefore more reliable than source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coast, have surrounded 7 million and half one of dollars in 2008 and foresee investments up to at 35 million in 2009.
