Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owners
Scneelose runways are not only the giant mountains in the vicinity.
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment to the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
That is why in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New year's eve.
Our pages are often visiting them.
The people of the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to.
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "to see" will be led by the operators of the information portal spindl. info, Martin jandura.
Who the New Year's Eve - stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, no longer wants to be with the appointment of hesitation.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners are now for the New year's day mostly just weeks stays.
I think that they will seek to sell them, but then they must also give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room quickly wane, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the Ingtours travel agent in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half the seats are still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas to prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents ingtours, Petr schiefert.
The New year's day in Giant can offer the Vrchlabi travel, but there are fewer free seats.
Good (the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by the fact that in Giant always no snow.
People are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes within a week of snow, will also be sold off the Christmas Schiefert, says.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, manages to fill the room in the hotel in Pecpod snezkou.
We are around five percent better than in the previous year.
On New year's Day and Christmas, we have only a few free rooms.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in the Janua, and in February, will run the business well informed, the director of the best PEC-hotels, Karel Rada.
80 per cent for the New Year's Eve visits is also the Omnia Hotel in the central car park in Janske Lazne occupied.
At Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we currently have around 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker since the february, but at the moment when the snow, is the interest in the placements in giant, the director of the hotels omnia, Erik sporysch.
Wait for a greater snow Mess the Giant - hotel owners in the meantime.
On Thursday, it was cool and if it rains, the snow on the mountains.
But then again, a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech office in Hradec kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of the intelligence
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in afghanistan, he himself for the dümmsten.
When he finally his gaze longingly awaited Afghanistan doctrine ausschwitzte, it emerged that he is on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Iraq scenario for three years ago.
Not only that, several times in the text itself, the phrase "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "new way forward", used without hesitation.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq to send - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months, but that the recommendations of the military, Bush strategy is the only possible and was very successful in the sense that there is no longer in the news about iraq.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because he has left his successor with a much Dankbarere situation objectively, as it was to be expected.
In afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent of troops have asked him again the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, even despite the subordination protecting habits the vacillating harshly criticized in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President for three months, but no better idea and he has betrayed the General wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From europe, he has the promise for a further 5,000, even if he was at least 10,000.
Highly problematic about The Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine has left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders pay tribute to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation, it can rely on no one and no agreements.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correct, remain just a veneer of buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions of the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his charitable
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated further, and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers broke out in the bellicose language on the "Frühheimkehr" create a miracle, can only be a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians can and want their voters does not explain in what way the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush mountain vorland - is connected.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also have a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only sop for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and, therefore, there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls would prove this as a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses in cash bonuses
The chief executives of the us bank Goldman Sachs will receive no bonuses this year in more in cash.
The company has announced that responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers get stock instead of the money, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be stripped of the managers in the case, if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs is in accordance with the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts to the premium of Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction in which it has to go, the former bankers society's, Douglas elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism, having for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion in premiums.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today, despite the measure likely exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a series of LaNders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to exceed the bonuses of bankers, the £25,000, with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

It is thought that the budget, and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet in the issues of the day meeting will be.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On another will remain in his role will be Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget bill, now Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals for money, and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, mr Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is a sharp domestic political dispute, transformed the question mark over the future work of the fishermen officials cabinet, on which the ODS and CSSD and Green Party in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by parliament, the package of austerity measures, which of the fish 'government in the autumn, and the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have been neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which rely on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr necas, said the CTK that the concept of cabinet officials with the support of the cssd, ODS and Green party seems no longer works.
Prime minister Fischer described in the drafting of similar words as a "strong worry".
The CSSD leader, Jiri paroubek, responded to the Topolanek said that the budget deficit is terrible that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion kronor.
Wednesday, CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "invictus: the ungeschlagene" the world shows much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was filled by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson mandela, is in his life history of the American oscar actor Morgan freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film.
A further important role, matt damon.
I said to him: "if I play, I must take.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the East Wood from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has become the slave owners, a fictional us president, and also in "evan Allmächtig", but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as mandela.
The former South African leader was for his active career in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years, he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he is
The film recounts a true story in The Nelson Mandela his forces with The captain of The South African rugby team, Francois pienaar, leading to The country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically divided.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players, among the outsiders, some in the world.
Finally, the South African team is growing up in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years in order to bring the Mandela - history on the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role, this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, with him to dinner and before his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake hands.
I have noticed that if I schüttele, I accept your energy, it will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby.
It was a big surprise for him, as he met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door bell that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: 'in the film, I see a lot more'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic Daily variety, Todd mccarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "that was very good story, very well include film."
In the film reviews on the Web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has 76 percent received positive evaluations.
Light norway: The Russians have tested a missile
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But the start was not successful and described as a type "Bulava missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slow to the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not even started, or in the air.
In the Russian newspapers about "bulava" than a "missile, which is not flies."
A missile, which is not, but it stands to reason
This 13th attempt came at the beginning of normal.
At the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified Fliegendes object on Norway was actually the damaged "Bulava."
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has diesesmal protest and claims that it is not able to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell affected by the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without error, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence, only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
Almost 50 per cent of the success that the generals met with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" even without problems, and even fly to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed with 51 years with an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov arises again, with 51 years ago, in a professional ice hockey game.

Fetisov, who finished his career with forty years ago, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need a further defensive players.
Fetisov has regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some of the rest of formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only a game.
I believe that this is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, players nemcinov.

Hyundai has been the unions after all the overtime will be lifted.
The management of the Nosovice car factory, Hyundai agreed with the unions on the lifting of all overtime.
Because often overtime, the union announced willingness to strike on monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The board but with the trade unionists still wants to agree on a Saturday class this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a fundamental principle, therefore, on saturday, 19 december, proposed voluntary overtime for the reason that two working groups would be worked, said vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company's staff, which would work Samstags class offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
The staff in the event for the Saturday class on 28 november.
According to the company has decided to change type of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime pay or they can pay for holidays on 28 December and extend the Christmas holidays, vanek.
In addition, all of the staff of the Saturday section the fares and lunch.
With that in mind that the most important and biggest moment in demands and complaints of trade unionists, had the last week, the production has the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of december, vaněk.

Czech discovery: a substance, which ',' 'HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the drawback is that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
Their use will be accompanied by a series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, also has the development sg. resistentviren, against the medicines are more effective.
The work of the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences, CR experts from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological University), Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how we can deal with the virus-resistant.
They have shown that the substances on the protein known as Metalokarborane, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new "enhanced" compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor -, hydrogen and carbon atoms, and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Being in the home and constant virus
Hiv Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus caused by the HIV virus division would not be Infektionsvirenpartikel mature.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, say the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences cr.
In the work in the Science paper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then further changed systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested, including their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect, and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further research, on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ods, Mirek topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ods, described the Prime minister as a "strong worry".
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, officials said that the concept of the cabinet, with the support of the ODS and CSSD, Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in Parliament on the minority when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be to remain in office.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday approved the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party - amendments on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals of the social democracy that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, so it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional frase not clear.
Frustration and futility.
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the premier.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
Reason to do so is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
The fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Nominanten Necas the Social Democrats (CSSD), the enforced changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts deficit will enhance laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the service law should be changed.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not to
That is a matter for the Prime minister, fishermen and the entire government.
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek in a text message from the United states.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decided on the fight against the level of deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of the people can count on Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, said of the citizens of the Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime minister.
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats would explicitly ask that you allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not rolled back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I go to the mandate, I knew that in coming months in particular could see with their own Parliament and destruction of everything would be positives, Topolanek itself.
After the new map of the CD (czech railways) will be fewer trains for roughly the same fare.
The Czech railways or from 13 December some less its Schnell- and local trains, other links will be strengthened.
The whole transport volume from the day of the new road map compared with today at two percent.
Most of the charges. incl grass roots and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several link opportunities in the capital, for example, the inhabitants of the work area, the railway for this type Pendolino trains.
The train will no longer to Bratislava (the).
Less fast trains will also be on the route Prague - Pisek - budweis, in principle, the direct flights from Prague to letohrad.
The biggest reduction in the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove (king graz), about eight per cent, an increase in Prague and environment.
Be lifted two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on some days in the week of the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, at the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance also in the capital will be the main railway station in the target station Prague - ends.
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and ostrava and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik will in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of transport, overall, the railway to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kronor, as well as this year. the Local trains take care of the districts, overall pay them in the next year, eight billion kronor, the state three billion indemnifying.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and fast trains has completed the railway a ten-year contract, until now, the Treaty only for a year.
The railways praises the system, perhaps, she has not resorted to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Among changes, it is only in one-day Netzfahrscheinen CD and in favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska Net.
For passengers without the customer card will be the price of CD net 450 kroner to 600.
The price eLiska will depend on the stecke, until now, he was for travel between any district and cost 160 kroner.

The supporting players in the role of the legendary South African champions in rugby, Francois pienaar, Matt damon.
With the launch of the film will also be reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela.

All three head and say that we take the cherries, we have made the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge to voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken from January, the changes.
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary.
But now voices are the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumokokken.
The Institute of Medicine sets the maximum price of the vaccines, which have to pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination.
Vaccines for children free of charge for August
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they disturb a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose of vaccine should be taken between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses are needed.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities of 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children around 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination programme was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung cause, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen died in hospital after investigation per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty - vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
The vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, said that this vaccine could be in the future.
From January, should be paid for by the insurance companies and voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association nahlas, Rudolf kalovsky.
His association with in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the International Conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccine trial Pneumokokken.
At this moment, we do not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The chairman of the society of practical kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents their infants against Pneumokokken from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this is also the first set vaccination will be paid for by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
After the original plans should the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and doctors receive them on the same path, as well as other vaccines, issued by the state.
Some Members were, however, that the insurance, "the money from the health insurance.".
The doctors the vaccines themselves and will have to wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners must invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
Still, she, and we
Can the Muslim To Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book out of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French no headscarf love" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) read, an elegant and dense argumentierenden study of a dispute, which the country shares and employed about one and a half decades and whose effects are still to play.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in france, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in france, as Bowen islamic "freedom".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall married (or both)?
Should young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals to be taught?
A Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas in the media.
The author of a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik ramadan, a Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, the Bowen respondents, are usually at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia – the now of a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires give and take on both sides.
He calls into question the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state) really pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
He sees more of a "tightening the screws" values "as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The memory of the world.
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental regions on Earth.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate and life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, and fishing interests in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
Au fait with the complex history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich to sea, only with the rifle kolben his Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young, who were caught when they are behind the bodies of their mothers, were killed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the twentieth century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today, Zooanlagen still typically a millionth of a life of wild alttiers. The climate is rare: The Eisbär in Singapore was quite green algae that grow in The hollow hair of his fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and returns to the threat, the hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in norway, America and russia, the Erlegen in Greenland and canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sleigh Inuit powerful assault rifles, to express their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two nations the ice longest remain.
In his new book "after the ice" (the original title "after the ice") offers Alun anderson, a former editor of the science magazine new scientist, "a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop.
Not to say that scientists have all the answers.
Climate scientists are still Ozeanografen can adequately explain the speed of the changes.

The specific charges have not yet been published, although Cuban right a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of "risk" can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the slight protests and critical writings, a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, will be led by the popular reporter Yoani sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and note Books in Cuba legally, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows ordinary citizens, since this year, the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be secondary skin used for the sending of text messages, since a 15 - minütiges phone call would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect, often need the government to speak their names.
Too many websites, access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison, sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press spokesman for the US representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would in any other free society - the levy free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel vivanco, head of the American section of the group Human Rights watch, which recently a harsh report on freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as leader of the country, the ailing older brother fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would probably be politically and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move towards greater willingness to engage in dialogue with each other.
Cover the Pakistani government officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope the case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to identify the Internet after absuchen radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they obscure insurgents, known as saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to pakistan, after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of the men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the birthplace of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the Al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and still trying to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al - Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Gangmasters act as guardians of the organization, not those who let, whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American does recruits from a Qaeda a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US ambitions and its propaganda value but also as a hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to send anyone in these groups, what better way could go to follow the recruitment model, which so many have already followed?, Kohl said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding in Copenhagen Climate Action,"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the Bella conference centre in the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of a number of government buildings in the inner city.
On a day when promoted by the un climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners in english, "through the city, which was there is no Planet b" and one in spanish, the declared "earth says' enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native land of their mother, her realise what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration to pass on the floor and to world leaders to call a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way to more.
The police, the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either hooded or pocket knife with.
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations are banned.

In the interior of the Congress Centre of the people on television screens, in order to all afternoon the demonstration.

He then in Mandarin and said: "because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there.
He said that from the perspective of the individual is on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data showing persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that in the last two years, the fourth-and AchtklaSsler faster progress than cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, including National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and National level.
The average score of the White ViertklaSsler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 on 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture on a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time span, has reduced the difference with 58 points.
Some education advocates of the southern last week expressed their concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I will not for a span of two or three points, and down, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we always see the positive signs, I respect.
What frightens me, is that we are nowhere near the time and energy that we need to stand up for our middle school.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained, a new reading curriculum that Wilson reading system, to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their young counterparts classes comrades.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten until the sixth class games and lebensechte experience highlights, was brought under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP progress, were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit from below the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit examined.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now the school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year in Washington currently 180 days, in order to compete with charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than the prospect of future
The coach of the Gettysburg - College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising from and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facade and the emerald green lawn.
Gracielas parents have little of the High School in El salvador.
Until recently, had also Graciela in silver Spring has been recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Your attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, the cost was a ehrfurchtsvollen visitors, rather than an enthusiastic prospective students.
"Yes, I will be here!" exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said, as the low Professor to student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants do not end the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, the college education is needed in the middle class aufzu rise.
In truth is one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the College - which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their parents are immigrants here, mostly from Mexico or Central america, in the United states, without the High school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, a huge role in the labor force in the country to play, to show the way forward.
Those who study high-achieving children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and a powered to success.
Many of them have parents who give their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advice programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, will be a single measure at any time not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara, a researcher at the University of California at davis, the hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We need to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school through the High school.
The federal program that funded Gracielas College tour, is a useful example.
It is known as Gear up - a play - and more than $300 million per year for local school systems available to college preparation programs to launch the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the High school.
According to the us Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can lead to rebuild its damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that china, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only shares in two of the 10 auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for non-auctioned fields in June.
The few and far between representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has recently opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of us companies give Asian and European the way, said Ruba husari, the editor of Iraq Oil forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said to get more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
Us firms were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, significantly lower labor costs and take more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have been able to conclude contracts with the ministry.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips were with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts, than any other companies with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the road, one of the great in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its Mitbietern and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay each Felds to increase beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top designers apparently killed in Pakistan.
Top Al Qaeda use planners have been killed in an apparent us missile attack along the Pakistani border with afghanistan, this week, on friday, representatives of the us fight against terrorism.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.

They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said an agency representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Locals, who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the point and took everything quickly, which completely destroyed by the "bodies" was left.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism needed evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading military planners of Al qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and pakistan.
He was on plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil.

He received instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and turned them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American officials said that Somali quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and used best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second, but this reduces the risk that he was for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Al Qaeda Somali - or Talibanführer, since September, and was killed in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal areas and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War journal, a nonprofit maintained website, from an average of six operations per month to two.

Eide redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send a further 30,000 us troops to afghanistan.
The un envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the us timetable for military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Involvement in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political changeover in afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family to agreement, only two years to remain in kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of the UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he had time for a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to try to find a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has, in accordance with un representatives with the search for a replacement.
UN officials say that it is the Swedish-Italian-descended Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guehenno, the previously UN-led peace operations, has been taken into account.
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test, after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of galbraith was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly harmed, because it is already a great deal of scepticism in relation to the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the American-led forces in afghanistan.
He also urged that the un leadership of his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The un rules are so complex that I since may, he said, only one person.
This is disastrous, and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he is not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from iraq, the war of its own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama Administration is considering a sanctions package on the military and political elite of Iran seeks, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people tremendously" suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White house, Robert gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences, if its nuclear programme is not to the demands of the un Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and an essential part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations.
Iran, but since that time, the negotiations on the provisional agreement - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided about whether they should commit themselves to the United states.
Iran, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had agreed in early october, simply, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and chinese, brought together in a way, as it in combination with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31st Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue to follow.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian Mission to the United Nations, was it "baseless and unfounded allegations" some Security Council members on Thursday called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before it in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with representatives of the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the us plans to the American troops by the end of august from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. us representatives quoted gates, masood barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "we will your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a unified iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China.
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them, that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby means one more tomb".
These lessons have you learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, the suddenly began to change course and to encourage young couples to have more than one child, her response was immediate and definitive: "In no case."
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second child is no longer desired, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8 month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously Dicklichen, spoiled individual children who are affectionately called "little emperor", has led to a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 per cent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 per cent rise exponentially. This is far above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities, with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 years of age and older nearly 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, identified during the birth rate of one child per couple was located.
Xie lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning Commission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, "to reduce the ratio of the ageing population and to alleviate the shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich -- such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden, is," she said.
A gradual easing of tensions.
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy, arguably the most controversial injunction, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- triple up on her annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese government officials have attributed to this policy is that the critical country demands on natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to Abzutreiben.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, which was an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for people have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers and members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was moderated by the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiao chun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of beijing, said that government recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children, which is a partner einzelkind.
Shanghai in july, the first Chinese city, launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, the families Belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how we can apply for approval.
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, in order to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked of psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials.
Disappointing reaction.
Although officials from a rural town in the outlying areas of shanghai, said that a recovery in requests from couples to see after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts, however, want to change.
In the community Huinan go with a population of 115,000, for example, still only four or five requests per month.
Unrequited Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang yang, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and legally permitted.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance, the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are assessing the one-child policy as the human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh month, is pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples, psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she would like to just one child, because it was also a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year-old, heard a translation company, said bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, is the birth rate is falling, he said, is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life not for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV to offer the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want too many victims.
The plan to reduce emissions
The un conference on climate change - which until now by wild posturing and mutual accusations - has set on Friday with the publication of a document is a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations in the near future, the greatest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could provide has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special un working group, says about the amount of money, should give the rich countries to poor countries, so that they can meet these short- and long-term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and major emerging countries their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increases should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great deal of flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit cutajar, the Only document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, in order to focus on what the leading climate protection representative come across de boer, the un has described as "the big picture.
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period of 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050, about 50 to 95 percent.
The talks on friday, the European Community has awarded a boost by their assurances over the next three years, $3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation.
Friday, but the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with china, as a representative of the Bush administration has less than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement, without major emerging countries stand up and take action, stern, who also lamented that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he yafei, said that the leading us climate negotiator either to "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week that the United states, china, to tackle global warming.
The future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs for the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic dominance, so Ulate, also as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented on early Friday morning, a 24-page draft Treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive on the small island states' political pressure on the whole political process, "partly because they are now United and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved, in order to reach an agreement.
Senior officials, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Prime entstiegen their aircraft and around through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences in order to "during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people on a daily basis in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, where they make fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft treaty will be passed from hand to hand rather than by E Mail - is already a challenge.
The intensity is just: Almost all of the important ministers are now here and on Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h faster train Monday defined the feeling of
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe through the darkness, to announce the departure of a train, a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in his lightning trip from ashfort, kent, to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then be Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first javelin-commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the midlands, the north and Scotland to london.
The neglected province could be living in commuter towns, journey times would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high-speed tracks still the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government will present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, linking London with the West midlands, with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
The free site if the plan is the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
It is also three options for a larger, leading northwards high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y förmige route, in which a single high-speed link in the West midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railway.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The draft would be offering the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could fall by the london, birmingham.
This in turn would mean that would be a terminus in london, at the 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But even though the wheels in motion, the rail network is to be built in sections.
The trains had to switch from the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of birmingham, which has the journey time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured a beacon for the rail revolution.

Late payments: angry prison guards planned actions.
The unions of prison officials on Friday called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the bonuses and overtime, whose pay for budget reasons postponed until January, before the Christmas holidays.

The union 3. the correctional officers ("CGT Pénitentiaire"), called "to a strong mobilisation in various prisons to unite," on which the overtime incurred in October night increments and Sundays and holiday increments in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable" will gebranntmarkt.

They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 three-year membership of the party modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name for three years, a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent, from the absence of the deposit of the Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves.
Continue to give you to bear in mind that this recklessness is poised to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, but in politics as in life would be better to make a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquired a name on it has no legal claims."
Affair Liliane Bettencourt, François - Marie Banier will be sentenced for exploitation of weakness

This decision means that there is indeed a process in this case, the saga of one of the richest families in france, which is the mother and daughter's and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire, l 'hand.
However, the 15 court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährigen Liliane Bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the Public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
The doctors should be appointed on Friday before the 10 March 2010 to submit a report in the Times give you clear whether, and to what is Liliane Bettencourt, can be found in a state of weakness.
I think they will be subjected to these investigations.

Although the court would have to assess the admissibility of Mrs beds Court-Meyers initiated legal action, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.

No one has the right to act on their behalf, "the representative of the Public Prosecutor, Marie Christine Daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt, Meyer has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the company vis à vis consumers from the marketing revolution: it is to join the staff "values" of the best, as it was made at the consumer products from the technicians in the station to impose.
By the customer at the heart of the company's marketing revolution of the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... Although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon, especially the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of f, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; they claimed by the staff employed, the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be to the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has made his wage workers, this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately not.
- first, because I could see that the entire structure in the face of a new situation after many detours, finally, to do... What it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the balance of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a highly simplified notion of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the us American "neuroscience" reactivated and unwittingly far-reaching research institutes and the media.
Therefore, and it suggests that it is possible the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, a aktuellein Le figaro. Fr survey of Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors to identify and measure
Instead of for the smooth functioning of the modern companies need occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of steering a fundamental minutes: for the workers is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it is clearly as a means of part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Currently only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it allows them to achieve their life goals offers.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors can predict the executives of the companies' social performance "control and anticipate and human resource management back to the right place.
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" Obama praise from the right to a
The American rights on Friday welcomed by Barack Obama on the eve of speech in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United states has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last person I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars has inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way of nine days ago to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of obama's.
In some parts of habeich this speech seen as historic, said said in the radio show "the takeaway" was interviewed.
The Member of Parliament by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased with a "President of the left" to the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and not passing on a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American" speech.
In addition, that he himself as "bucks", as he always does, "he said," as an American president, "as he pointed out that the europeans," as in a security bubble, which they do not themselves and for their protection they do not, "gerson.
Among the few, not convinced former un Ambassador John bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos."
On the left of the President of the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to obama, described the speech itself for a speaker, who is known for his talent as "monumental".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that obama "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and at the same time,".

The federation FNTR lambasted a" fraudulent trade ", because the EUR 100 million were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose eaters of the approaching Christmas days, to avoid disgruntling, laments the unostra.
For the Association of Otre threatens the agreement "to small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a lot of digging.

The new Silicon Valley -
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded secret site for defence research.
Today, the town hall with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nano here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (fiz).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, frankfurt, Planungsdezernent Edwin black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
The exchange of scientific studies
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ firms will be allowed to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want Russian science companies jockeying for contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electrons technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika $.
The town hall was in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") received its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research.
Stuttgart, slows down our ability
The dimension of the Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the deeper set of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in chaos ludicrously construction site.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, which in the middle of the city, were at that time as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19 th century, which acted as a modern rail transport, since it took a lot of time, umzuspannen locomotives from behind.
, in short, briefly, - to go further.
And that is why stations: in Frankfurt and munich.
And in stuttgart: a passage at the half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that he and the Bavarian city is almost priceless, the low down.
However, head of stations have also no longer a-and exit problem, since there are modern trains, locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new route of Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local politicians have won.
The train, not least because the risks of the largest infrastructure Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state.
Städtebaulich reasonably justify the project is still reasonably justified.
New city area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the rail, the transport system is harmful S21.
The transit stations and the route expansion are intended for the movement, which one - typically 1980s - attributed to huge growth.
At that time, there were no competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy must go is to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route because of intense climbs, not for freight trains.
Far more serious is that S21 also indirectly affected many other rail projects.
All of six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is, in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and closely in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 kilometre route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the route in slow motion.
So desperately needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintal route is the real bottleneck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.
Government is considering verdict on the airport.
The provincial government has Wiesbadener Landtag left open whether they will go against the judgment of the hessischen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights in review.

The coalition until 4 january, Decide whether it goes against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized the suspension, and on the representatives of the government to abandon a review of the federal administrative court in leipzig.
Torsten spd-fraktionschef schäfer-gümbel called for CDU and FDP, back to her before the election promise made to a ban on night flights. Otherwise, this is a return to a "breach".
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep its word, said Green chief Tareq Al - Wazir, in reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold the floor."
Prime Posch rejected the accusation of mr schäfer, try the country's government, with "rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to come to their night flights.
A precise legal examination of their time.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, the statements of his group's ban on night flights.

Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the Personalie.
As the favourite Peter frey, the head of the ZDF capital studios in berlin.
A confirmation from the station, however, it was not - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, have also played a role, the ZDF-controller Markus SchaChter not further damage, should also do not get through this proposal to the board of directors.

Had organised resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland koch.
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF in ratings, has refused to accept another term of office of the highly-regarded chief journalist.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Finally, even 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional painless.
Nothing came of it.
The person.
Peter Frey on 4 August 1957 was born in kind.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik them.
Afterward, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed on ZDF, first of all, on the "today - journal."

The Greens announced after the dismissal brenders, announced on Wednesday by the journal medium magazine was elected to the journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary in the Management Board, the Rhineland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF-state contract so that staff proposals of Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An excerpt of party leaders from the supervisory bodies of zdf.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - the body immediately after the dismissal strongly criticised.
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence could elect him both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic, the left liberals.

The study design should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master.
By the end of next year all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed.
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal Bureau of the Juso school groups, the design of the education policy should no longer "behind closed doors," the Minister and university chancellors.
After the Bildungsstreiks should now also the students and interested parties "have a say."
Support for the future academics by the president of the university chancellors Conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "we need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting with the ministers on thursday, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The trade union education and science (gew) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim to each graduates with a Bachelor close access to a secondary Masters course.
The other countries need to make sure that the current generation of the bachelor-study students sufficiently master studying tomorrow with the best possible conditions available, so GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to hire more teachers.
A freer access to the master of the Culture Minister said, however, does not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller.
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a poem that includes the Lyrikers Werner söllner, in which this troubling Sprachfetzen the arrival of experience of dissidents, who won the freedom has won, but at the same time both his language area.
The 1951 born in Romanian Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as teachers worked in a children's book publishers before it moves in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is decorated with various prize in 1993, he was the legendary Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen Literaturforums in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches last Tuesday during a meeting in munich, the "german literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files."
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer, his cooperation as im for the Romanian securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner had received in 1989, the German language prize.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, söllner, "anyone who opposes attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel peace Prize honours for Herta Müller and the unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors shaken by a case from romania, the throes and the cowardice of a political system makes based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as we can tell after bisherigem knowledge, not just the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate file internal Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scholar Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the internal Walter.
He had it in sensitive points for him at the time, "markel."
It is a moral need to make this point.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpectedly, surprise is the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service, however.
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate agents, Herta Müller had already written in july at the time, after having their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people concerned, it must be, and in some case, what other name behind the aliases sorin, Voicu and even Walter second-term.
Unlike the country is now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague.
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered.
The Birthler agency, National Council for reappraisal of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, until the publication of the files, but since then has been more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law which governs the management of the files.
That is the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the winner of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the Prize.
They have a psychosis, after all, they have only once interrogated.
The scandal of power, said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly include the case söllner, as so often the case in relation to publicize, inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of The Zuhörenden on Söllners commitment gives hope that The continuation of this chapter of The knowledge rather than will be determined by apportioning blame and shame.
To Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation of another Champions League.
It was as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party, which had distributed a sporting goods manufacturers Goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class.
The man with the striking shaven heads was due to him outside town.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before happiness was the 55 Jährige.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work.
Or, really.
In the words of the first three days earlier pledged Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final, namely" in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be fooled by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the decline."
"Much more important task" on sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the League of everyday life.
And once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots.
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / arranging re-matches 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 march) on 18 December in Nyon scrutineers.
The joy on the winning start of the successor to behave.
Not only with the supposed saviours, the Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, and pleasure.
I am on the players and told them that they should consider their strengths, and have urged them to be brave souls plumber Gross, said the simple recipe for success, which had been under Therapeut Babbel but no effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel Jens lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, that would not have thought possible."
And Sami khedira,, after weeks of violation break thanks to his dynamism straight to the best players on the desk, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors to: "he is a man who and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it a clear.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sports bureau Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, consistent.
As Gross herding players and managers, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely swamped and deal with the Romanian guests.
They have also won in glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 will wake up to bear in mind.
And sport Horst Heldt reminded that a season goal has been achieved, but is still far off.
We are not out of the woods.
Heldt in his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months was not celebrating, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews broadcast directly before the game start of gate Jens Lehmann fresh lived on.
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
The had been accused of the board of weakness and have decided to change coaches to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also to be free day after play had been withdrawn, valued Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt, consequences for the final man.
They are no friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were all the other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team through playing whilst practising and vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann all - and the man with the plastic bag, too.

The eleven centimetres smaller johnson, before the end of the Klitschko era, but again and again the blows of the world's mayor, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson was doing too little for a challenger and just tried to make ends meet.
He provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, with Klitschko has gone on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some commotion.

Kunduz case.
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information on the kunduz-affäre described as a liar.
The spd and Left sought clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on the air attack by the opposition has Kunduz Defence Minister Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg (csu) a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol lorry in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Jürgen Trittin said Greens Group leader on Saturday in the ARD television news show "-" days.
It is called to the landläufig: he lied.
The order to kill, in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (isaf).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg has said Trittin.
On friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just a destruction of the destruction of the abducted vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
Us air strikes were requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, according to report up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, Greens and Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (cdu), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government of Afghanistan policy - and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and mrs Renate künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.

According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank trucks-attack.

Dream worlds.
Some people see in wachem state pictures and hear voices, others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and narcotic drugs and the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is fine.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must in the wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden.
However, those who experienced in the wake up his dream job conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicted, at least as Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
Traumartig modified public awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if cause and effect may distinguish the vision of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of the new-age-propheten Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin theme and the interaction of various parts of the brain.
Complex hallucinations and delusions thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861, a "great similarity of misleading one with dream" for Sigmund Freud was the dream "a climate of fear, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic figure.
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt them.
The force of gravity no longer has power over him, he is hanging in the room.
He senses a kick on.
Behind him produce more vicious with blood red, distorted Fratzen, ZaHnefletschend.
They were hunting him, him with serious inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious it voices from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet it a noose and strapped her in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and the noose around the neck.
Do it.
The noose is replacing.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today, Henning t. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is a maniac low, he takes medicines, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness for three years, he is married.
In the, I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
Around one per cent of the population at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals treated it as the second most common illness after the depression.
In a schizophrenic acute psychosis affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are in a state of emergency, the hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution complex.
This is particularly widespread hearing voices, votes, or Dialogisieren order to comment.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is not important to distinguish between what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is being inundated with impressions.
As the dream also opens the psychosis, the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt clinic for General Psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the scene, everything has focused on its importance.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as in a dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and you can not actively make.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality, is not possible, the related images are cruel reality, it ends.
Once seen in the life of a lifetime to have
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the climate, basically.".
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the alienation of Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Exactly why our brains antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional conditions can lead in every person that he loses in the short term, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain neuronal maturing at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox explained.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, which first over many years.
Environmental factors play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis if the position.
Halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychosis, as they are the transmitter system.
If our brain is overheating.
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money for drugs, in order to get, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich caste.
Whether fantasy as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of the position.
It collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and related phenomena, last year, he has his results in The book "The unreal world in our head" evaluated.
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and skull or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, consists of content, which would normally be withheld.
They are, if areas, in which sensory processing, are actively discouraged or too little; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger this state of affairs, as well as brain damage or a.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love mental distress or other mental conditions.
Recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life of a.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attended high school there.
A normal girl, really.
If it not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
If he says, take a look at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They believe the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. dreams, it knows it.
She is awake, they see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank in addition to see or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for Moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other was wearing images are not real, and then disappear again.
At night, are some of the most frightening phenomena
Often, the are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, it can sometimes do not follow the teaching materials, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new Mitschüler, while for all other hearing and visible from the blackboard mathematical equations explained.
At night, are some of the most frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake dreaming, whether the pictures, which sees them, the Fratzen or the girl arms and legs, with the bleeding before their open or closed.
Let me in, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them to, would be crazy.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations.
Since it has taken on the Internet contact with the psychologists castes, she knows very well that it is not crazy.
Obsession is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus withdrawal, he has in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an individual child, as a little girl, fear of other children, they often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man known as Papa, since they can think of is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and audio hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and sounds, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, and that is why they are so real. "
Also at night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to the schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unlikely to see.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between the dream and hallucinations.
In our world too much bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience is, unfortunately, alas, says Michael Schmidt rapier hard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it is also positive, creative / obsession is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt rapier hardware has researched the so-called oneiroide thrill form, a special form of traumartig modified public awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex and detailed virtual dreams, which holds the Erlebende for real, and he also retrospectively cannot distinguish from wakefulness.
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, Polyradikulitis patients experienced in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and weltverlust is under threat, for example by continuing, complete impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, the reality is, says schmidt-degenhard detached.
A kind of border state between dreams and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, a world of letters, but the real situation in the Imagination.
An intensive form of sense Foundation and meaning in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not in a loss of loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid - experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart operation, followed by a heart transplant for days on travel, while his body in the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit.
Claussen a in a selbstgeschaffene world, other times and places: he saw himself as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, with his hospital bed in Firnschnee of the Alps and hits a Korean mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.
Quite the contrary, i have the memories from mental travel even after years and in secondary details overwhelming.
Even clearer and more intense than memories.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other lives of worldly experience, says the psychiatrist Degenhard Schmidt.
At the end of the show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal given the external reality in the guards.
Any change of consciousness, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be rewarding.
The snow can fall
Burda_OOV
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years of
The new head of publishing Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he told the Mirror.
The holding include in the future to 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children heirs with 27 years and have the firm desire to enter into the company, said the 69 year-old the mirror.
The details, we have regulated as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are active in the company, then.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
You can easily ask staff his children, if they are not enough.
This brings the children, and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is from January by the chair of the board to withdraw, and Paul - Bernhard Kallen appointed to his successor.
The 52 year-old Kallen in Burda is a member of the board since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the treasury, the responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, he is not a family member at the top of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also, "10 to 15 years," burda.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda that family businesses folding certain: "it was always families who have been infected by a capital addiction, which have speculated away completely and thought that they could rise as a major player.
My strategy was never the case.
He had "never makes world of dreams," Burda.
I am not as the political PraZeptor this country, as it Springer was, and I do not want to play in league with 'time' with the entire world, these shops are too great.
The promises the promises of FonPeek
Peek äuβerst is limited, a device with which you can read his e-mails, without any possibility of being able to see certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is to see on the streets is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smart Phones costs costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half the price of a flat rate of an iphone.
After the company's success has seen it has two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, in which we must pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek Le Web was presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, such as his American counterpart, however, as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone around 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone, already know what it means to be away from all the data in order to be able to read his e-mails, as soon as the land border crossing, or if you are desperately seeking a cafe with WIFI (or a link with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with a flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, in order to be able to read the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails, and rightly so.
That a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing is that it has the name of fon, although it has no Wifi / wlan) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly but surely rethink and start various options to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is precisely what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it is, the Peek already in the United states.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system to see.
The impact of the colour of Michelle
Gelb is, without a doubt, the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in oslo.
Michelle Obama has very similar models: on two occasions that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes in the way, from which they are made.
At the inauguration was a dress from head and one from Gemusterten office in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair was different: the hair were put on this occasion as hair wreath, with the previous bore the hair.
75% of working mothers have given their maternity problems in the work of
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for women to study "fertility and career women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity restricted.
The study makes it clear that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who work outside the home, no other work only part-time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the drawing, a figure that has to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, which took longer to achieve this and together and the first child until much later.
It also has the kind of work a major influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of readiness, "explains the csic, Margarita Starkevičiūtė delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of the women in the marriage and the first child to be taken into account.
According to the survey is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child, the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the primary school or a higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
There, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school completion exactly the other way around and find a permanent employment and marry later and have their first child, delgado.

Here are a few words from the book.

For Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a big deal poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife blade, which nearly killed him."
Graham Greene: "Our man this woman with a passion that has lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, in which meat is the emotions on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, United, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the route of corruption."

On Louis Ferdinand céline: This writer, the insane cry on by a bridge from the personality from munich, so that his response until well into the night of the 20 st century hallte on his literary manner. This he made during a trip, which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worms-that posterity.

Cowardly aggression.
My 70 -year-old mother was walking last week by our part of the city in the town of fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years, in addition to her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling, which we have taken from the animal and just six kilos, and then out of the blue lost him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard.
It is not our outrage in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, where since the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and defenseless animals should be, of course, was carried out on the leash.
The attack, a woman who cosy top-ranking, these people as a result of the incident, they wanted to chastise; indeed, they feared for their own lives, because if a Wahnsinniger attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps also with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has spent all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nahgelegenen police service, however, we have grave doubts as to whether it will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, at an animal which we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for traffic safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies announced today.

This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which under the slogan 'to be or not to be' is, in a first phase will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread.
In conclusion, michelin, stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they themselves as manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles always see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of vans is rising again, something
After almost two years since the beginning of the car market for Kleintransporter finally shed some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months will decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution, because the reference data used in November 2008, this was a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the whole of the authorisation of the 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure, all vehicles, from which the small market is, include: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small, small vans and light vans/chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
To these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this landscape, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help.
This plan is intended not only for individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to a small trucks up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 ausstoss, must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded us that it is part of the state, including a special attention to this small trucks and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealers association predicted for the year 2010, a similar year such as last, for which it with a loss of sales (for passenger cars and suvs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty of
At the time, as was the case with the anti-lock braking system) and how it happens now with the ESP stability control systems, the aid must be a duty on the brakes in emergency funding in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles a transition period until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, however, can help these braking systems on the basis of their operation to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers, the system on the basis of the drivers Bremsstärke carried out on the brake pedal.
However, this system this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned inquiry, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the toss, not more, on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 branch accidents.
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and thus also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even less accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent seat-belt reminders popularity.
Then the vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then reacted to help him in the system, the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent exercises maximum pressure on the brakes to minimize the damage as low as possible.
General Motors is postponing the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (zaragoza) by Nick reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (gm) europe, have been informed that the production of the new launch in the first week of april, probably on 8, according to Mr ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wanted to ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which first postpone the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be presented by the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen GM said that it will in the next few days, a decision on the sale of saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government pressure on the American industry has increased, so that a decision as soon as possible.
GM exists, with some of the potential new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports, has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is becoming more and more popular.
If none of these buyers should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close at the end of the year, if it is not sold, will be maintained.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel was used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms.
In order to create something, refrained from first to the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms, thanks to the aluminium used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again in 13; it has also reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that were saved another 7 kilograms; saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again in 12 and with the slight 19 customs wheels back five.
It was also through the renunciation of the audio-CDR system-30 six kilos less and again through the exchange of door handles, handles the lack of substance kilo.
Although he was also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride in a vehicle with a 6 - popular hand wheels carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, which are really very kurvig.
In his way, can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the road.
It is, in fact, the opposite is the case: for long, we no longer have such a small and easy test, which is a model but also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to lawn, too slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we suggest it with our hands on The steering wheel, thanks to its control, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he makes it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes.
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster s) is very good and he cannot increase with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which has already in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration of is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or inconvenient.
The asphalt on the roads, where we are with the Boxster spyder, was damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had on the entire route almost nothing to do; and, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, with a Fahrspass indescribable, as it is rare, and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster ss.
The car in February 2010 will come on the market and costs EUR 70.831.
Bag Girl '.
The singer, a friend of Finland by Karl storage area, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett in the Modenschauen 'maison ', they presented their rude face with the same such stubbornness as their pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It girl", it is a "Bag" girl.
The Baskonia paid themselves a victory in Israel.
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and so in the first place in its group after the great performances of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple was the best of his team in the assessment (29).
The team from vitoria, the significant loss of Mr mann, oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end to its victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten right from the start of the top of the table of ads.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter, it appears to indicate that they had come on the pitch with good reheated hand ligaments.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava opted for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause, which is home to extend their advantage further before the break (34 - 43).
Teletovic began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, including "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of brazilian.
Despite this was the game despite the clear advantage in the recess is far from decided and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of elías" they came into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50 to 49).
Even more disadvantages.
The team of ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to regain the air and one of them was suddenly the gun of Mirza teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that the table again einberuhigender refrain from (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make.
The Alavesen last quarter were exposed and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) has announced that it would allow anyone to them the victory in the first thirty minutes honestly deserved to take away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and eidson, not the best of their team, and their team by three points from the line (70 - 77).
Despite this, and even though mote fouls being sidelined, the team of ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis nor in the last minute (80 - 85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja have been stood up to

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money.
Thanks to their dargebotenen game in the first quarter of the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts with 12 - 18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos, of the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a home match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22 / 20 in their favour, indicate the minute, following a campaign in which it almost to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and so would have both been disqualified.
The Greek team went on to be warm and his superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Free country on the basis of a violation and the three self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clear traces the Unicaja left.
Among their players in the domestic sphere and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with his triple, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 to 32.
A race was impossible.
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite its 19 losses showed superior and even managed to offset the difference in Malaga armed game with 66 - 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn the leadership within the group to waver.
Unicaja tried on many defaults and the departure of the injured during the game the Scots Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the triple by Cook and the use of Lewis hopes for 66 - 57.

Brazil has called for a date to leave Zelaya
The Brazilian government has the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa set a deadline.
The office of President enthobene mandate must be the diplomatic representation on 27 January 2010 at the latest count, though officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegates from the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that he knows that "Mel" before this date the message, in which he found since 21 September asylum must have had to leave.

After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets, which is certainly not surprising, since this is their natural state of affairs, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets it was that the debt with the direct purchase of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly to allow a free hand in interest rates, which are about zero move, so that in this way the banks to buy assets accounted for.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts they achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn increase the differences of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
A degree of uncertainty on the other hand, the defenders of the moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should have adopted a new day thanks to action.
Nevertheless, suggests that what happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren out to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously anticipated.
A government that the public debt, elections and a new government, which on the same hymn sheet.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the external payments and therefore a euro member country, no longer meet its obligations.
It is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of außergewöhnlicchen measures in order to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are, as expected, in an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some lending to large sums of money, and it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain should not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, the European differences and reduce the Spanish dannn would further increase, it is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While here early indicators of a large portion of the market research institute, forcing their scenarios for the recovery and preferable scenario for 2011 upwards to correct, including the OCDE and the European Commission which, again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy all the promises come along, despite warnings of a long life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment, "caution".

The chairman of iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez galán, resigned as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the house, where the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural fenosa, Rafael Villaseca Galán, gave the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola of Spain needs to invest 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion by 2030 from that date, will depend on the fact that the current nuclear power stations to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, however, is of the opinion that we should invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
By 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for the carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he estimated that 18,000 MW more, under the will of course by other "Stützenergien."
Galán, which is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what is called for his company has no desire whatsoever to say something against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which is exactly the opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "measures, such as the chairman of iberdrola.
It says galán, that the decisions on the investment, even if they are, in the long term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.

Acciona competes with high deep and Bouygues at his first construction of motorways in Australia
Acciona is fighting for his first motorway in australia, a market in which they are represented as energy and water companies.
The building, it is a tunnel, the 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros) will cost.
The French company Bouygues and the German high, are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona, in the country as a construction company and motorway operators.
The city government would have completed the construction of the end of 2014.
After that, the administration for a public private partnership (ppp is the English abbreviation) had decided that the project after a business plan drawn up by Ernst & young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and tollgates administration.
In anticipation of in may, offers the estimated investment to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), and in the last phase three consortia, especially from European construction company consisting, compete with each other.
The group with the City will be led by acciona, the only Spanish companies, and its partners are BMD and ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction company australia, while the second, with headquarters in italy, one of the best specialists for construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed from a British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian trans-field, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in a close election, called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), which also includes local Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures promises huge construction and privatisations, however, has a hurdle to overcome, because it is only through the purchase of a local invoice.
A strategy of the companies cited high deep or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed by the Spanish Baugiganten has yet to be pursued.
ACS has acquired in this market only by his participation by 30% higher, owner of the aforementioned Leighton, access.
Million in assets.
