Obama's election of a Republican strategy of resistance
Republican leaders justified their policies to combat spin in the election.
However, in the center of the brennana believe the myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
By the same lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredited system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
This is why most state governments with the 2009 law uslozhnyayushchie, the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the election in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only one 2011 was taken by 180 of the laws that restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyayut right voter registration on the day of the will and take away the right to vote with the citizens, have a criminal record.
Before the election of 2006, no American state does not require voters to present identification documents with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana.
Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
In the last two years, they initiated bills requiring voters to present photo ID in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal ID, as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people who have reached the voting age have no identity card with a photograph, issued by the government of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012, have no such document.
The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photograph.
But that is not all.
Students - voters considered voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use an identity card with a photograph issued by their educational estab-lishment.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to use for voting certificates issued by the club.
Until 2004, no olginskaya required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time a similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting Hispanics.
It is believed that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, uprazdnyayushchie voter registration on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not gone without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the list of about 10 million people.
At the same time measures taken since 2009, led to a fall in 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were afroamerikantsami, although the last was only 13% of the total number of voters of the state.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
With only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike belikh, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, zakonodateli-demokraty and their supporters actively opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills was vetirovano gubernatorami-demokratami.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended with the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules are in effect, of course, zatrudnyat exercise of the right to vote in the election of 2012.
Criticism from Democrats denounce bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The report of the Center brennana from 2011 demonstrates that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredited system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, a test of RVA gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegativnye and sometimes lzhepozitivnye that lead to bespoleznomu medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to begin to doubt that mass, is from even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In research conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among groups of investigational, however received data difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European found different levels of mortality in those patients who were screened, and those who do not pass.
The study also showed, after a 12-year old observation that the likelihood of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who were not screened.
However, I would recommend to pass the test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men also are at higher risk of African-American descent.
The key point is the right decision, once cancer is detected.
Cancer can be as aggressive and vyalotekushchim.
The patient needs to clarify the extent of his cancer risk of the disease, offering him the options, without the mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many of the men, who have detected cancer, will not run the course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and pose no threat to life.
We will offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly we precisely define criteria for deciding who should or should not be a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of test on RVA.
This document (as in English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: HTTP://ca. Com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening Movember.
Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no chudo-retsepta to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all the people were nice and quite moving, 30% Rako cases could have been prevented.
"if no one smoked, this figure would rise at least 50%," said Andr√® bolje, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of Cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to the health of the people.
"even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman Andre bolje.
Promising fact: ten years after the refusal of smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Counterbalancet
According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, pancreas and esophagus, uterus.
"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," add to the association.
Food
The Association also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.
To avoid the sausages.
Shutdown of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"the last may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explained in the association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies is clear.
According to an SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In an assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear.
But Mr Beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and family history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in the details
Last summer, a message that scientists may be able to detect Bozon Higgs, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that this Bozon explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the standard model, our best, or, in any case, "less imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter - but which have never before been found experimentally.
But phisycs are not fully confident that it is precisely about the Bozone Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that she is reminiscent of the Bozon Higgs predicted the standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a single major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed to be sure, although some of the data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that it is a Bozone Higgs, because the chances of mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world of one law is inevitable, said that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, not even try too hard, otherwise navredite himself.
But although particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: the principle of exceptions Pauli, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "kvantovom state" is a "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this phisycs, padaloto particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, which sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli.
On the other hand scurrying around bozony, the gang of anarchists, who have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can prespokojno be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site, by the way, absolutely extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these bozony are, in turn, into two groups: mezony, about which we are here to say we will not, and "particles," through which forces are the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is Bozon Higgs.
These same bozony, it should be noted, not all such exotic creatures, as one would think.
In fact, if you manage to read the Chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal: fotonu bozonu chastitse, or "lightworkers," which is "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with electrical charge is accelerating or changes direction, it "violates" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown in a pond.
From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a fotonom - and, therefore, one of the bozonov "vectors of power."
A more stable field
The same thing happens with bozonom Higgs, with the only difference being that, to this Bozon appeared, should be "violated" another field, the Higgs.
However, the Higgs is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his aunt, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was about the zamerzshem prude, the surface of which could move only very large stone.
This is why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated by CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km away! - to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the relationship between bozonom and mass of the Higgs.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, himself never will be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs: those who interact with masses, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have.
So, what can bring "all of these studies, asks Ms Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test whether the standard model (cm2), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts see.
Besides, some of them passionately wanted to this divergence was found, because the slightest inconsistency may open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oj-oj!).
But as long as the CERN such conflict is not found.
Consequences
The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it isn't.
(see: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research laboratory in Bell could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They envisioned their applications in science, but not much more.
In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory of Bell, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impuljsnymi) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
And besides, there may be a tool for the accompanying the study.
For example, the same uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor light.
This sensor, though this was not at all of its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... "debt"
In the Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should quickly resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill.
Yet in this very important area much remains to be done.
"debt" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the monterezhi.
Prostate cancer, razrushavshij it from the inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house viktor-gadbua bel—ëj in palliative care, which came on the eve of the.
"but this is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he said.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees that he helped to eat.
Bodritsya he even manages to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, do it in the bath.
Courage in a death.
"my greatest desire to cure me from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours after staff found the cure for this malaise.
"in the course of life teaches us that a man must urinate standing," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway-house viktora-gadbua.
Regress to the status of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"it all depends on the person's ability" to come to terms with the rebound, "he said.
Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliativnym care sluchayayutsya important events and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who come in palliative shelter viktor-gadbua, all cancer patients.
The forecasts were taken to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses provides no more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has enabled me to know their children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I want nothing more in life," she says, before you allow to put her mask, oblegchayushchuyu breathing..
She will continue in the coming days, the last visit of his son, come back from Italy.
In the runaway-house viktor-gadbua with the help of volunteers provide body care and assistance in nutrition.
This is palliative care, which is when you cannot do anything more.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11,700 people account for one place in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors.
Whether the comfort of physical, emotional or spiritual.
Dying we agreed to provide rotovye wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks for.
We don't force more diabetics to control blood sugar.
And death is part of life.
Last night we brought beer Mr. H., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son dopitj this beer in feet of the deceased.
"we help the relatives, as well as patients," said Natalie savart, director of patient care.
In the runaway-house viktor-gadbua no one day is not similar to the previous one.
Near the 93-letnim old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovashij everything to survive.
"in the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," said Dr a Christian Martel.
53% of patients taken to the shelter viktor-gadbua, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, you have to care that is available to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the runaway-house.
And some institutions, such as the runaway-house viktor-gadbua and the Society of palliative care at home of Montreal are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care to fear the law, legaliziruyushchego evtanaziyu and assistance in suicide.
Since October, circulates a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfurom mauntom and Dr. Bernard lyapuantom and evidence about their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not enough to secure the right to palliative care quality will be resolved before the transition to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease.
I fear that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists till the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my onkologu that I'd stop treatment, she said she was sorry that I'd stop the fight, "she said.
It I said that my days are numbered!
An all-powerful care not
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanks to the medical staff, for what they have not complied with their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain.
It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the struggle with the pain.
According to the ELSI Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to obezbolivaniyu in 8 percent of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or constantly.
Cannot be more than to pretend that we don't know about these suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want me spent evtanaziyu," meaning "I want me became easier."
The establishment of this report was made possible thanks to a grant from the Research Institute of Health Canada.
Large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for building roads, building contractors, collectors of political parties and specialists on the Italian Mafia day tell what they know about the colossal "system" oputyvayushchej construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
"the industry is very expensive," which cost taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"it's curious how this system breaks down after they were put in the case of all funds, Mr Jacques dyusheno, the deputy police chief and former Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 caused a scandal as a result of the investigation of official misconduct, with dorozhno-stroiteljnymi contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean ball, agreed very reluctantly.
"the report dyusheno" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one ministry of transport would save $1 billion in contracts," if some withheld their instincts to take share.
The commission Charbonneau "has already shifted its two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "open the scheme behind individuals."
Uninterrupting unit to combat corruption, created in 2011
The podklyuchilosj was created in 2011 uninterrupting unit to combat corruption, which includes extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, members of the special unit "hammer," which after 2009, forced to "waste" Montreal, to stop the cartel inflated the value of the contracts.
In recent weeks, there has been a series of seachers, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco Zampino and risharu markottu - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
On the line - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired from his post as mayor of lavalya, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
His neodnokratnom suspected of receiving bribes in awarding government contracts.
In addition, the indictment was charged several engineers to service routes Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The last blew up a bomb, told investigators about the "system" of government contracts.
Within a few years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contract in Montreal, a facilitator, connected with the Mafia, which in turn transferred money Party mayor zheraljda Tremblay "joint Montreal."
In the 2000's Zambito spend money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) various parties of the province, mostly liberals, was then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he was illegally collected funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which zavyshali cost
In Montreal, the "system" corruption was trouble-free.
Gilles syurprenan, a former engineer for civil construction, detailed described her before the panel: in the ten years he received from construction companies in the travel, gifts and invitations to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on matches in hockey and bribes in a total of 736.000 dollars in exchange for a sewer contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that they had received on the leg, zavyshaya account for 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then one organizer from the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, napolnyavshego party cash-box dirty money.
After these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November by immersion Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, zabivshih anxiety.
The mayor of Okrug rivi√®re-de-preri in the east of the island, she counters with the 2010 sale of the minicipal plot, purchased for 5 million dollars and pereprodannogo... for 1.6 million developers at the height of the building boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that the investigation, which will be launched in the end, she pulls the plug, "to understand the system, kishashchuyu Muraviev, to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible."
This process it harakterezuet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will establish its own investigation team and the obsever to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we ubiraemsya at home.
Regularly.
Jacques dyusheno notices for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially his worry about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme," but not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "they told me that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers to limit to 100 dollars of donations to parties, but, he said, it would not change the situation: "until we will strictly limit election spending, in politics will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing parties: "we can't go below; hardily examine the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this story and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr dyusheno calls on those laughs, look in your own yard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season of you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual soznateljnostjyu, but can - and a new dimension of the Paris St Germain.
Profits of great players.
I grew up next to them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I don't raspalyayusj.
From the start in the centre of the prior training in NIF in klerfontene and to my parish in sant-√©tienne I always Chagall forward.
Thus, you will benefit from the competition by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer is not new in deposits to play matches in a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player as I want to be at the level and the place to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my position.
He help such hotarirea as Claude Mak√©l√©l√©, who played in the same position, that I have.
Carlo Ancelotti, the owner of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect across the technical staff.
Today in the first League he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles.
In January I had with him was a obnadezhivayushchaya conversation.
Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.
I trust that he has also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season PSG?
In the first league leader Lyon took our place.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in the 1/8 Finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now all can be.
We will be able to say their word face to face with very good European teams.
First we want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a return match in one in eight finals.
PSG will become the first European club in the short term?
He has to do this already have the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure the position for the long term.
Today it is not.
Financially, the Paris St Germain have the resources to do this project Realschule.
Not to take the title in the first league as last season, will be a failure?
Of course, it would be a great frustration.
This year, we invalidated ardently wish to get the world title.
Last season we were this close.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We are completely ready to do.
On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Trua and we still find criticized for that, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We do not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed with time.
We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has two season fails to pass in the 1/8 Finals, although they have spent a lot of money!
Given the amount we were 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a disdain for our opponents to championship and France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the first league.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is a "zlatanozavisimostj."
It only means that ibragimovich is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first league.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround it.
What he has done, it really is.
It stimulates and others improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you survived the Euro 2012 team from France?
As a disappointment.
I earnestly desired to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a little playing time.
I saw there many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I can play good qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped since my krik≈°tƒÖ in blue.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and should now behave model.
What do you think about the first month of Didier deshama at the head of the blue?
They advance for him.
He has a good position in qualifying for the group for the World Cup.
He is a coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc had reached its goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil.
A good honored draw (1-1) had on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match?
This match has given us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on a tsentrobankah, numbered transactions between receiving the commission fees on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), at the same time is the virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure protocol by the type of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between the members of one level.
About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take bitkojny for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
The bitkojna, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before to return today about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts. Com).
Nothing out of the ordinary in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitkojn as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to advance in a video game, which are made in the course of the game or who will buy (and sometimes exchange).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always controls and processes of any central authority.
Bitkojn in all parts of the network are at the same time, the holders of the company's financial books, auditors, Policy Exchange, pokupatelymi and sellers.
How does this network?
Each deal between two users actually occurs between two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new paymenta user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction, signed by e-mail, using a system with a double-pat encryption key.
The network also can check the authenticity of the deal.
Thanks to the file content may check that bitkojny used in the deal, really exist in public accounting book, razoslannoj across the network.
A key hurdle is check-in/a new transaction in this book.
It runs through the mathematical tasks, razoslannoj computers, to which, like a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
It is a Phase-II file that is hashing conversion of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take "a new transaction and add to her room before the" heshirovatj "all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many hash-value in the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other sites easily check that it properly.
The transaction thus nerarzryvno is associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.
If to cheat the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wish to pay twice the one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unproved, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, the task gets 50 bitkojnov.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitkojnov in circulation, however limited to 21 million, but they delimy to one stomillionnoj that leaves another reserveg.
The complexity of the task also increases with the computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites that provide services Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves.
"the defect does not apply to the protocol," notarizes Pierre nuaza, who recently launched paymium - the company osushchestvlyayushchuyu plƒÉ≈£i real money using a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported about the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the money also enjoy this disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blog-platforma WordPress, their permit.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron vejtsmana from the Institute in Israel, analyzed the book and found that almost 80% of bitkojnov are not in circulation.
"the huge sell-off" were announced in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon holmkvist, who works in the ifarahon coinabul, which is the conversion bitkojnov in gold.
Pierre nuaza, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) beskontaktnogo or paymenta via mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to verify the transactions, which thus is cheaper.
The owner of the better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new hardware or software.
It is enough to tell the address, which can be "photograph and recognize" telephone, says Pierre nuaza, to assure that he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"before the Bitcoin established, it will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to a variety of risks, is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, without relying only on us.
From the US suffered mainly Afghan peasants, which we saw as terrorists.
And we will, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennymi.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commander of the fugitives in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign forces, as it did with the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they sometimes help local insurgents, but more of them will not be as only the West will behave more delicately.
Withdrawal of French troops from the base of the nidzhrab, which I watched from the heights of the nadi≈æa zasazhennyh almond trees due to the French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters have reached Kabul, not being atakovannymi.
With the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not be.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible brawlote from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for bigotry of these peasants in which their surpassed Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and nowadays.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under building immigrants, returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American subpodryada contracts.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not from thieves.
Many young people want to leave as left those who managed the American generosity: a capital outflow.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now has 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities in both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to any mrakobesiyu old parties, nor the corruption of some leaders.
Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment, the Army is.
The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, vedshie anti-Soviet struggle, already taking measures to restore provincial mil√≠cias, which would not be subject to the central government.
Afghanistan, Gornaya country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain extent detsentralizovan, on the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the election, targeted for April 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even before, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not put on the legs, no dam does not function, no irrigatsionnaya system is not repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is made, in addition to fruits and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by decades of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
Rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
It has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to grab.
Without the energy to process iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, no mineral production.
The Chinese already almost left copper deposit ajnak months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig into a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employer province.
It is also to one day by the Afghanistan and Pakistan from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
A new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: liceum for girls, for boys, faculty of the French language in the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and do the impossible task of combining aid from offensive operations, the "voenno-grazhdanskoj activities" at the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC uprazdnennaya) in 2012, together with a small French public organization contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with an intense involvement of local labor, could help to contain the uprising, irrigation, Wells, drinking water, restoring forests, fruit-trees, protection of soils and increase in the arable land.
That we leave for the memory of himself, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget it would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, is often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural work, coming from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the rukovodimyh foreign groups, which want to farmers, as they told me, you need to give them a small nevoennuyu support, which would be good to do would be to them directly.
The difficult birth of Egypt's constitution
This is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all-in.
Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of the state provided the two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on the preliminary text, in which several times were introduced amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic" delirium "continues to violate the word" and "flout the right."
At the camp, his followers are confident that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon plans to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.
It is also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting is like the Egyptian people an ultimatum: "either you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which is supposed to be decided after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the constituent assembly, for the most part of the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals do not respond to the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they shut the door, feeling unable to convey their views.
Representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the bratjyam-musuljmanam.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were progolosovany unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements arose... around the time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that a constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text, which was yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of national attention, Article 2 in the end remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, glasyashchej that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafistskie party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would give the possibility of their more rigorous application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," meet the liberals, who see in this a PR.
Because, in their view, the constitution is islamizatsiya through other articles.
They point particularly to article 220-, which gives the university al-Azkhar advisory role, particularly in regard to verify compliance with sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie pomje, it is alarming, because "people to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can watch the theocracy. "
Many liberals, besides the fact that the next vzbudorazheny, rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"there is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain in the framework of civil rights.
Most lawyers who worked on this text, is not ulemy, and people with university education, some training in the French system "- calm Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around Article 220 may be the ambiguity, as used in it(her terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, "notes Ed.].
And in the future may be wondering how civil judges are competent to make decisions about it. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.
The brothers claim that they have significantly reduced compared with what were under the old regime.
Another controversial issue: the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Council of Defense.
Also will not be banned from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of the Association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they view as devastating to freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now is an insult, which could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles it says more about the protection of women, stresses Heba moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive element is the prohibition of torture in the article 36.
The word, which does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to play last night on television, demonstrations are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

The money in the trip should be taken not in euros, and in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekeli (now 1 USD 3,8 investing even one shekel).

"the great and powerful" to bring Moscow: migrants will save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language backtesting, in the country have already emerged fraudsters selling "sham" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million gastarbeiters.
Most of the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.
On December 1, joined the force of law, according to which each migrant workers will be obliged to take the test on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service industry, housing, Byta and retail trade.
But with time, "promise in the federal migration service - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
The loan will have not only the language, but Russian history, and the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to obtain, and to extend work permits.
An exception is only valid for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the official language.
Not covered by the law, and people can get certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, and the protection of the rights of its being doomed
A network of centers will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, the University of druzhby, Moscow State University, st.-petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was also supported by the State Duma deputies, and the federal migration service.
But human rights activists before the law came into force, a lot of times managed to ask in the press question: what is it, in fact, will give?
That will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians and for the visitors?
First of all, "meet the representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "
Many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service in tadjikistane Viktar —Åe–±e–ªe–≤.
Protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only the organized set for 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems appear the migrants without occupation, education, not knowing the language with no medical examination.
Without an understanding of the language, "said sebelev," the future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who, under the guise of aid vsunut him "tour" in a close Barak, where he and dozens of his kind will be languishing for months without food and documents, vkalyvaya for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"at home they promise one thing and on arrival they deceive, select the passport, not pay the promised salary," confirms the main department of labor migration of Ms tolib Sharipov.
Not cursing, nasyaljnika!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know which is the language of the country, but also on the sobstvennyh-to write from labor.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even a good primary education.
After all, their families have even to feed the children, not to mention to wear them, wear decently equipped and in school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, "they confess.
"you feel humiliated and crippled."
However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights defenders mark an important moment.
The tests will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status is not present, there will be no exam, nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiters still live in Russia illegally.
"welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the newcomers say to get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic preponah and all those same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here's a false registration can be done quickly and all for one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"asked one hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan umed hushkadamov.
"naletaj, not skupisj, buy art.
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that false documents are not only migrantskie of registration..
A few "sham" certificates on the language tests have already seized by the federal migration service.
Fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, nadeyavshihsya thus ease the task of passing the tests, paid for the seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive procedures official testing: it will cost the Labour migrantu in three thousand.
That the main objective for the near future, to protect the system from corruption to "crust" could not simply buy, converged-that and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.
While the government can promise gastarbajteram, not successfully tested the first time, time to explore the basic language course.
In addition, visitors don't know Russian, will be offered work in the fields, not engaging the active communication with people.
The Interior Ministry is not in the turnover of illegal arms market
The share of crimes using legal weapons extremely low
The Interior Ministry's offers to tighten the law in respect of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when without victims, and Gore, a moskovskoye lawyer dmitriem Vinogradova, which resulted in the press killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing travmatiki in public places and to increase the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - with 18 to 21 years.
The idea was the head of the State Duma's committee for security and counter corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian government is trying to address the problem by "tightening the screws."
The network has an open letter, which the authors - representatives of different public rifle organizations - demand to reject the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with a weapon, said the BBC Russian Service yurist-kriminalist Vasily lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the 2012 142 crimes committed with the use of firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while just over the same period recorded 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the area of civil weapons not puts criminals to go on the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow to find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the interior argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Supliers: from factories to officers
"the black market weapons updated on several channels.
The main such channels of five, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who had worked for 10 years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the joint staff.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "an army or military footprint," meaning weapons that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"the weapons was dragged out and Russian officers, and they are," says Baranets.
The kind of "black weapons" - stolen by criminals of the representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes gone from police warehouses, and stolen copies directly to law enforcement officials.
Illegal "suticases" go on sale from military warehouses.
On many military warehouses often explosions.
"there is a proven version of that part of the burnings were made specifically to cover the shortage," says a former military.
Its contribution, according to barantsa, are weapons manufacturers.
"now reproduce private gun-making plants that do not maintain competition in the international market and throw away weapons from floorings on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of "black" market - the smuggling.
Especially a lot comes pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kirgizia.
"there have their production, sometimes primitive, and the mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where are the guns?
Experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of illegal weapons on the black market.
The report on this in 2011, prepared the center of the troubled gosudarstvenno-upravlencheskogo analysis and design.
Experts analyzed the statements by the Interior Ministry and kriminologicheskuyu, literature and open information portals on gun issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "at the hands of officials, whose work is related to weapons," according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of weapons production, 5 percent of the "black archaeology."
American company of one of the gun-making shops, who asked not to be identified, assures that weapons found black kopatelyami, has long been no one buys - too old.
Often, as he says, for the new party of Bogoslovsky travel in a military warehouse.
Through the Ensign man buys unit, for example, TT pistol.
He give her pass through zaborchik.
"he carries it in the city and here to sell 900 euros per share with two shops," he says
"however, the police in the course of all cases, however periodically when Burns plan for raskryvaemosti crimes, conducts secret purchases from merchants of illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"as in the luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I frequented the sites, in blogs, has not yet responded tovarishch, who offered to come to the platform "stick," where will the man who carried me in "oddychovy," where we will bargain.
The price of the barrel, I had only learned there
Military observer Baranets Viktar
I need to get the barrel of an acquaintance who have quit, "says the American company. - I have this friend is in it, but I am not sure.
Sellers in the markets, but there is also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter of a tooth out."
I am now even a couple) to get through a person, which I am sure.
He also them supplies only me, because he knows that I not passed.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
A former military Viktor Baranets tried yourself in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s while preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs, where it was "anything."
"I felt like in a store," recalls makhnovshchina.
The buyer, according to the barantsa, not to offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not simply buy - we're going with the seller in the forest, there set target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am assured that the weapon is hitting well, begin to bargain," describes the procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
The Internet search engines to Web sites and groups in VKontakte, which offer to buy weapons for different purposes. "
This does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"it is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the head of advertising on the Web site of the battle to buy a gun or machine. "
On it users leave their applications and asking questions.
And minors will sell?
"without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (sic).
"buy TT. Chelomeya" - tersely formulates the request "fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service, now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and people who want to buy a weapon row that shovel.
People go, like a hungry fish, and then at the prikormku coal mined in Siberia
Military columnist and former military Viktar Baranets
I had heard about such schemes: usually the site registered outside the actions of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through a cash payment.
"in response, send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," said a spokesman for the non-profit organization "right on weapons" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service, now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and people who want to buy a weapon row that shovel.
"people go, like a hungry fish on the prikormku, and then drill in Siberia coal," he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to the experts, you can meet the amount from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to dymitry kislova from the "right to weapons," Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Mesyats-poltora will have to wait.
He is shipped from the warehouses of long-term storage of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official stastistike agency, compared with January and October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia fell by 7% and accounted for 22.9 thousands, and the number of primit cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.
In the US fast food and supermarket workers go on strike
Through the work of ticket-office at McDonald's is up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days of America wave of protests against low wages in the Department of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" tacos Bell, "" uendis "and" Kentucky there chiken. "
While no one is predicting, whether this will be a wave in the ninth shaft or she is played out in the early stages.
Shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, the organizer of the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations.
While this sector of the economy almost not immersed in the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, in the so-called "black Friday," when on America crumbled orgy of cheap sales, now millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied by potasovkami.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which worldwide employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and piketirovali together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops of the corporation, whose product designed for people on modest and middle incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
However many nizkooplachivaemye employees of Walmart come only in their work.
Availabillity and range of goods to Walmart, one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pays its workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, for example, on the shortage of lift trucks or handheld scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" required to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Average employee Walmart to 9.5 dollars per hour, these costs can not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase srednuyuyu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation in 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on a salary now.
If Walmart entirely perelozhit wage growth on the shoulders of the buyers, every visit to the shop will do them only on 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of the Walmart rather note that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not cause damage or malejshchego Corporation.
"black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second.
A total of its cash machines produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The Corporation's spokesman Dan Fogelman said in an interview with The Huffington Post website that Jobs left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just "another piarovskim gimmick" to its trade union.
"free ticket-office!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object were not department stores Walmart (them in this progresif city are not favour, and therefore they are not), and "makdonaldsy" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that, he even does not give you the hospital and not pay you for an honest job!
Dzhumejn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At this point, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants with the time it increase, but not much, and their average employees receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Less of them in this expensive city earns no one.
How can you be in New York for the money, for me the incomprehensible.
Once through the "makdonaldsy" was almost a quarter of American teenagers, who worked for their shelves after school, living with parents.
Few who saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I have encountered in an interview with employees of "makdonaldsov," who complain that must live on that salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal hangeth coments, the author of which notes that irresponsible to get children, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and povaram fast food system began to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, that is more than double their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that in the fast food were created by the trade-unions organization.
American law prohibits the administration of the trade union movement to prevent and punish activists harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.
But to reach the fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main extraordinary turnover.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place in this day, and a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the shares appeared in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald's near Times Square, which featured several local, in particular, a member of the City Council, dzhumejn Williams, insisted: McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for honest work. "
The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, insisted that "we must all join in support of fast food workers so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every njyu-jorkets!."
What was characterized as the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which tens of thousands of people employed in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark the flames of the mass movement.
"until it is medium" to deceive the brain
Popular among fans of modern technology the augmented reality has recently been seen largely through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at their annual conference of the model showed Google, and then, in November, it became known that the application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the director of the interactive 3D technology in Microsoft sharamom Izadi kembridzhskoj laboratory for scientists should be that the company points - the stage.
It is the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
"tell me, please, in general terms, what does your research group?
"we are human interactions with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While stuck in the mass of humanity on the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanjya in their fingers.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting zhestovoe management.
- what else awaits us ahead?
"despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, much still is on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information has improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is.
We are trying to change that, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including proektivnyh.
You need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
"what do you think about the voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate it?
"it is definitely not a panacea - a question of privacy because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, for the management of the devices in public places we have projects in the framework of which we thought gestures, but not over swinging, and over such short, short.
The gestures were not digicam devices, and naruchnym bracelets, which recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
While he is a big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristop hours.
But in general the future for mixed management, for example, gest+golos.
"it's like?
- for example, how do you ask me to give you this bank for?
You say, and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, you want to get users to adapt under what may or may not be at this time machine?
"it is not necessary, but it is the mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we mostly have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will determine the possible reaction of man.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
"if we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you have claims to modern cameras?
Lack of permission or something?
"in principle, the current generation is what can make a start in our work on trivariate recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 with the speed of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not in the megapikselyah, and as the Matrix and depth.
With the latest point of view of all current technologies are not good enough for us - it adds the work of designers algorithms.
It is necessary to remember not only about the resolution of the x and y axes, but Z.
Flat-125-5 is also very important, the frames per second.
The movement of people is quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen betishes of our redmondskoj laboratory to touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) Index.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be in my work very useful equivalent of such devices, but does not require it to be a frames per second.
- and the number of cameras to increase not necessary?
- in the Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually infrared emitter and the second receiver bounced signal.
And now the third ostava is, in fact, a sensor visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of settlings.
It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, poigratjsya with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in 3-D definion provisions.
"as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their glasses.
You don't think in terms of daily use technology augmented reality glasses - it is one of the most promising platforms?
"of course, walk all the time, holding a smartphone in their hands, not very convenient, but that's what I think: the steep option would be to" augmented reality "on the basis of the cloud platform, when you could switch from points on the smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.
Skill-points is a very personal device, in that their strength (private things only see you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
"imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual golograficheskimi objects in the air is not only Tony starku of" Iron Man, "but an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which often show critics of this idea: not touched by the recall!
The hands don't feel!
What answers your group is preparing for the challenge?
In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is seventh in the breakthrough in the interaction of people and machines.
I think the eighth may well be additive taktiljnyh sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a kind of a substrate for the image.
It's great to you!
But there is technology, which is really aimed at giving this "pictures in the air" osyazaemosti - for example, interference at a certain point of the Rays, with a finger, gives a sense of, but it still very weak, as if poduli are on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction.
"and you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
"this is a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
Here is another task on which will fight for a long time - how to make a person is physically very limited, to believe that he is open, almost infinite - working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not such as the clubs), moving platforms, as well as the huge Sharov.
While the brain is either a fool, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things in a rudimentary level.
Instead of culture - vkusovshchina's Rosbalt.
"Rosbalt" continues the project "st.-petersburg avangarde," dedicated to city dwellers, who are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art.
In this top-spisok bright figures have already entered art-stseny peterburga, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the nationwide fame.
The new hero of "rosbalta" - epatazhnyj artist Kirill Miller.
The entire town knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all krasnoye, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable parties and vernisage.
Pictures of Miller always collect crowds, wherever they are.
Kirill Miller is one of a st.-petersburg sotsialjno-filosofskih skazochnikov, the creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man st.-petersburg avant-guard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, the Man City, their appearance in the streets of the smile for citizens, to the mood.
Recently he took sharmanku in the hands of Petersburg and became sharmanshchikom as ripe for this complex role of all of its bogemnym existence, philosophy and image.
 - Kirill, and why are you still walk around the city in the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
 "I chose red as the designer, who has a view and image.
In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, imidzhmejkerom and society.
Although the society all that a bit not Gray, causes aggression and fomentation of the malign properties.
But my provocations directed to begin the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate.
 "and when you realized that there should be an artist?
 "the exhibition at the theater, where the nevskaya were exposed to my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and the new, volne like me were unclear.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with postgazonevshchinoj, which led to the "pushkinskoj-10," and more waves was not.
I get in the theatre, the clothes, the music of all genres, in addition to words.
 "all of this has been united in your art-klinike..." I was important experience in the center of the culture of peterburga, where should meet all of the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took territory at pushkinskoj-10, and there, there was no repair, there was a muzykaljno-artisticheskij Club, a bohemian Club, home of the st.-petersburg Bohemia.
Many there were born: nomy, tekila-dzhaz, remember, as a string led with the project "the ear of van Gogh."
Cord, and his friends sang under the veneer light song, they were obtyagivayushchem tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was a leading many programs to hali-galivskih times.
We gave them trahtenberga, and went his great career and basic education and upbringing he we have received.
Palatstso "Dmitrii 9,396," griboed club "is the echoes from the art-kliniki.
There our employees and regulars are gone.
I hero of yesterday's century, when the culture of something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "people of our city."
In the category of "Artist of the year" was named I ended my climax.
In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not much cultural.
 "your work is recognizable s√©rieux.
 "many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and sharpness.
I will have the software exhibition, "the Russian Museum in klounah."
Expo-center - the timeless category.
I used to be so social was now is painful and scary.
But in the klounah all razmazyvaetsya, the tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have groteskovye ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by dressing in the form of totalitarianism.
Now, according to odezhke vstrechayut, based on the mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand to be with Roger and layer-by-layer.
And deception will be removed with the help of dressing.
 "recently, we saw you in the role of the urban sharmanshchika. - The Cultural City should have such a hero.
It is me, they will.
 "well may and commercial art can be beautiful?
 "now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet.
Is the disintegration of cultures.
Before people crowded together in the pack, and one loved, easy wap.ludiwap.com.
Now all crashed on the mikrosoobshchestva, it is difficult to love everyone.
I'm not stodollarovyj to the paper continued.
Now we need to think who would like.
Now every cult hero for 100 fans.
 - and on the Stas Mikhailova comes at a few thousand!
 "it comes on, there is the broshenki sekso-sotsialjnaya.
And on cultural grounds of 300 people will come and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end, less management, money, all languish.
I have fans, the important thing is they don't fool, not spoil won.
I wrote the pictures in his youth, that they have one collector on the wall next to the faljkom and Larionov hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse.
They say: the culture of the spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I for this culture.
 - Cyril st.-petersburg lacks?
 "good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: official from the culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
Under the right of all is not as it was, the Kings, may not really understand the culture, but they felt the need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have in st.petersburg people have, which could be experts, but they are pushed as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and will give them the road.
Now the vkusovshchinka flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who must seek to other museums.
 "what's for you is st.-petersburg?
 "st.-petersburg is not a cultural capital of culture, in Moscow, there is far more of the soil.
And on our stones of art to grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe are a lot of people who go to curious exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the grant of st.-petersburg.
Born in space
The Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with the asteroidom-ubijtsej.
Caravans of space ships with zemlyanami on board go in search of extra planet.
To save humanity, there is the question of how to continue their race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets, which can be managed at least hypothetically.
"it's Venus and Mars," said a senior fellow at the National Institute for Astronomy name P. K. Sternberg (Gaish) Vladimir Surdin.
But if Mars conditions more suitable for life, then the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on the plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then create in the orbit of the tiny insects, muh-drozofil sporophores.
In 1979, the space was sent to check perepelok eggs, as a developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get on an absolutely normal young bird.
But away from the problem.
"the problem with the fact that this nestling should find support, he should get back on its feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around.
And after 10 hours of newborn was full of atrophy instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that through the four days they just died.
"and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible there with them to work," said the failure of the experiment with the ptentsami in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last time with animals biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, on the biosputnike "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
It was an experiment with mice that were sent into space, already with a fetus.
In principle, there weren't opgedeeld.
"it's just been on the biosputnikah, but again, this is a unique experiment, and such research you need to do," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But approach the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out.
Not an easy task.
The animals, losing the habitat, simply may not realize their sexual instinct.
The man, in contrast to the zveryushka, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create with emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not.
But women in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Valentina Tereshkova.
And the most precious of humanity, that there is a female body.
Our Chayka is, and no one on earth could not say whether he after flying in space.
Whether it will be able to give birth to the child after this flight.
"because this question no one answered," said the veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the first zhenshchina-kosmonavt flight in space, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan nickolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman Svetlana Savitskaya, twice visited in orbit and even porabotavshej in an open space, the son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have little unit, there are astronauts after long flights, which have all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"and if more, it is dangerous even in the orbital flights," concludes the cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, the humanity to look for any new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.
He is a gidrolaboratoriya step in preparation for the flight.
Here in conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work on skills in an open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, let the water and warm, but still, the alien environment for infants - native element.
The small ihtiandry if confirmed - life on the land out of the ocean.
There is a correlation between what malysh is about 9 months of mom in okoplodnoj fluid, it would help him get used then to vodichke.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks.
"it's a little something to forget," says the instructor grudnichkovogo Sailing Marina axenova.
In short, if children are born to a more natural state, the weightlessness for women - is gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in the weightless dryahleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, drops the ability to expel the fetus.
Well, skip it, relying on stimulants of labor activity.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, will push it.
"then what?" - sets that include voprosy Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, children also need artificial gravity.
With no sense of Earth's gravity, the body does not form a skeletal and muscular system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special exercise suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be vital.
"and this experiment, which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to the point that we bring to land a disabled person, completely dezadaptirovannogo," the head of the Committee for the Bio-and IMBP Igor Pestov of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Until the birth of children in space - the question of the theory.
However, after the time it will be a reality, when earthmen on their ships will travel to far-off planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.
The head of the main kontroljno-revizionnogo management: schwarz-sistemy failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement of the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme kontroljno-revizionnogo management, from an interview for the website aktu√°lnƒõ .cz.
"the law will never be perfect, but it must be right that, in my opinion, we do not have," commented on the current situation of Kala.
A similar conclusion provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices are nechasa st.peter approach to the so-called schwarz-sisteme.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb the entrepreneurs -came is banned or permitted?
"the law should be in any way, and if it something bans, the prime minister could not resist the institutions, which are required to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations," states the feces.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in the framework of which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly is it?
A parallel check, meaning that we started, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, the question is that European law says, how should be public procurement, the next national legislation and then also the use of the practice.
The information was collected and, even with the still unfinished verifcation, revealed the interesting differences - in short, the legislation we have can be "precise and error-free," but in practice we in certain parameters to Germany.
It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more revised rules, should focus on the application of the law.
But actually as this project can help you that he does it mean for you?
This joint control can contribute in efforts to stop laws, reduce and refine perfectionof restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting appropriate things for reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we achieve this, by lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system perepolnitsya "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if exercitiul not down.
You talk about the internal problems of the practical application of the law on public procurement.
But as a system of control in Germany?
There is there such an organization as our chickens (kontroljno-revizionnoe admonistration) or it works differently?
As for the institutions, then there as our chickens is Bundesrechnungshof, arranged for our principles, but there is also the board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of the audit and on the level of federal lands - in their system is slightly different from our own.
BRH can only control the federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal audit chamber.
As for the local legislation, there is easier than we have?
In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can't definitely say that it is better in all.
This is so because they are better at dealing with the control?
Definitely not, but once again, such comparisons do not like me.
But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
Speaking about domestic legislation, then as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it still does not appear in our work to control.
As we spend control after the fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.
Take it into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have to use our new tool neekonomnosti risk detection, through which we are not up to almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed. There, of course, these changes will come, because changing restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is.
The problem that can occur is that the rules of the "uzhestochatsya" and cannot be observed.
Under the previous rules of controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way?
I think that is not the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not trade-distorting for a solution.
Such a system will only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb the entrepreneurs of the so-called schwarz-sistemy. What does it mean?
"schwarz-sistema" is banned or permitted?
The law should be in any way, and if it something bans, the prime minister can not resist the authorities, which are expected to check and seek the fulfillment of obligations.
You can say, "we change the law and allow it," but this is not to say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains very stringent rules, like what must formally be conducted, and it is the right thing. This protects the public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of technical problems.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be right that, in my opinion, we do not have.
The road sometimes slippery, but mostly prohodimy.
In some places, the Czech Republic road frozen and snow-covered.
They mostly prohodimy, but in some places with greater caution.
The Karlovy Vary region
Today in the morning in Karlovy Vary Krae roads were prohodimy, but in some places frozen and snow-covered.

Shimon ornest: at the concerts we want to accumulate a positive energy
What do you think about that in less than a month should be the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily popadaemsya.
Together with a group of the tap tap we always joke on the subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to raise enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you tell more about this readers?
It is a national fundraising event, which we plan to obeschala.vot for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has about the end of the Mayan calendar, which announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before the event, the 20th of December at 9pm in parallel run three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They are gone, roughly speaking, in that moment, when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone for 12 hours before we end mayskiy calendar.
Who came up with the idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all come together with our artist gonzoj augustoj.
In addition to the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think about the together with the public, the condition of the world we once to our children.
On the occasion of the calendar may we have created a unique collection of items from topanok, gurky, sumok and oem-based klyuchikov against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www. E-tap .cz and thus at the same time to support us.
A group of the tap tap, together with other musicians also sang the national anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
It will be if there is already some listeners YouTube anthem in these benefisnyh concerts?
Of course, in the end, if it will all work out in the end, and the end of the world does not come.
His singing all performers of all the concerts at the same time.
Hymns at the same time ring also live on Czech television.
The words to that song wrote and played the role of Jesus in video of Tomas Ganak, participates in the performance of the xindl X...
As you began to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other people of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Tried actively use them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, it is interesting.
The proceeds from the concert will go against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the bezbarjernogo studeo education center for the sixth year, so we are working with the civil association of tap at the Institute of edlichki.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Institute of edlichki and spend with them funny and interesting activities.
The students have no money to go to the teachers, and we tried so give them the opportunity.
The project construction of an additional edlichki in the future will be a separate building, in which we move with this project.
At each concert will play several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make the program, which will attract all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, support lesbiens Chinaski will perform with Dan illustratosphere, Bart, the Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jiri Such√Ω.
About all of the details can be found on the website www. Kpks .cz.
Do you plan any such "grandiose events" in the future?
In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, will prepare a programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, as if we are in the US, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logisticses?
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric wheelchairs, their stroller must travel in the cargo hold of, in addition, a large number of cargo and cists with tools.
Nevertheless, while coping with the Czech ƒçsa airlines without problems. British Airways and British Airways have always been great for us prepared that surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went off without problems.
Thanks to the vyezdam abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on.
With than you were at the moment?
After Madrid, London, Luxembourg and other countries where everything works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared with the Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise independent przesuwanie person on the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There is also shyrokovzhyvanym such banal things, how to keep out of the way people in the elevator.
Fortunately, there already are public organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And that, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, runlevel which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the modification and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe form of disability independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are with the tap tap a bit ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbarjernostj is one thing, but at the moment, when we had the famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things really begin to change.
As long as this single cases - people with a strong will.
A group of the tap tap is currently very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998 forced it to you?
I entered the Institute edlichki as the teacher, around me was a lot of young people who want something to do.
And since I was a musician and play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.
Well, over time, says our lead Ladya angeloviƒç, it's a bit spun out of control (laughs).
The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I have confused?
It is true, we will help that we have started to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, as a matter of fact as if there is no.
Thanks to the European Union can we afford skilled teachers, equipment and so on.
It was a goal so well before you turn the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, podrazhayushchej one another.
This is logical, everything new is made with care, and lasts that long.
There are very few things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression of the man who we see, of course, pity, it is natural.
But this pity is izlishnya, because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all unused personalities, which we should pity.
They are the people who can live a full life and maturate, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if something happens in people with disabilities, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole society.
Whether the success ensured that you strict head of what you believe many?
If we want to do the job properly, we must be in a lot of things hardcore outfit and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe that this is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic floorshow and fly in the clouds, and when they hear that twice a week they should walk in rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But as happens in any group that wants to work and something to achieve.
Currently, the group of the tap tap twenty people.
As it did in the early in 1998?
Only one Ladya angeloviƒç.
We open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open.
He will be held the day before the end of the world, expected on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held at Incheba stadium in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in the club - fl√©da plynojem - in the centre with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert of all three cities are joined telemostom at the time of the song of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The objective of the project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kronor for the purchase of equipment for a bezbarjernogo studeo Education Center at edlichki in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children up to 12 years of free admission tickets can be bought in advance at bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European Space Agency as the second country from countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects the agency.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding.
Recall, for example, about a shternfeljda, who lectures on 6 December 1933 was in Warsaw astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "introduction to Cosmonautics."
The idea of a young engineer (1905 R.) left the audience unfazed, after several years of —à—Ç–µr–Ω—Ñ–µ–ª—å–¥ recalled that only Dr. Jan gadomskij was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France shternfeljd won the prize of Robert hesnault-peljtri and Andre Luis hirsha for the "introduction to Cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan gadomskij (1899, 1966), mentioned above, later became the great propagandist of astronomy and space science.
He published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines.
Gadomskij became known to the world's propagandist spaceflight., and his contribution was praised by including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway drezina, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear even to disperse or to pull carts will be used Raketa.
Information about this drezine known only from newspapers of the era.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile missiles.
The study was provided by Section quipment weapons in collaboration with Professor mechislavom voljfke and Gustav mokzhitskim.
Of the remaining materials, you can see that studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the advent of the German army work was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized printing of the idea of the photovoltaic rakety-istrebitelya, which offered 28.10.1990 rogozinskij, and the next year was the work of the "airline(s raketa-torpeda" author lelivy-kzhivoblotskogo raketa-bomba and aviation.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects of military use rocket technology was a scientific advisory committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the start of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society astronautics (Polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine "problems," in which published four long articles on astronavtike.
In one of them, a professor of mthere subotovich offered to organize a society that will deal with the kosmonavtikoj.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society astronautics (POA) sought to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn POA became its full member.
And in the next year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimierz zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the Federation of International Astronautics.
In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
From 1956 POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful meteorological rocket RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vypolnivshej scientific research.
The first type rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Missile capable of overcoming the distance 1800 meters in length, was about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built the improved version of the rm-1a, and in the summer of 1959 bledovskom to survive was carried out on the two-stage missile rm-2.
That rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11,5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do this scientific work - Raketa rm-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The heir of the first missiles of the type of RM Stala Raketa meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
Raketa was conceived as we use two level, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32,5 kg.
We have developed three types (identified as meteor-1a, -1v and -1s), which is the size of a camera for scientific equipment.
Raketa meteor-1a is the space of 0,4 L meteor-1v, l.lipinska, and meteor-1s - 0.34 - 0,62l.
The maximum range of flight at all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 in the Aviation Institute to develop meteor-2 missiles, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Raketa meteor-2 with the initial weight of 380 kg was able to useful cargo weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of meteor-2n and Meteor-3.
Should also mention the accession of Poland in kospar (the Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a national kospar committee two years later.
In addition, the programme Interkosmos, Poland took part in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial sattelites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav hermaszewski became the second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remeka.
Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision has provoked a lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
Liberaljno-orientirovannye economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that separate economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.
It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with rampant financial speculation.
As a result of significant differences in labor costs (salaries) is the price.
Under this stratifier need to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stem the economic competition in the "misleading" the cost of competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase its own income.
On a mass scale it means for most entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in the countries where the cost of labor, compared with other high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for producing them unemployment, then grow the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation is the reluctance of employers to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that need no specific statistics.
Bestseremonnye methods of private capital to the level of the economies of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially lower the social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the change of the current legislation.
The goal is to get its people to obey the dictates of economically private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool of cuts in workers' rights in the field of labor legislation.
As a result of increased levels of poverty, and with it the difference between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
In the competitiveness of the German economy constantly occur when placed by people receiving such salary that the state they must pay, so they got a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern states of the EU, undoubtedly, lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of the crash or social status, forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or live in the beggarly salary on the margins of society in the hope that someday, in the country's private investment capital.
However, asked where he will undertake?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in its management of the economy.
Next, you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
A categorical answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result, we have the hopeless situation, proyavlyayushchuyusya in corruption, mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministers due to lack of financial resources to the development of private law firms that are related to the industry.
Then the bill says the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, according to the Constitution of the Western type, and from finansovo-moshchnyh groups, which prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberaljno-orientirovannaya democracy now quickly turns in such a situation, as it is described in the works of the appianom "crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies are involved in the violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went into the election with zaranee sold voice... "" decent people not at all of them ran for the post of the governor, and, in the end, once the state for eight months to go without konsula".... "seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose a vigorous man.." Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy on an autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.
Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in the public purposes.
The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character.
It means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour.
Especially tragic is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The decision is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken a monopoly position of private capital in the society in favor of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"from the violence does not work, and never could get" - Sting, the "fragile," with the verse refrena are the words: "don't forget what we are fragile."
"if my sons do not want war, they would not be dying - gutelj shnaper amshela Meera, wife of Rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, caused many responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his stance that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, as an act of genocide committed on Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings, criminal, and who the victim, in the end, today's Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, look at the who first serve is already 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning by historical facts, some of them withdrawn on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of the struggle for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to advance set goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the international wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power out of them could not happen in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the Octopus (I do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
A lot of them not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop rumors linking them with the criminal actions in high places, in the shade of which they were, and that always led to strengthen their power priumnozheniyu wealth or at the same time and to the other.
They are large shareholdings in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare the war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was just 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country's central bank in your hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of central bank rotshiljdovskim for Bank of America, during the civil war, he started to understand their (government) money - and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their hunger for a world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 year led to the development of the plan three world wars, a great Mason 33rd level Albert pajkom.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for this project) and the seizure of absolute power.
Method by which has a team of the wealthy families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of the chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by the murder of Habsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, by Bolshevist revolyutsiiyu.
The first world war ended with a sudden, untenable in the military and economic relations, the German surrender (there was no longer a need of war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European powers, Austro-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation imposed on Germany huge war reparations, than a precondition to the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the strong enough oblichayushchego perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create the multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of the fifth column in sparking the fire of war.
In the late 19th century Rothschilds saw one branch of the Zionist movement, which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The declaration of the Balfour declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to be the first clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
Breaking out of the second world war, it is difficult to estimate, released whether Hitler from chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or that everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was caused by the military reparatsiyami on the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create a war of the third.
If the international bankers will unleash its Jewish people, as in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but on the international level (to take only the sharp divide people by supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to a world power?
Here you need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers palm off people for voting in the election of exclusively their own candidates.
Israel's current Prime Minister Netanyahu's Hawk is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and, given Iran's control over the ormuzskim Strait, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (Bodensee corridor is only 2 miles wide), is also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what is now the words spoken by the David rokfellerom in 1994: "what we need is a crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
A new world order in their view is the world masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy, naslazhdayushchejsya comfort.
A world where everyone is the body at birth implantiruyut chip with which he is being under total control.
"and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on his right hand or forehead on the stigma, so that people who are not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
That's the wisdom: every person who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.
The film "operation" Argo ": when nowhere worse by Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist studentov-demonstrantov seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which were the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration a positive outcome to the situation - she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard because it is at the root of it could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the teokraticheskogo regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of Algeria.
Their fate was at home, the wave of solidarity and antiiranskih sentiment.
Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of the 80s year ended election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, srezhessirovannyj actor Ben afflekom "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history that brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of six workers managed to escape.
After the complex peripetias they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, it helped an extravagant lehenda cover, according to which they went on a Canadian passport as members of the crew, podyskivavshie in the country for the filming of a sciencefiction epopee.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" of Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To be accurate, the legend in specialized magazines wrote about the project, a press conference, the fictional film production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Film affleka is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, real political thriller, the so-called "filjm-kinoopus," the story of a successful libel action, the scam - example could be a number of films about friends oushena.
In the film constantly change the mood - on the one hand, documentarily conceived scenes from Tehran (a subtitle shows significant historic photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film - big differences in this not).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, intercross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - the men in suits discuss the situation for talks on the staircases of institutions on the phone...
Bin affleku admirationful managed to make restart career.
From the vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, Goodbye "(2007) and the trillera" City "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first affleka film, which remains in the hometown of the director - Boston.
A sense of atmosphere places at the same time refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films by the director of the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck it manifests in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - the opening scene of the fall of the Embassy of impressive clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and nepredvidennosti, which arise when gde-to suddenly changing history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake) headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar.
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not suggest a variety of exciting scenes of cinematographic values.
He's been working with this little, sometimes, something dodumyvaet - there it is not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the chase on the runway look pretty nadumanno).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved a larger space, and they are not alone in the film.
Film affleka lacks a bit of dramatism, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest in assessing the performance and retro-stil recreating thrillers of the Seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how the exaggerated notions about Almighty omniscient and security services.
Inflate the balloons, bananas and circus
The WWW. Bankovnipoplatky. Com, annually surveys about the most absurd bank fees, now decided to declare the competition for "the most absurd decision or the project from the workshop of the EU."
"we made to this last event, in which the EU plans to accept sets a 40 per cent quota for women in the major European companies," said the "right" the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the already put forward for nomination absurdnostej - the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women had privileges on life insurance for insurance companies, because they really are less prone to risk.
"further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can advance to the competition before the end of the year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
EU orders to the disputed case, for example, and obyazatel'noe adding biokomponentov in fuel that, as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or directive about the size of cages for hens, whereupon this year significantly tightened the eggs.
Also criticized was the ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoe oil" or withdrawing from the sale of the classic light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 2,8/14 centimeters.
A pan-European device often makes the decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of wet defends requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are, for example, the highest quality bananas in the EU were to reach the length in 14 cm and did not dare to exercise "anomaljnuyu curvature."
The European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing scattered national rules that made it much more difficult trade.
The EU, despite the opposition of some states, all same reduced standards on fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to rastocheniyu products.
A candidate to win in the survey may become last year's decision, according to which the EU sold balloons should be a warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU turned to the American research, according to which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of childhood death by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children up to the age of 14, which is prohibited to blow in the trade fair dudelki.
Funny ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and rules of the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, cannot, given the delicacy of the issues for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead talk of "byurm" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal bankovn√≠poplatky. Com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), proposed for a vote, in addition to several mentioned absurd rules, for example, EU rules about the amount of food supplies in the membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the amounts of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire also interested and the idea of some countries to pay for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the application for a subsidy.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"we are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation, "said in the fall of 2004, then minister of agriculture Yaraslau Palace (CSSD).
As the argument he pointed out that the country was high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called interventional Inkoop state was full of warehouses stocks that had to be taken.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from EU ports, according to the palasu, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, staged a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered the Ministry for regional development minister Paul rukovodimoe, German (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are an exception
Although the resolution in the member states easily become the object of criticism of EU efforts at regulation, as well as the more effective operation and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is a cherpanie EU subsidies for projects that are not even hint at something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states have been discussing the budget.
Powoduje emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have kept the name of "olomoutskie cheeses," but "tuzemskij rum," tradition in our country which date back to the 19th century, our producers should be renamed "tuzemak."
Rum can only be called products from another Reed distillyata, not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products, along with the famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola martsipanom," from the German Luebeck or parmskoj Ham, have proved to be, for example, Karlovy Vary breadcrumbs, pogorzhelitskij and trshebonjskij carp and zhatetskij hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud of pardubitskij gingerbreads gorzhitskie and a tubule.
People want to I safe-guarded Republic, but I like, "said Okamura.
Mr. Senator, as a man comes to mind running for president?
I don't think about how to become the senator or president.
If we have in the country all functioned without problems, I would not go for.
But I just can't watch over the past 20 years the country as thieves steal scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then try to find a solution, as it is to change.
And since I was 40 years old and I independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.
In the Senate, you hit, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Not so if you turn back to the people that you have chosen?
I always said that vklyuchusj in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, would run for president.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
However I need the greatest influence and authority.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation ropshchem sebja in a bar or watching television, but ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
The mass media, which are added to this ochernyayut man, and that confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri paroubeka.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the thesis about material and criminal liability of the politicians and the return of property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To do it, we need to change the law.
You have as a president such authority is not present, and only a Senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied the tours to become free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is politikanstvo - when someone comes in with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately obstructing, and it curbs citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya on order, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
You're a person, more relevant to the right or to the left?
With the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left.
For me, not at all important - a bit to the left or a bit to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not that someone refers to the right and the left, someone I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society, suggested the decision whether it's hrcm or GDP, and I just was against bad ideas.
You angry when someone says you populist.
But not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have any ideal goals and views.
And for this you are trying to approach.
You can call it populism, but all proposals on which I say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament are just slogans.
And with that in politics, you don't hold on for a long time.
Or do you think that when you get to people and talk with them, you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them to his side, so that we have achieved it.
If I was elected president, would not take the trouble to organize a direct TV broadcasting, in which I shall refer to the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.
In case of failure and they will have to tell why this does not want.
If there is a strong person, which will outline the abuse, it will put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
Say directly that I like, not a genius and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I just a beginner in politics, and for its program to obtain the support of the majority.
Things I try to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, through six years of close and return to the private sector.
This is, in part, it sounds as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that one, I did not do, however I bypassed a number of well-known people with an offer run for the Senate.
I went to radimu yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
Also, I at least supported a leading investigative journalist Ian lorentsovu, which opened fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because people really are, but now I feel in the balance.
Sixty percent of people not gone in elections, and most of those who went selected representatives of the establishment.
Only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of his own party?
I have not thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential supporters, and I have no money.
No money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twentythousand of CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about the property declarations, and what is your own business with this?
Personal property estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague at a cost of about 25 million apartment at 10 million, another apartment on the 8 million art collection, about 10 million to 3.5 million, and Aston-Martin, who has a million, and even a few million in the account.
Aston-Martin by the way I had, because it was my maljchishechjya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was courtly with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive on the aston-martinet, own property on the 60 million and you have no money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but their own money is not to invest in it.
It is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million on the campaign.
I should get into debt?
I had put into the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from his pocket.
Spending on campaign I in fact will cover senatorskaya salary.
But on the money I wouldn't have lived, for example, could not pay the son for the English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, so you wouldn't ran.
It means, then you will be engaged in business to live?
Don't you said that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partly reduced its activities.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy.
People would like what I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
But, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting every month?
From two to four hundred thousand that to continue.
And if I became president, then his entgerprise would be finished.
The full interview you will find in the Saturday issue of "right."
The architects of the MVRDV argue that real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example spejkenisse and his recently constructed book mountains - 2 photos
"to me this building seems to be fun, it looks futuristichno, finally we have again you can see something interesting," said Lizette verhajg prohozhaya, on the edge of the road.
And Stephane Spermon, a specialist in it is around a large company, thinks so: "no, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need today another library?
All have the Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now nobody voluntarily does not walk in such old-fashioned library, right?
Spejkenisse maloprimechateljnomu, spaljnomu rotterdamom, belongs to the camp under an unusual record.
It has a population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this unfortunate fact several years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro notes, in the form of richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city they have realized that the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library!
Vini Maas of an architectural office of the Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the bold stolbchatyh diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual calm and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
And while the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, desperate Maas pulls from his original gift piramidku in size and completed it in defense of his project with the following words: "dear citizens!"
Here is my proposal: "Orgil spejkenisse" in the book, the so-called bukenberg!
Nine years later, this phnum worth 30 million euros grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, mail, and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "book phnum" was awarded the second prize of "best library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project involved in the national Dutch competition wooden buildings of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but postmodern pedestrian zones and surprisingly homely town hall, white facades which suggest about the molokozavode, became richer on one piece of modern architecture.
But mainly- in the first spejkenisse in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to the book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
Here only one elevator, taking place in the centre of mountain-mass, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps accurately create a sense of public town square.
The urban environment is re-established.
Vzglad consiously is looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We set the classical configuration of space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space of the book Mountains used skillfully: in the center of the House offices, internet-biblioteka, chess club, ecological center and technical areas.
Particularly pleasing black bookcases, which serve as the building walls, the parapetami, the lestnichnymi railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and civil engineers are lost in wonder, what is the unknown material.
"we were eager to work with secondary materials," explains Jop trauborst, head of the project, representing the community of spejkenisse, in line with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots used artificial fiber material millimetric thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles is one or two of the season, then it can be to throw away.
For the library this painting - for the first time in such volumes - was spressovano in the thick four centimeters.
Under the influence of the heat and the pressure of the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material by the smell, a bit like a new car and a little krossovki.
At the top of the lead 105 steps.
Whoever wins over the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch kroketami clothed and fikus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity to the literary grief.
Costs of the new soul
"it is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment," says trouborst.
It is used for heating and cooling of the Earth's heat.
Although the book phnum standing under the przeszklonym cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly.
Wide-spanning farms of kleenoj Wood, located across glass case, provide shade and take up a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection provides fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above skeptic of it, has visited the new library.
Lizette verhajg also was already here.
As well as acting coach who both traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which bukenberg called "soul spejkenisse, which has long lacked."
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own meeting.
These books were to take the blank space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed library - at the time it was 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves to make up.
"there is nothing worse than the polupustaya library," said architector Vini Maas.
"I think that our invitation now everyone in some way associated with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the task on the professional jargon is called a icavityities.
Spejkenisse wrote his literary history.
And even if they are young and uneducated.
It is only the starting point for building identity.
Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the application of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany should be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical toward Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights.
In the end, NATO held this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, and it is moving from the policy, which, so to speak, to us, to the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent edinaya policy.
Thus, the Germans again are between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that while they only find its role, but are on the road to "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy, which is France or Britain.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to its national interest in the position, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests largely differ from those of other large states, and why Germany must defend their interests.
Whether these economic interests have a position in the Middle East conflict and on the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the countries of the Persian Gulf.
However it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Whether Germany navredila its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure in Europe and even in the US is an understanding of the German position.
However I do not think that it was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany even will acquire thus a certain respect.
It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe, there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the United States and many European states?
In the power of American domestic politics, such differences were always.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But the political situation in connection with the local government, of course, cannot openly to hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion over is not as significant as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not happy with the policy of Netanyahu.
If Germany is to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on one side and the position of important partners in the EU with the other?
I think this is a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there is a neprotivorechivaya, European policy, but now it is not.
However, they may not be in the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
Just as they do with the euro.
I think that, in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that in Germany it is not easy, even because of ties with Israel.
This theme was always fine.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player - not whether she would take on a really major role?
Or a leading role is still hard to give Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, it's always tough to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes on a role, manifested in the various antigermanskie feelings.
The Germans do not just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view of Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US.
It should take into account different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy.
So, America's influence in European politics is subsiding, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, unpleasant or strengthens the enmity to you - such is life!

"the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani polo?
It is officially registered in China, the name that has nothing to do with firms from the names of which it was founded.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not sued.
But even then, it is not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas pattloh, a lawyer specializing in the company of Taylor Wessing violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Imitatoram is to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
Make it lu-gucci instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register a prada-kny.
The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Pattloh opens the folder with records of trademark registration offices in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered there trade mark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also the name of fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
What the Chinese - world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.
In large cities have many-storied department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, no such case pattloha. On behalf of its clients he opposed the order to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the office of registration of trademarks, which has the right to use the name beregu somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "marka-passazhir," Ban minpaj.
It is a word associated with "ban dakuanj."
So call women who are hunting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"it damages the business, with the need to fight," says pattloh.
"while the trademark, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering."
Financial losses and procedural costs millions in the affected areas, especially in the case of expensive kopiruemyh products.
According to the research firm CLSA China market, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury items.
But achieving the removal of questionable entries in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.
Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name became "the reality of the market."
If a complainant is lucky, he will even be plagiatoru must pay damages, as his trademark in China, says pattloh.
Sometimes it is ruled by the law of the jungle.
There is also the famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, shortly before the company, which acquired firmu-proizvoditelya betononasosov Putzmeister.
However, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Kupivshaya Volvo company Geely originally used sine-belyj logo, like the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion goods advertised as lost in China imitatoram from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
Chinese authorities did not feel guilty.
Patent and trademark registration ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.
But in the past year happened "return from an emergency situation in the process to normal."
So, the amount of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production to the agency.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations in the world, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 it paid 1.8 billion yuan Wurden.
If simplify, it means that every check-in/worth an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Appeal against it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated.
However, the simulator secured a Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
It was their own negligence, as the names in Germany are not subject to protection, "writes venttsler, chairman of the board of the Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim myunhentsev.
However, in both these instances Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to struggle so far.
You need to be on guard
Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to bring the case to a good end and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic spending is unlikely to be the accounting firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully proposed the loathly side of the "great shestiznachnuyu amount in euros" for the settlement.
"this makes it clear how expensive it is," says venttsler.
The danger of the far east threaten to spread even in Europe.
And it is in the case of imitation registered there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.
"we need to be vigilant," says venttsler.
As he and attorney-at-law pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be "all that in any way is worth defending, non-personally also in China," says venttsler.
Otherwise, it can do much more than check-in/.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about trademarks, you will have to pay the loathly side of the licensing fees for its own name, explains venttsler.
Otherwise we drive away from the market in the dark segment.
World Aids Day: pritoptyvatj, to sing, to help
In the hajdeljberge Imbongi choir rehearsing AIDS orphans in Swaziland - and celebrate it.
The history of relations who overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First there is stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, pumps and a men's slippers to a parketnom on the floor and quickly find it.
Raz-dva-tri-chetyre.
Only after that slowly growing voices of the singers - bass, alto, tenor and soprano - they occur, charm and follow each other.
Fite and Hopf 29-letnij, the conductor, almost gets out of their materchatyh shoes, when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in the hajdeljberge Imbongi choir rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir rehearsal came from 23 to 69 years, from spetsialistki in human genetics to the Porter.
"ohm"obani" is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a totally alien language: –∑—É–ª—É—Å—Å–∫ohm, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to fight AIDS in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected people.
23,5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland living 245.000 AIDS orphans.
With more than 40 percent of the population wych-polozhiteljny.
For 180 AIDS orphans in esitzheni village of voices for Africa was bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend school, gotovyashchuyu for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in the gogo-tsentre.
Imbongi on the zulusskom language means a narrator or voshvalitelj.
In this hall isn't fluent on the Bantu, zatos can sing.
Nearly ten years for this strange razuchivaet choir soft language and from time to time even takes them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, the distance 8733 kilometers from hajdeljberga, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus Ich.
In a nutshell is reflected in the esitzheni disease of the Swaziland: high levels of HIV infection, the lowest in the world of life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection, almost half of the population is not accepted.
More than 40 percent of the population in Swaziland are the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth selusin is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but above the imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without the school education of people in poor countries have no chance.
At first it was a private commitment of the participants for a few euros in the year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later, the choir founded the "voices for Africa," which has since almost professionally cares for orphans of Aids in esitzheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important disease, sexually transmitted?
The bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (gonoreyu).
Frequent viral STDs are HIV, the human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic pedikulez and scabies belong to the parazitarnym STIs.
What are the main porazhaemye group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.
Among heterosexual adults often vstrechayushchimisya sexually transmitted diseases, are hlamidijnye infection, trihomoniaz, candidiasis (gribkov), gonorrhea and human papilloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among the young hlamidijnye infections occur much more often than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people also often meets human papilloma-virus.
As changing the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007 is declining.
In 2011, it was about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms indicate had venereal disease?
When infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints at mocheispuskanii, selection, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and went unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide 100 percent protection.
As part of the bacteria, sexually transmitted diseases can spread also by contact infection and in close physical contact.
However, experts recommend regular inspection, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
In the early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Donations and patronage, not least royalties for vystuplenija choir across Germany allow something to collect.
"all we have sent in esitzheni for about 200,000 euros," said Annete lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany disposes of the tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares for the orphans were well organized, for example, one of the grandmothers.
GoGos, as they are called in the zulusskom old women, this surrort village.
Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and take care of the children in the form of every day on time appeared on the lessons.
Those who have not left their hanijsile to arrive at the shelter, a lonely woman, receives a salary from proiect, as well as two Cook, who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two hen and jointly with the American organization for the protection of the health of the PSI organized the delivery of analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," said Annete lennartts, "because he is associated with sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, the King msvati III, is known for his love of izlishestvam.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the sanktsionirovannom style of life by the state's wine for the ICH that the virus has spread so quickly in the past few years.
But it is also the stray workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms have literally on every corner, says Annete lennartts, "but they almost do not use.
Another culture - the flesh to flesh. "
Slightly to support cultural exchange, the chorus of ibmogni every two or three years is traveling in South Africa and sings the song, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since apartheid.
The bus, full of White, who sang the song on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even have provoked tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip is also in esitzheni, where singers visit the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on a map in the Valley of the river etsulveni it more than known.
In esitzheni, there is light, "say the people here.
And after the 8733-kilometrovogo flight back in hajdeljberg, when the topayushchie singers return in rehearsal hall berghajmer on the street, you can see that this light burns also here.
NASA's Messenger: merkurii ice opens
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
Ice cover can have up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although she is closest to the sun, there also is the frozen water, as evidenced by the three studies, published Thursday in the journal Science special.
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that is constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
It measures must be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid that may be confronted with merkuriem.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, "said Supervisor probe Sean Solomon.
Temperatures in the merkurii can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life into other places in the solar system.
Insensibly for the inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depth of the universe.
From time to time they send to Earth images: a small window in endless expances.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not "planet."
This fragment Spitzer telescope infrared image is "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the old stars in the form of blue points, is more difficult to identify in a circle of pink "newborn" stars.
This region zvezdoobrazovaniya neromantichno - scientists call it W5 Spitzer telescope - opened in the constellation kassiopeya, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
The dying star photographed the iridescent heat of NASA's Spitzer telescope.
Similar to a donut ring consists of the material, which star threw in the process of dying.
In a gigantic nebul Trifid, a remote on the 5400 light years from Earth, of gas and dust are the new stars.
NASA's Spitzer telescope made the photo of the galactic maternity Hall.
Star of the Galaxy, also called the "seven sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks observer nebul snail on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the continent has brought this nebul the nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides eloquent reproduction.
This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: as they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
This may be pieces of the moon of Saturn, which has disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images from the Hubble Space Telescope: the Galaxy maelstrom
Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the remote for a few thousand light years in the constellation Straltsou nebul Trifid.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trehdoljnyj, trehrazdeljnyj), as dark streaks of dust share in three parts of the cradle of hot stars.
In the constellation zmeenostsa astronomers are the harbinger of a space collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth of the kernel of the two merging galaxies blow towards each other and will inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars removed in the Hubble telescope spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don't like technical cuts may call it nicknamed "the yuzhny tsevochnoe koleso."
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the nebula in the constellation of Iris tsefeya.
Nebul, located at 1400 light-years away, is composed of particles of dust, the dimensions of which from 10 to 100 times less than the usual Tivi dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote to 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A spiral galaxy scientists call was UGC 1810.
In this stellar Nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star cradle constantly creates new stars.
This stellar cloud, united with the tumannostjyu socket, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright fluorescent galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only the gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608, Hans lippersgeem - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes have become increasingly available - and their view of the space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "Hale" in the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The Mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the US, installed a binokulyarnyj telescope. "
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran teleskopio kanarias" has a huge internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The Mirror "big South African telescope" in South Africa segmentirovano - for the sake of cost reduction.
Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tightly to seal under the vertical angle - it limits his mobility.
Telescope "hobbi-eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: the high svetosobirayushchaya capacity.
She reaches - despite a relatively small diameter mirror - the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in the aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to vnezemnym signals in space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by giving its processing power.
The view of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) service in the Chilean Andes.
It is "a very large telescope" is completely appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors to cover in the visual pipe even average infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install a European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should spread by as much as 42 meters, and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
But the photos should not expect before 2018.
Until 2007, both the Keck telescope in Hawaii Volcanoes, "" Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They are two of the mirror with a diameter of ten meters.
"the Keck telescopes" are part of the mauna-kea Observatory, which along with them is looking to the Sky also with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and irttf.
In addition, the mauna-kea should have new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of 30 meters.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important views from space, the Hubble Space Telescope.
On April 24, 1990, he delivers a picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, "Kepler space telescope" is looking for planets outside the solar system - the first such, on which it is possible to life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 planet-kandidatov was found with the mission.
The photos show the Kepler space telescope "cooking."
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 on board of the Ariane 5. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he needs in the light of the first stars and galaxies to look for a big explosion.
The scientists suggest that there is ice on the south pole of mercurius.
However, reliable data on this is not present, as "The Messenger" moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades pointed out that the merkurii have ice.
Thanks to the zapushchennomu zondu in 2004, "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now confident in this.
Drink your oil every day - and live up to 168 years

Many residents in the southern Azerbaijan pau-biblejski reach old age.
Even here there is the Museum of longevity.
The search for solution in a country where 97-letnie men seem still relatively young.
A trip through the talish mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A minibus with gromyhaniem rolls along a winding road past the overgrown with thick Forest Hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
All around the green so vividly that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the southern edge of Azerbaijan, Iran's border is just a few miles away.
Here are the talishs - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which we know little, except that they are speaking in Farsi and azerbajzhdanskom and otlichajutsja longevity.
The final point is Lerik.
A small town flaunts too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost didn't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too utomiteljna.
Of the 323 km—ñ takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
The legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian Sea, here in the province, is not easy.
However, pilata fatulaeva (48) is convinced that the lerike have something to interest tourists.
"in May, Baku has become famous for the Festival of Song contest, and next year we will be the Festival of the people of the world," says fatulaeva.
She is director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen talyshej of these places, which more than 100 years. Fatulaeva ukazyvaet on the black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
In the age of 136 years he begat another child
But the star of the museum is Chaban Shirali myuslyumov, who allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not present.
And given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, the age of 122 years, myuslyumova age is extremely doubtful.
"he was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born daughter.
Make myuslyumov Chaban added a couple of dozen years to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia.
"a lot of people of advanced age can be found in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza in the valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia is also extremely many very old people."
However, because of the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registry of civil condition..
Every day drinkware baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of lerika shockingly often reach biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over the age of 100 years.
Why here in the south, so many long-livers?
The azerbaljani guide Farid mugimzade explains this special talyshej genes.
Museum director fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition.
The talishs love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them for a baked oil every day. But it is hardly a vysokokalorijnaya diet can be healthy with dietologicheskoj point of view.
Or the case in the past, which preserves the lifestyle of the Molodist people in chengemirane, a tiny village "near the town of Lerik, zhivet rubaba mirzoeva.
In 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, which claims that it has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with barrels of oil, which tirelessly ride back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter mirzaevoj, who have long been already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby at the other two babies.
In the kitchen guests prepare tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied drinkware armudu.
The mirzaevoj perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark blond spit, which her son proudly explains to us.
I always have my hair milk, so that they will never slip and preserve the color.
"and I never had a shampoo," says mirzaeva.
A monthly pension of hvataet to life
She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my life I never bought products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army.
It was only after the second world war.
But it was better when "beloved father Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of the old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of Father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins took his son Ilham.
Yet among Azerbaijani elders no poverty.
$230K manates (about the same as the same amount of euro mirzaeva) receives a month as a pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can well live.
And, perhaps, long grew up the son of mirzaevoj is right: "old people in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by the care and happy.
The reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution was back in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show deep divisions of the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president does not scrimp on Pafos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was turned to the people, but in the first turn to the Christian koptam, liberals, enlightened Muslims and has been practiced for non-religious Egyptians.
After all, they still hopelessly disconnected in the rasteryannyj of the opposition, are afraid of.
The fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and broadened its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save 61-letnij engineer with a doctorate in American at the University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles managed to get in the nochnoy 15-chasovoj jump with obstacles on the islamistski configured the constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial system is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean to "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use rasplyvchatuyu formulation and zutritt in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least, it is one of the newest article: in all matters relating to the sharia should be involved for the Council of University ahl-achard, an Islamist institution in the country's great authority in the Sunni Islam.
It should not, but may mean that the clergy nadziraet for the legislation that the de facto would be the consequence of limiting the judiciary.
In a draft of the constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians before military courts.
These courts during the Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in a military prison were to 11.000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is so vague that public institutions with the help of this article can control even the content of the film and literature.
Open Text it means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insult and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insulting and how it should be, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."
Will it be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about lawyers?
The question of interpretation, like a lot of things in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"the revolution is back"
For several weeks is formed the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual fellowship in the evening Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force.
"the revolution is back, and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, took the third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution place "to the dustbin of history."
Through a short news Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters in a desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"if he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem it," said opposition member Yasser has also said.
"we are not tired, the blood of our brothers are not otmshchena," cited the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many of the judges also said they do not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"the Koran is our Constitution"
Well organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the demonstration, but, from the precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of kairskim University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters, who shouted: "the people requires the use of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "ochisti!" and assured the country: "the Koran is our Constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square, where it all began, provoked the state almost civil war.
Supporters of Morsi, obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that as opponents and supporters of the draft constitution was loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamists, it is considered to solve the case.
"the notion of" human rights "is not mentioned even once"
Seventy-hafiz Abu Saeda livid at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
A 48-year-old civil lawyer for Human Rights and the chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (eopr) defended the Brotherhood under Mubarak, when they were in prison or appear before the court.
Not because he shared their view of the world, but because human rights for him indivisible.
For this he was beaten, jailed, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, regrets he in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of government in the state of frustrating attorney-at-law.
These measures represent a significant blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"instead to strengthen the civil state, the de facto president cancelled it," regrets Saeda.
Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For this may come a reckoning.
The demonstrators in Tahrir Square, warns: "you create a monster, which will not be able to control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the bad smell of fish in the world?
The pyatimillionnogo of Norway, one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely zlovonnomu fish dishes?
Take a few perezrevshih pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there in a week.
You could smell the smell of rakfiska otshibayushchij, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered scenic views, it is very beautiful, but spread in the air is the characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout, posypannaya salt and brodivshaya in the water before a year, depending on what you need to duck.
As the global holodaet Twilight and Norwegians, crowds gather at the festival in fagernese, dedicated to the, shall we say, exciting dishes.
"it is eaten raw and are served with glass addition to Aquavit, the local tminnoj vodka," explains Havard haljvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time as a "general" rakfiskovyj, who runs the festival.
All around us people eat threaded small cubes of fish and are served with its large quantities of alcohol.
"someone more like akvavit than rakfisk," says Havard.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I tried a couple of pieces.
If it will be possible to take a piece of the nose, then it's not so bad - differs little from a portion of the land, which you long was driven to a bus.
Rakfisk is the product of an entirely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish soak in autumn germeticheski closed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly zabrodila, and priglushiv, to her perception of alcohol use in food.
Even on the memory of the last generation of the fact that thousands of people were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants who are here jobs, high wages and developed the social security system.
Residents of Sweden (himself a longtime rival, and it was not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, though a few of the element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the world, and the majority of the country seems to be satisfied.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and right-wing extremists, in the past year, rasstrelyavshego and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not mentioning his name, the attack is called "what happened on July 22."
Norvezhtsam is very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's well-being of Norway lies growth (since the early 1970s) one of the most major oil and gas industries in the world.
"but oil is not the only reason of our prosperity," said Anna, our waitress, raznosyashchaya trays with is rakfiskom, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We the people - as you call it - level-headed.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We do not like doing the show, we do not hvastlivy.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil is a big part of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when the sorili money, which they have not been, Norway is economical podschityvala all costs.
"as long as you can ski in the winter and to go hiking in the summer, enough for happiness," says Anna.
"and there is rakfisk," she added with the carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food - rakfiska with me enough.
Here's a burger with losinym meat is certainly the exotic delicious, juicy meat.
But in the evening, we expect more of the same fish from the unforgetable smell.
In my hotel is dedicated to a special dinner, rakfisk, during which visitors vote determine the best or, perhaps, the aromatnuyu fish.
Ciccom is teleefir, which show the lead in bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfiskom.
It is like the Eurovision song contest.
"so, thor-j√ºrgen, how you put the estimate for the best fish there sebja in the mountains?"
"yes, Havard, here is our assessment...."
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from her chair, perhaps through addition to Aquavit.
And maybe, just nadyshatjsya the smell of this fish.
Mexico's President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto faces a tough start of his career.
While the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is due to join in the post, a correspondent for the BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and on mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City is in particularly poor condition.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best of times, and Monday were erected the steel barrier, the pererezavshie several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, it was not done in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests to get to the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Pe√±a Nieto wear a sling and will take the reins of the country.
Before him is no easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calder√≥n, which now folds its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed about 60,000 lives.
"my government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to fight violence," said earlier this week, Mr Pe√±a Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements before next to the US president's political career Mr Pe√±a Nieto developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland in the country's populous and vast state of the country's capital, opinions about the new leaders are divided.
Outspoken man
In the idyllic town of valle-de-bravo, for example, about him recall with warmth.
Residents put him in the recovery of tourism, the development of the resort industry and building infrastructure.
You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built g-ohm Pena Nieto, which are very different from those roads with vyboinami and yams, which were previously on this place.
A placard with his name hangs on a modern building sports centre on an impressive and interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"we associate with him hope of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally by Gabriel oljvera Hernandez, a congressman from the state headed by Pena Nieto institutsionno-revolyutsionnoj party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman oljvera admits that after his 12-year-old absence in the presidential palace los-pinos party has high hopes for Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
In addition, he dismissed accusations of bessoderzhateljnosti, which has a new president of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very devoted to the realization of its vision of the future of the country.
It is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of nesaualjkojotlj, also known under the name sjyudad-nesa, is the most startling contrast with the valle-de-bravo paved streets.
Hidden under the estakadami highways, he in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality also are severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the pacification of gangs selling drugs in these areas were brought troops; and violence against women is here especially acute.
To survive the vast landfill only in the past two years, was found dozens of bodies of dead women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico City during a particularly proud of its Mr Pe√±a Nieto is much higher than the figure in the notorious proslavivshemsya violence the city of Ciudad Ju√°rez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr Pe√±a Nieto about him, in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to deal with the problem of murders of women.
In the worst case, his administration has been accused of complete disregard for this problem.
A resident of concrete-mixing house, like most of the houses in the obvetshalom district, irineya buendiya could barely contain her tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter mariany moon-were.
According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, had committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her cohabitants have.
"when I got to her house, it seemed that her body before this washed," recalls Ms. buendiya.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body is already okochenelo.
Mother mariany tells this story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which the written one word: Justice.
This, they said, was denied this family.
"officials of the state has been with me, as with the old spletnitsej narushiteljnitsej, with the peace.
They want the people just have to believe everything they say, and maintain a low profile.
But it is wrong, you can't make, especially when there are so many violations and deficiencies, "she said.
Wearing a sling on Saturday, the president of the presidential Nieto Pena, together with it will assume the major responsibility.
For the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to address the problem a priority during his presidency.
"I hope that he will be just as President, what was the governor," said oljvera valle-de-bravo, a congressman from the PRI.
But this is what is most wary of the victims' families in the sjyudad-nesa.
Bradley Manning not complained of mistreatment, said the indictment.
Prosecutors are trying to refute the claims Bradley menninga about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, special attention was paid to the presence of the menninga at the military prison in kvantiko, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the terms of menninga were brutal.
U.S. Army private accused in the kidnapping of several thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that the private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in the history of the United States, not used many opportunities to file a complaint on the mistreatment, which, he said, he had to carry while in military custody.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in fort-mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Maj. eshden Fein said that the menninga prison administration representatives of weekly visits for the first nine months of his detention in kvantiko, Virginia, do not contain complaints of mistreatment.
Cross-examination in the framework of the asylum protection on the menninga case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the next day after Manning said that custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military specialist on the analysis of intelligence data, was arrested in June 2010, is accused in the kidnapping of several thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks resource not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During a hearing Friday in the prokuror Fein together with menningom looked at the reports, which were filled menninga visits after administration officials during his stay in kvantiko prison, where he was on a strict regime of from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison menningu asked the questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about reports, Manning acknowledged that the appeal to themselves in the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Most reports do not contain complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that menninga directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning said he expressed concern about these problems and spoken that visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but not fix it in writing.
"they did" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in an interview," says Manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked menninga why he not complained of ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during the meeting of the commission, rassmatrivavshej suicide intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that it was stripped of the "prevention of injury" and cushioned the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - to a level below the regime supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the security of others.
"I wanted to give the administration know that with me all right, so they canceled the warning traumatism... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months before it was transferred to a prison at the naval base in kvantiko, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very difficult when you don't know, how do you solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"my world shrank to base camp-arifzhan, up to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
 "I thought that I will die in this cage."
By being kvantiko, Manning said he spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning said he was allowed to leave only mattress, blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime defy the rules.
According to menninga, while sleeping in the eyes of him constantly beat the light coming from the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he perevorachivatjsya* in bed at night, that, in his words, his budili and were forced to roll over on his back.
Attorney-at-law menninga filed a formal objection to the illegal treatment with menningom in January 2011.
In April 2011, menninga was transferred to a military prison in fort-livenvort, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked menninga about a statement he made during testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in the kvantiko, it have forced to stand naked before security guards and other prisoners on the morning verifcation.
Manning said he does not have to hide behind a blanket during the tests.
Responding to questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the command of the Guard, which must throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one does not directly ordered him to drop it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he poses no danger to themselves.
Manning said told the officer that would use the gum trousers or slippers to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, according to menninga, his underwear, slippers and sunglasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hope the judge, at least, given that he had to survive while in detention, and substantially reduce the sentence in the case, if Manning is found guilty by a court, which is to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year.
Protectng said it plans to offer menningu to accept the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon argues that Manning was held in kvantiko in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the strict regime.
Among the charges menningu, are aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination - the story of Mexican Americans.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of a country about difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin caught between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I went through the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and was on the spot.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for the Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called meksikantsem.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves irlandtsami, and friends from New York feel Italians.
Later, I focused on the complex structure of "Mexican Americans."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for a name or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
Because I took out his American passport and was in turn for extranjeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were familiar to meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president of the Pena Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign an agreement on partnership with the US and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of the Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals was not.
For Mexico's relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the barrel of a rifle forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But the Mexicans have for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
It is only a statesman of the us breathe a word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that the Americans posyagayut on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of the Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy.
The most complex are Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the insults?
Them enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for the opportunities, and those for whom such opportunities not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of anyone - father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
It often were Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion, undereducated, from poor farming families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, saw it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination confused and unclear, but we know what the country as its.
The United States of America.
Moreover, we know that most of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us a reminder about the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as the fake Mexicans.
We don't speak well, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have.
We were not be now for a silk curtain, finding in the US syty life, but losing the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between the real by Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there are certain tensions - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin is upset.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans feel no affiliation to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose the roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the US call us by Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans to the Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US.
We could tell their druzjyam-amerikantsam about what it is a beautiful country and it's great to visit, and it could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will come out of it.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with this castigationelf, amigos.
And rightly so.
If part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they were received with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in the offence for the way recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I felt.
The old battle in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas can become fragile foundation for further peace
It might be a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
A sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its eternal conflict in the Middle East have change.
To this can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab Spring zakruzhili in the rebellious storm of many established Realia, with the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to stay away from the vortex, shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
But there are reasons to hope for a way out of this impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the present situation gives no cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be dur-ing this week clashes only strengthened the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, said from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents locked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is pursuing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time works for them.
As the rise of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the world's richest and developing states of the Persian Gulf.
Torzhestvuyushchie Hamas claim about creating around Israel Islamist crescent - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by a notorious paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more proislamistskie rebels to overthrow the government of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king's power by allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the president Muhammad over Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, the organization, by contrast, is in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms Hamas was defeated.
Israel's "Iron Dome" anti-missile system justified its costs at its creation and successfully destroyed many of the derelicted Hamas missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its unchanged position; many European countries also laid the blame for the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall, which comes on the west bank of the Jordan River is a significant part of the non-recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party - in preparation for ahead of the January 22 elections - reunited with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of the avigdora Lieberman, very convenient.
What's the point to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If put in the hands of all power in the West Bank, not whether they will run out of missiles in the direction of Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.
Perhaps, the supporters of the "hard" line victorious; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab Spring.
The fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel's defense part of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of the war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not less, should consider the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like bus vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv on this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and istoriko-demograficheskii is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For violent operations, which are held every few years in the territory of Gaza to crush the Hamas movement, must pay the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need in the external pulse
It remains the only solution, which constantly encourages sensible representatives on both sides, and much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two states and concessions Israel territories in exchange for security.
It remains a hope, not too impressive in the short term, is the hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which it is time to take the decision to cut off weapons in Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, taken in 1967 with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, the result of which can become the recognition of a Palestinian statehood.
His role in that forced Israel to the negotiating table to play and President Obama.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to solve this problem.
It is a catastrophic nedaljnovidnaya position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the entry into force of the law on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and the image of the body parts in contrast allocated on damp green boxes are identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian odnotipnoj law on the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same unylo-olivkovogo color with a nasty snapshot of affected parts of the body and images of children, which undermines the health of their parents' smoking.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between a imposed mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving drop the habit of fashionable status.
The basis for this decision was the results of research shows that people don't start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.
"it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains the health minister Shenzi Plibersek, citing research showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures are already considering and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
"this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his pioneer," said Scott makintajr, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette case and silicone cases, where unpleasant pictures on the packaging, grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra Ha, the company Zico already implemented around six thousand products to wholesale trade and expects the new party.
For us, this is a good business.
The potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among those parts of the population, which sent on these measures.
After taking in Australia of a number of laws to make illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting the display of cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it may not limit in this foreign sites.
"if you trade tobacco and you have only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet you will find very attractive," explains bechi Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in such social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this is the work of an average citizen who so loves of Marlboro cigarettes, which did not spare time and effort and made the video, or is behind this campaign?
Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new rules: these states are suing claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all of these countries are poor.
The WTO is expected by the middle of 2013.
According to Shenzi Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to make them similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first obyazatel'noe of the photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is a rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovation.
These pictures of me not graze.
I just don't pay attention.
"just a cigarette and hide it in your pocket," explains Viktar El Hague, who buy gadgets cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth on the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter.
James Ju, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the center of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the task of goods on the shelves
"before I have landed on the new party left an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"the government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, well, it's over, close shop," he says, vskidyvatj hands up.
Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
In this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane revealed the mechanical problem and replaced by another plane, which we and wait.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines., no iPhone, nor even a duty-free shops.
But lately, more and more scholars and experts on child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.
And because in the modern world we all are constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom are passing us.
Maybe we should strive to boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time is not present.
We will come back to it.
Before I, like many, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times when people have more free time.
Not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls of pompeyah found in Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
It remains an open question how we understand the tedium.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York, in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often change.
By studying the materials research on this topic and ask the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the next definition: boredom is when the people want, but cannot do that would bring them the satisfaction. "
The difference between boredom and fatigue, he says, is that skuchaem people not to do something that would like to do.
I don't want nothing to do with apathy.
The main in experienced boredom, he says, is "a violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in mood and a sense that time is as slow."
In the description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood says that despite a possible connection between these states, skuchaem people see causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people in depression, see problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored when, in fact, we just hard on something to focus.
In his study "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, which participants listened to a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not assigned to the case of tv-programs included in the next room, others have heard these same completes-the on low volume, so that they can barely read, and a third group listened to only a voice without any sound track.
Those participants who have heard TV-set with low volume, noted that they were bored, are more likely than others - it was hard to focus, but they did not know the reasons and attributed this boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of gveljfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do anything uninteresting, "for example, look in the flow of products on line in search of Marrige, otvlekayushchaya music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he continues, that when people start swaying on a chair or draw scribble on a piece of paper, they do it from the boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"research has shown that children who do not forbid fidget and go round, learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight," said Professor Fenske.
In any moments we all experience boredom: in the event of a delay flight (as in my case), listening to a dull speech, browsing in the film.
But different people have different levels of the propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special "scale of the propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and speaking in a monotone" or "me too much interesting, so anything not enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that skuchaem boys more often than girls, "said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers in general often miss.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven-eight times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens reported that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they get bored outside the school.
While only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data about what would be similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents do not allow fully address than they do.
Back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, research shows that it can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or the abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich to study this problem more than two decades.
"so our brain tells us that we should do something different, and this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know than it is better to do.
If you are bored and you point this energy to play the guitar or culinary experience, you make yourself better.
However, if you get to watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will be.
However, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom independently or in any way in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor Fenske.
"as such skills of independent regulation used in different situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to borrow something, he is also studying samokontrolyu at all.
I don't think boredom must somehow elevate.
But consider it a bad thing is not worth it.
Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree with it.
"we see it is that we need more experience boredom, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, neutolimoe desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax.
"in today's world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when we teryaemsya the silence and do not know what to do."
While it is unclear how it would apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthoney Orozco, the player of the football team and the student public college in the southeast Colorado accused of committing criminal offences, essentially that soon will be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.
Mr Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamare and was driving in the car on the prairie near the border with kanzasom, when they had been stopped.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco came on the court for drug possession and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, for each of them due to a fine of 100 dollars - and a date of the meeting.
"we are treated as criminals," says Mr Orozco.
But whether it criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for a few weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small trials depends not so much from the law, but from the point of consideration.
Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana use, already charged in hundreds of cases, here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped to prosecute people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks of the law comes into force.
But in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases associated with marijuana use, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug.
At the same time in some cities of the suburbs of Denver to vote for the western mountain areas to prevent the emergence in their places of new, licensed state stores in the sale of marijuana.
"all of this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect further," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of the denwer.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington tozhe ozadacheno pochesyvayut head.
They will form the rules to determine the order of the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment.
"in Colorado over an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example," explains Brian- and Smith, a representative of the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr Smith than to any proposals and hope that it will work.
"we have no real precedent on which we could find," he said.
The bill Washington State named I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and the whole year plunging olginskaya into a state of uncertainty, when there is no government licensing system, and the right of possession of marijuana is legal.
And there are only difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between the state of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana from a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and playschools.
"it is especially difficult will place licensed companies to trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly formed research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
On November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora sent to subordinates in an e-mail message that the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to account for the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police stop caught people in these violations, "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance in the city of the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and drug distributors.
Prosecutor Okrug Weld in northern Colorado, Ken tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage use of its people to undergo a course of treatment.
In this moment of 119 persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"the duty of our institutions - to pursue for actions that are considered criminal in the moment they are committed," said Mr tank in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places like rural Okrug Mesa, where the vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the District, no longer attracts the responsibility of adults for possession of small amounts of the drug.
The district attorney Pete hauttsinger supported that decision, but also decided not to take charge on already open cases connected with storage of marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law until he will not change is our primary responsibility," he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, take part in the vote, supported this decision, benefts marijuana use for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
And in spite of the reaction of people in different places of the state's economic state of relations between the local authorities to experiment with marijuana.
"the county prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier," explains makalister Sean denverskij, a lawyer convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana.
"they are so long persecuted people for it, that now cannot really accept that this is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of drug legalization.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the legalizovannoj trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for guidance from the federal government, which still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Department of Justice to give in on this issue.
Despite several received a wide arrests of traffickers and patients use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave permission to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be bursting-in in the House to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they hardly will turn a blind eye to regulatory authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so could not open earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, advanced to the six-month ban on trade in marijuana use, which is likely to be approved next week.
"we do not want to be in this position that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and the casacara voted for that.
There is still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella uajett: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views began today.
How much I myself remember, always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world of educational institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient zakladyvayushchij symposium, two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the historic vusterskogo of college at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I collected my bags and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't pass and burst into tears.
Friends were confusing.
The newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I quit college because I didn't like it that my classmates have sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the ≈°ƒçerbatihs cups.
In fact it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I was systematically and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in a private school.
I was only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle consciousness it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased, was a renowned Woodrow uajett adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You ask, why to remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, priderzhivayushcheesya center-right views, is the same persecution.
This institutsionalizirovannaya and constantly growing hatred of the studentam-konservatoram in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, like the one that is available for the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from Corpus Christi College Student Club in Cambridge say their "often actively isolate put personal attacks and make feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the committee on equal rights of the College of additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation is only exacerbated recently on BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment "the country of miracles: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives introduced eccentric and by neo-Nazi.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, who travels in rolls-rojse, wears a silver suit and stick with the silver nabaldashnik.
In the other studenty-konservatory universities complain that they are "scapegoats for raising the cost of their studies."
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives nottingemskogo University, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in the school environment increases slant in the left-wing views.
People, which we do not even know in advance view us with impunity of nerve and unruly children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history faculty Corpus Christi College, which was filed the petition on strengthening the protection, calls this atmosphere of "dull" and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, said that the ratio of student club to the center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"this is a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, or simply to make the normal life of club members," she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I was there in September 1986, timid and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford lihoraditj from hatred of the Conservative Party.
For the year to the university by a former student of Margaret Thatcher deprived her of honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In that atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even stalinistam.
In the first days of the week freshman, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I first felt that for me ahead.
I still didn't know that teachers not only overlooked studentov-konservatorov hunt, but they are happy to take part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and the refusal of the government to apply sanctions against the government of apartheid in South Africa - penetrate walls trimmed with wooden panels audiences.
On my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century in English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"miss uajett," said lecturor, now the late Harry Pitt, "please, or the first paragraph."
The text was me with difficulty, I zapinalasj.
Harry Pitt was very peppery man with a face like a cake.
"tetcheristy damentally is not taught French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.
Other zahihikatj students.
My eyes were in tears.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, unless you are very busy, rotating in society," probryuzzhal Pitt.
I returned to my room absolutely miserable.
In the evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, the second-year student with the Department of English, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative University.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
 "unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
On each of those suspected of supporting the Conservatives will mock.
I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the pervokursnikov-konservatorov pretend that they labour. "
Later, at the local pub, I too cowardly to hypocritical.
I insisted that I not with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
Freshman of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "you're the daughter of a fascist pigs.
You're contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was corrupt, dirty.
"as conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
 "they beat each other, right?"
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals before the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become lejboristkoj and hide their true beliefs?
The coming me three years began to seem hell, full of hardship and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on issues of foreign policy and one of its spichrajterov.
In college he almost never appeared.
He despised him for provinciality, trifles and commitment to the marksistsko-deterministskomu view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"here you are not happy," he said.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and nepredvzyatyh of the capital's friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the cause.
I don't believe.
During his studies in forty-first years there were any political views.
"but it is also the best university in the world," he told zhalobno.
 "there is not capable, only not in the city of dormant spires.
Even my druzjya-kommunisty always behaved perfectly. "
His wet eyes, pomutneli.
"not to take any hasty decisions.
I am confident that this is just a joke.
My heart, if you razobjeshj to the university. "
I was iznurena permanent missions in London and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also a Conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
At the heart of burns from shame, I admitted that "I clean the brains of parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to kill my father.
At the time he wrote two columns a week for publications, belonging to the rupertu merdoku.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and after five minutes of my pursuers had surrendered.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never returned.
I can call plaksoj and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of this anger and intimidation in educational institutions.
The worst that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 Tory prime ministers, but to this day is behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and freethinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance of Glory"
The exhibition "Valentino: master of needlework," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Nachi abaskalj fionoj, klientkami tiessen-bornemitsa and other famous Italian designer
Somerset-house, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, a prinimat exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged it during the opening of "Valentino: master of needlework," triumphal retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 130 dresses high fashion, created his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with its unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Garavani" or sinjore, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt the rare and distant world znatj.
In the first Hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, with personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess salimy Aga Khan to Lord snoudona, including Marie-Chantal, Princess Margaret, Princess of Greece and the UK.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of their social rise from modest tailor from the town of vogera in the north of Italy to kumir of the international "elite."
Be at the Royal Court - this is not a calamity.
"they would not eliminate cigarettes of their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as do some beautiful stars of pop music," says Baroness Fiona tiessen-bornemitsa.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is strong host and guests with generosity and elegancy.
"we all love to come to his chalet in gshtaade," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like marelly Agnelli or eugeny niarhos.
Valentino always preferred elegance of the glory.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valery matstsa, representing the Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria matstsa recalls the charismatic designer.
Once we went to dinner to his home, it was after the Spanish fashion in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy - junior.
The style of Valentino is everywhere, in every detail of his apartment, in its original, in food and in music.
"each of the guests Valentino gave feel important and beloved," recalls the "top Model" with fashion designer whose work began in 1995 during fashion week in Paris.
"he never goes out of fashion, because his sketches are the real works of art," she finishes.
The parade of family trees
The life of Garavani - the story is not oderzhimostej, and vlyublennostej with full reciprocity.
He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries somerset-house was turned into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and defilyuvalo to the podium, contemplating the "universary" of dreams that glitter masterpieces from Valentino, such as dress, which selected the Jacqueline Kennedy for his marriage to Aristotle onassisom, costume, which used the Monica Vitti in "Night," or coat of hair and skin, which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this public blestayut models of such names as Sybille lyuksemburgskaya, Gloria von turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia gabsburg.
Nachi abaskalj and designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was the pants, shirt, vest and jacket from the collection of autumn-winter 1971-1972.
"it was a gift, which I did," said Nachi abaskalj, one of the designer.
"I prefer it to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it underlines our beauty," added the former Duchess de Feria.
I like the colors that he uses: in much of the world and they "fit" to his face.
The proportions are ideal.
Princess and trendsetter patritsia della dzhovampaola d"arenberg also cannot forget the first time dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I will have the age and a reason to put on one of his Mudejar toilets.
Finally came the hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it at the festival in the castle of my cousin, Prince ed'ard de linei.
It was the red dress with a skirt with frills, "bodice" in the fold and strapless neckline.
"it was a dream to come true," says widow Rodrigo d"arenberga.
"Valentino indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and buenos-ajresom.
Princess d"arenberg keeps its festive dresses from the designer with "the utmost care... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories, accompanying his."
"the king of fashion"
The great somerset-house in the final exhibition - wedding dress Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with pavlosom of Greece in 1995.
It took four months and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls its shvej) to make this outfit of ivory silk colors with incrustation pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and film in four and a half meters.
According to journalist Heather John Menkes, vast authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of high fashion, the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the top of the world."
The drugged many years of "lifestyle" of the elite, now Valentino himself is the best representative.
The Knight Grand Cross (the mark of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight Commander of the order of labor, arts and literature, was awarded the Order of the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani collected the same honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"always my attention to his elegance, his calm, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls d"arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago in a festive dinner in the Orsay museum.
He sat at a table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"he was bezukoriznen, there is no time for him."
If it says Princess...

Among them are ANTO Widjaja, one of the 400 miners who make a living prey of the sulfur kavah-idzhen volcano, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day ANTO descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas rising from the depths of the Earth, congeals on contact with air.
Otkolov huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket at the shoulders and Neset them up on the obryvistyj rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, the height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but in that worn gruzchikam takes more than 40 minutes to climb a snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and carefully to find the road, not ostupatjsya and not fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them life, as happened with one turistkoj of France, who started a few years ago with kavah-idzhena rocks.
Miners earn 5 kavah-idzhena with euro 0.05 for every kilogram of sulphur, which extract
Once at the top, they pave a road between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and weary carrying baskets of Shagal, three kilometers to the weights, which mining company raspolozhila slightly higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
It is about the candy ngrimbi, the company which operates in 1960, the volcano and, it is best not to say, of their employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro 0.05) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro 0.05) petrochemical industry, because this mineral is spread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"as is the norm in 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each messengers," explains to us ANTO, which usually performs three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels exhausted, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems mizerom for this inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
30,690,000 Shakhter podennaya "is very high on the local standards, where for the coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary equals two million rupees (Ex/euros)," explains truckers, who previously worked as a Mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day, and the plot was not as dire, but ANTO returned with his family in banjyuvangi, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as massive as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and carried it on yavu, she converted to Islam."
The ANTO asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly has light and had watery eyes because of toxic gases
In my 27 years ANTO spent three years, risking a kavah-idzhene in the sulfur, which is already beginning to take a toll on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly has light and had watery eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano.
This is the price that he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"porabotayu two more years because I want to open a shop or to study French or Spanish," he promises on more than an English.
A punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a reception in the hotel, but instead he does the work of mule.
Sharing dirty wooden hut with other nosiljshchikami, he gets up every day in the two hours of the night, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and glitters in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, the ANTO down in the crater, covering a road lamps, a small podsoedinennym to his helmet, which he bought with their own money.
About 400 porters carried baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company is not mehanizirovala sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment nosiljshchikam, who work at their own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not even get a part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for the picture, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and his lyudej-mulov.
"this work for cattle, and not for the people," said badrusin, a stocky porters, who spent 42 years in the kavah-idzhene three decades since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept the job "as long as can be," because he needs the money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Not go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur burning throat and hum of the eye, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, artrozy, pain in the knees and ulc√®res on his shoulders, which deformirovalisj under the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on his back, unajnik now can only raise 50 kilogram in its 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades are 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck transport on the warehouse in tamansari, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on the narrow path among the thrickets.
"don't go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says unajnik, widely opening your mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, a senior, 30, also works carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what do human mules with kavah-idzhena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"the population of Singapore need to grow."
I husband Patriot, you are my wife patriotka, will honor our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising myatnyh lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying like "let's put Bao (roll) in the stove" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which has made this video BBH, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the entertainment form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to the people, "their national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world on the reproduction of a similar, so we feel that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government has much to do with the launch of the spirits, such as feromonami or organize parties fast dating (blits-svidanij).
Many of these ideas may have been innovative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to resolve this problem, namely compose rap?
1,2,2 child
Who does not take it so lightly, so this is the Government of Singapore.
It spends 1,300 US dollars a year on policy for the inspiration of the citizens on the birth of more children.
The package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, increases of maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore - it is the rich and hi-technology gosudarstvo-gorod in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management on the population, is now on the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the national office on the population, says that the "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"it allowed people to have a wider range of options in regard to life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms boosted the number of bachelor and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to reduce immigration to counter a sharp increase in the population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where flourishes barely hide xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party Singapur got the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling fertility has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to is not so much of a small housing.
For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate sector.
The leadership on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are 46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a holostomu lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build a big family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of domostroiteljnoj firm El developers, says that their "shoe box" sold much faster than the more spacious specimens.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow is increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new standards give more clear for developers who had placed obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Slishkom perenapryazhennye
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of the national birth rate, after talking with singapurtsami, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"people are very perenapryazheny, housing costs, as well as education, and because of that many people this delay," said a young managers.
Other people can have children.
"but it is important for me to have their own time and money," says another young man of 20 years.
The men and women of his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them to have a child.
So, how would the government nor tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in regard to childbirth, the last word remains for singapurtsami.
Personal offline - one in sexvideochat
Confdentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about the "sphere of private or personal life, which have the right to protect from any intervention."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understands the danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which certainly would not share beyond the Internet?
Elperi√≥dico interviewed five guys from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very, in my personal plane, and" the user name and password, "when used his social networking.
"my greatest secrets I wouldn't load in the post," said a decade of Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"this is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I zagruzhayu beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
Also, I have fun with their friends.
"I would not share the photo, which is not mine, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
The boy is aware that bad to publish obscene photos of naked people, crime or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge said he knows of 35 friends who he had in communication, and nine of their folloverov on Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
The mother in the course, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I got Twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if I meet, I just zagruzhayu them," he adds.
"social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or pau-bystromu with their friends," he says.
Without a second thought, replies that never would accept a request from an unknown person.
Would not be with someone who might have recommended stranger.
The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest acknowledges that doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"it doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one to him not vtiralsya in trust and not asked his home address or phone number.
"if I was to pressure or demand, simply remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience that today is known as kibermobbing.
One of my girlfriends blackmail in the social network.
He was threatened, extorted money.
"he never found out who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, not removed the monaten.
"only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or konfuznyh situations.
Yes, I would have made it if the person I don't like or if I feel like it.
"although I know that this is kibermobbing," he confirms.
Key questions
Marjelos Porras, the acting coach who both English and an expert on the education and training, believes that to direct children and teenagers, need to understand that the purpose of social networks - to inform.
"the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the arrival of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras points out that radzim Mark prenski, master pedagogics of Yale University and the author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms for the explanation for the phenomenon.
Digital natives they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still have to learn," she said.
He said that this issue is very complicated, "because we ask to have a certain criteria of what you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, in the age when maturity is not enough for this."
"also that they were selective, while the more important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, is to ask questions that make them think.
"they say that they do not do this, it is useless," she added.
Porras then lists some of the options: there are things you are not told a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, you would have liked it if it published a photo of you like that of the published you about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you podpisyvaeshj party photos, if you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, all it needs to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"beyond the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, as it should be in the social networks," said she.
Vigilance
Estuardo guardiya, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for the heads of families in good faith to read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of these points, they have good reason for talking to children about the opening of the account on the Internet.
"for example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he said.
According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't tell with strangers."
Unasur summit ends without the limskoj declaration
Vi-vii presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without declaring a limskoj declaration, signed by the previously announced and theoretically binding family members.
Efe repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government of Unasur, however, sources from the office and the president's administration indicated on the main page that his surrender after closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
In response to questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was written by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during the brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was all the time is limited.
During the day, only translirovano was in the hall for the press, video presidential assembly without sound with the message "of the private meeting, the sound is prohibited."
A little information, which circulates among reporters, was transferred to the press-sekretaryami of some governments Unasur, present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian.
The only document, common in the course of the day, it was the list of the participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction with hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian president sent an electronic message of the "final declaration of the summit, however, it is about Humala's statement, and not on the official document, which ended with the summit.
Last October, Peru took III summit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA), and in that time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, also was not spread the so-called the declaration, which previously announced.
On the official website Aspa you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings Peruvian authorities have tried to were provided with the transmission system for all journalists, but the limited information.
The summit also ended the joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, gathered on a regional meeting and ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts on Monday in The Hague hearing statements by both sides, in the framework of the accusations, which Lima put forward against Santiago.
"we are going to enforce the decision, which clarifies the differences that we are currently present in the International Court of Justice," said Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be the country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals," said Pinera, and welcomed pozhatiem umalu hands on the background of the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation by both presidents that they flout the international court was right after the Columbia appeal this week bogotskij pact in which it recognised verdiktam submission to the International Court of Justice after the decision of the sea borders with Nicaragua, which she considered wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, dilmy Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in Unasur was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The collecting president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and for closing the summit later in the afternoon on limskomu time.
The head of the state have read the final document, which reported that were taken 16 agreements and were approved by the direction of the 31 project among the South American countries, the amount of the alleged investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements he mentioned, the countries of the Unasur will take "important steps towards the South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreement about the place of residence."
He said that "actions to improve cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty of citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the total and effective way of the risks of natural disasters."
Because Europe is in crisis, "the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist basis and should serve to expand our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Humala.
"we decided to give the group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connection of South America, especially in the rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming a new economic scheme," said the Peruvian president in reading the message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transverse axes on its territory from coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"we hope that the electoral process in this country will be its accession to the Union of South American Nations, which it currently excluded.
The need to Latin America was a region of prosperity and peace, would be United, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another subject, podcherkivaemoj baraclc.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for negotiations in good form on the dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which bogotoj.
"the day after tomorrow (Saturday), perhaps, met with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"we will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"president Ortega, I hope, will be able to say to him that we will rise as much as possible with this civilized and respectful way," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have provided the presence at the inauguration of a new president of this country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
Also at the summit, the ministers of defense bloc previously met to approve a plan of action for 2013, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the issue of the protection of the region.

"South America should learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the aim, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in a vi-vii presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "but now they practically one otechestvo.
He defended, in this context, the project of South American citizenship, which favor Unasur member countries.
"we need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionaly sector who want to get back to us in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has proved, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those lectures, never does not assume any obligation, and we, yuzhnoamerikantsy, on the contrary, sign everything.
"inexplicably, that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian assanzhu.
Correa assured that not sorry about this decision, because he did not betray their principles, and maintained its "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed the process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while the Swedish legislation thinks it is possible to do it through videoconferencing, which could make of Ecuador's embassy in London. "
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have n't spoken with him since he arrived in our embassy, but I told the ambassador that he had a pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
There is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health due to the confined in a small space without the ability to do exercises on the air.
"it affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted by assanzhu June- in the ekvadorskom embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that there were talks in London on the search for a solution to the problem of prison of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, it is the word we use in this case, but there were constant debate.
"this solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garz√≥n, is a series of processes in different European entities," he said.
And argued that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, doprosit in Ecuador's embassy Senor Assange in London or doprosit it on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, "bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"the main enemies of freedom of the press is not spoiled zlodei-politiki, and bad journalists supporting speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that no these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois strany-gegemony not prevail in Ecuador," and added that being reelected, "deepen the revolution for its continued development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be strong and not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of the rule of law," because in reality "it has eroded the legitimacy of the plane of democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considered in addition is "totally justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos is now negotiating with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which turned out to favor nikaraguanskogo maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not followed.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the dispute about the sea borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that the "right for Latin America to apply to the international court, if the two countries agree to take a decision, whatever it may be."
About opportunities to participate as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity "with optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa assured that if loses the election in February 2013, the faded from public life.
Personally, I was never interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be fixed only by the political power.
"my political movement believe that I guarantee this probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility," he said.
In the case of the victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we move out of public life.
If we lose, the same.
"this decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President nikolasom Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which has already been scheduled, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"this does not mean the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
The mortality rate from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like deafened by," he recalls the difficult, despite all the time with a doctor, moment.
V.spivakov concealed it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible and his efforts to materialize - he already celebrated its Forty-third birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "old" patients wych-otdeleniya hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis "of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years in the early 1990s in it would be hard to believe - then there are too few treatment options, too little known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
Even so, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence.
Now you can survive with this syndrome and do it, not worsening quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, still many people come when the virus has already damaged the, "drew down" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in time, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the wych-otdeleniya hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publications.
Infectionists and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with a life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when reports of 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of wych-polozhiteljnogo at the age of 25 years, according to the term "maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To appreciate this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today in an average of 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in the halisko 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by May of this year, however, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 "why there are still letaljnye outcome?
 "personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine so things in our hospital.
At least the past 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about his infitsirovannom condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunisticheskuyu infection; that we need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all of the people who it will be."
In its proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in the halisko (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in private laboratories, pobuzhdennyj only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
All changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think will die, and did not want to know.
"times are still die, the better I will nadiratjsya three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of themselves and the other people," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with the Milenio Jalisco to prompt his statement of those now in the context of World AIDS Day, is afraid.
Let the proveryatsya, if there was a risk of infection, may soon learn whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, was responsible.
It is his message said the theme of the struggle against AIDS in this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between the health programs and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from of the city of Guadalajara, which started a problem with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places on this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us the hundreds of packages, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"why are you?" is a popular question, with ehidstvo and condemnation by social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured communicator.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only over the counter and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places which are often visited by young people.
This does not encourage promiscuity.
It is not about the payment of beer and a motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is it possible condom distribution in its leadership.
"this is not uality, it is best to make condoms available to those already practicing sexual activity," he said.

An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as the one known case is from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.
Given the ratification of the court of appeal of the United States of the decision, which cancels debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through the competitive production in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country, which has a solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms that are Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the judgement on June 15, Judge Harlin Hale in the court of the bankruptcies of the Northern District of Texas, leaves unwarlike Mexican firms in the face of possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door to the manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, citing as proof of the three non-compliances.
As an introduction, while the judge the case notes that lenders should be governed by the code of the US bankruptcy, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive production to Mexico.
The first item implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile.
In fact, the model law unifcation was created by the UN international trade law, defined as the arbiter of American Law Institute.
Second, the verdict states that mezhfirmennogo without the vote, approved in a critical mass of competitive production of debt, which is the parent company of Vitro, would not have achieved majority necessary to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time accepted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among them agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed the Federal Institute for competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or the other lenders Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds "vultures" like aurelios capital, aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not achieve the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data to the court of appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which it has since 2008, affected a serious economic crisis that struck the United States, with strikes on the country.
While the firm family Gonzalez Sa'da to appeal against the decision in the court of appeal to the vote came to its plenary session, the five judges, due to the fact that they voted only three.
In the case of failure would be charged the application for certification, which would require a revision of the process from the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (friend of the court "), which describes the in vitro process, which should be in the framework of the law on competitive industries, signalling that he frees himself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the US bankruptcy.
In addition, notes that the country complied principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karambolj from the two boards: they beat in vitro and beat in the country.

Hektor "hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life"
An basket-ball traveler Hektor "hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years associated with this sport, and thanks to him, traversed the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball history as the "Hektor" hetin Reyes.
And because before bleeding in the brain prikovalo him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player, small categories, the player of the mini-basketball league, the commissioner and the chief of the BSN kovboyami with bayamona and the president of basketball federation.
"I have done a lot of roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, when I was the president of BSN, the director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during the visit of the Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all with photographs and memorabilia gathered for his long way show about it.
In the heart of Bayamon
With the emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys since the 1950s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance in the role of so-agent or agent contract.
"it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships Cowboys since 1967, as the agent of the so-agent, or supervisor.
There was a lot of years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN.
Since then, continue to lead became "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, 6'7 growth."
"do you want?"
And it was the beginning of a Minsi, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended that a sniper Raymond gaussa, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship bayamonu Gauss, would help to win another.
Cowboys with chempionstvom gaussom I enjoyed, but already in the distance, because the 1988 already was the head of the federation.
By the time I chose to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements of the Minsi in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time in the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, for which we received the fourth place and it was to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, which made us beat the final game, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best team, what you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the US team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Championships here.
In the team not only again played Minsi, gaussa, Ramon rivasa, FICO Lopez and'pikulina '(ortisa), but also young (Javier) 'tonjito' colon and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and Leon (Edgar) and Mario'kihote 'Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995 in neukene, Argentina.
With role players like'kanito 'njevesa, Pablo alisea and young Rolando hurruitnera in return for disarrangement players, temporarily otstranennyh panamerikanskom championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico do not dominate at this level as it did Pikulin.
And this is without taking into account of his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best puertorikantsem head?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young growth, including Julio Toro, Flora melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like the work of Leo arilly.
What would you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season.
What you need to do?
Were the things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now they travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary.
At least, I see the fruits of a compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, yicabel, which was always with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in fort-uerte (Texas), has become famous thanks to his main role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J. R." in the television series "Dallas," in which he was the symbol of a businessman without principles, evil and manipulyativnogo.
Larry Hagman, whose role of oil magnata-hishchnika Jay AP Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J. R. in the new season of "Dallas," died on Friday evening because of complications caused by cancer, according to the family, made to the Associated Press by Warner Bros., the studio production of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a role, which are like him," said his family.
The family of Larry and the closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair in honor of Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, played the role of his wife in the original series and in the cycle, was close to hegmenom, when he died in the Hospital of Dallas, said her spokesman Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, tender and talented, and I will really miss him.
"he was the original personality and lived a full life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
The hegmena was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he acknowledged that he drank for many years.
In 1995, he discovered a malignant tumor in the liver and he underwent transplantation.
Long before the "Dallas," Hagman become known on television thanks to the role of decent type in light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," translirovavshejsya NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut, whose life is changed when he meets an attractive devushku-jinnah, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
It was also the main character of the two comedies, which rarely appeared in the air, "the good life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "here we go again" (ABC, 1973).
His work included roles in the movie, well received by critics, in "the group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his Masterskaya interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J. R. hegmena led to the top of the glory.
CBS drama series about the clan yuingov and other characters in his environment went on the air in April 1978 to May 1991.
Advertising slogan "who shot J. R.?," designed to create hype around episode, full of emotions, in which the character hegmena nearly killed, spawned international discussion and millions of dollars that risk, betting shops in kancel√°≈ô.
It also helped to bring to the show record audience in that time.
When was answered in the episode from November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him and turned "Dallas" in the second in the number of page views entertainment program in history, after the final "mash-up" in 1983, privlekshego 50 million viewers.
It was svoyachenitsa J. R., Christine (played by Mary Crosby), which shot at him.
J. R. prevented her and then threatened her that accused her in prostitution, if it does not get out of the city, but others too have reasons to attack him.
Ewing played as an Hagman korruptsionera with a charismatic smile: a fraudulent entrepreneur and a husband who wanted his alkogolichku wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), put on treatment.
"I know that should be in a sepulchral stove J. R.", "said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said: "here lieth chestnyy Grazhdanin J. R. Ewing."
It is the only deal, which he lost.
Victoria prinsipal, also geroinya of the original series, recalled on Friday hegmena as someone "a huge, both on and off screen."
He is an indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who were privileged to know and love it.
Ten episodes of a new edition of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success in the channel TNT.
Had finished recording five episodes of the second season and the sixth was in production, said the channel.
Warner or TNT has not made the statement that will be with the show after the departure of hegmena.
A native of fort-huerta, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, which shines in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when delivered it in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben hegmenom.
He is popytal happiness at the New York theater scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the air force England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist may Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put there nothing that found it would be able to hurt someone or to affect them in any way," he told Prensa asociada at the time.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients feel fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go on operations, and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, like "do not be afraid, be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you will be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course, which explores the "end of the world"
Every week students study the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, Zombi, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of Religion Stewart Sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had the irresistible lure: the end of a "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people as a proof that heralded the end of the world.
But fashion had no idea that it expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian theorists believe that will be the end of the apocalypse.
"I did not realize that it will be the an apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharm rutgers-kamden University students this week (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically posledny in history.
In the templjskom University Associate Professor Barry vaker reads the "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week students study the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, Zombi, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"we analyze why these ideas with time travel," he said, and the way offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.
If nuclear material into the hands of terrorists, for example, may be war.
This month, students analyzed movies on apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students that perhaps likely, plausible and impossible," said vaker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is simply called "the end of the world."
"we don't add '2012 'to always be able to read the course again, if there is not the end of the world," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students should learn to cook projects and to take final exams.
In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students a choice but to work "to the same night, which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.
Courses were quite popular.
"the place is for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with high scores, which did 35 students.
We received an email for many weeks before the semester from people who asked, is there still a place.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see that people make to console themselves," said Brigid 23-letnyaya Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from haddonfilda, New Jersey, in rutgers-kamden.
And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or the lack of it.
Will vekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard about the course, which would have taught this," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - not said that it believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"our first project touched the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways it is discredited," said Julie zeglen, the 21-year-old student of the University of templjskom in west-chestera.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is apokalipticheskoe concern in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicted the end of the world.
The Internet has increased the speculation.
"in other places people do not think about it," he said.
Mostly in the anglogovoryashchem world.
Joseph dogerti, a professor of religion at the University of la-salj, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he is on a course about the "end of the world" there.
"the Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal court.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall noticed that for a long time, talked about the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophical that December 21, is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said they would go to parties "of the end of the world."
"maybe call someone from friends to laugh," said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the faculty of communication.
