What will happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor baked in Prague.
The newly elected mayor of the CSSD Capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand at the council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new city council members belonging to CSSD, whether they know the slang that was born during the last years of office, when they were partners in the current coalition who ran in Prague.
Coded vocabulary that the cream of Prague politics started during the previous era's mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, circumstances and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known terms.
Or so they say.
"Who is Valdemort.
"I really do not know."
"I am a greenhorn in politics Prague reacted Kaucky Lukas, elected to the culture to test the vocabulary of the" Godfather ."
And as regards the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression from the ones you are suggesting that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use slang.
Vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.cz published expressions in June of this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, writing chose six examples, primarily those associated with the city of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," go to the pastry, "" Blackjack, "" treason of the capital "and" Entol.
Three of the elected representatives have agreed to the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who should direct the education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I do not mind at all these things and how fun the representatives of civic democracy: I will not give my opinion."
"I am working on how we understand ourselves through our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky apparently did not recognize in the caption above, it is the influence Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á'Kaucky and the only phrase he guessed the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague.
"This tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and immediately adds: "But I know newspapers.
"I will have to pay a language course," joked he says.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment know that the golf hole is the tunnel Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about the meaning of "go to the bakery."
"This, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of companies Janousek.
On the same tone that reminds Brezina derives its knowledge rather newspapers, not any vocabulary he would use.
According to tests the candidates there is no lexicon of slang in social democracy.
"I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have anything of this kind."
"We said earlier names sometimes used abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, that Party members called Hulda.
"They called me Briza at school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The Weinert is elected for Papy Party members or the less friendly little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election by fraud for sponsoring the party, is nicknamed "the little toy ."
Nicknames are also deterred if the only use within the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky Hulda do not like it, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this president in Prague.
"Doctor of Laws from baton" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr.à Police Academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common features.
Rather they are part of the old generation can not work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
One that becomes "witch" is not isolated to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man was very rarely that fate."
"We do not judge young healthy women as they participate in work and child birth," said a sister who deals in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility more than 100 women who were rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this "social measure" unusual.
He published a pamphlet which should help minimize the hunt for witches.
The case involves a snag.
"Over 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can not read," warned the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantage of education in writing.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years died after being tortured by three women and one man and burned him with oil they were sprayed.
This is the server that sent the BBC this information.
Criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version of the oil used for anointing ritual was emflammée in contact with the woman.
The oil has soared, it seems, when the team wanted to "drive away the evil spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all educational levels.
The daily Der Standard quoted a contractor for 42 years in Burkina Faso: "eaters of human minds have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunt, The Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself to attend.
"The Gambian President Dzammi after the death of his aunt, has launched a wide witch hunt, it seems, have participated in his death and would have sought by black magic to kill also the President."
"The Shamans of Guinea close to coming to the rescue, led to strong presidential Kanilai under police protection and bodyguard of the President, men and women randomly selected dansdes Gambian villages," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
At the farm people were imprisoned drink a potion made from plants with hallucinogenic effects that induced in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
International pressure is about one thousand people who were released.
The tenant Bakal: The hot stove, he signed a higher rent.
An elderly man escaped through the imposing gate of the client area of ​​the company's RPG Byty "Coal Baron" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a folder with three new leases for three apartments: hers, his daughter and son that is about to serve a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2 +1 apartment Second Class 4100 crowns.
"And there's no hot water and heating with solid fuel works," pointing to the new contract his son the man who has signing authority.
"But I signed anyway" he explains to Motie angry and half resigned.
The association citizen apartments BytyOKD.cz who described Nouelle lease terms as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice is published to explain the method to follow demand.
But man reacts to this with a hand gesture.
"One says this, another says something else" with a frown.
The Ostrava region is the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic where rents are not at market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
The waiting room of the street Havirovska RPG is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Right next door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number coming from the device.
You do not have time to read your number "157" as your number is already beginning to light up the big screen as topit the waiting room.
In a split second it's your turn.
After a short time, an elderly couple came to inquire about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for reparations, events for insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people of more than 44000 apartments Portfolio RPG receive e-mails with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for the new rent is open to the public since Nov. 18.
"It works for nearly a week, so it's still in testing" replied after a moment's hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer is as a journalist.
The déragulation and former minor apartments Bakal is a local issue very sensitive.
The Deputy Speaker of parliament and a native of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats had a fairly steady state before the elections and it now meets local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They did not even change one could ... n board in the toilet, relieving himself in the introduction to the man mentioned.
However, it is above, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they receive a discount on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a drawback than half the amount of rent that will loctaires others who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the wicket "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska not really overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 ​​guests who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," said an employee at the counter.
Yet RPG porpose as on its website that in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties fail to agree on the rent is an independent tribunal that will decide.
'It's not only threats but to inform on how unique and legitimate act legally, "says RPG on its website.
"Here nobody will go to court" thinks one of the workers and PGR Byty man in the street outside the center gives customers reason.
"I have 13,000 crowns pension and I still have 5000 Crowns to eat, I do not have to go to court," he said.
An employee who suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek media calls and no sign so people waiting," says she says.
The regulation of rents in the Czech Republic ends with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according RPG Byty are an economic necessity.
"And, again, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for simple maintenance of funds for housing," said Pavel Klimes, director of the company's residential portfolio Byty RPG, that is precisely the neglect fund for housing which makes the angry tenant is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 with the RPG was able to invest in rental apartments 4 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the armchairs upholstered waiting room Havirosvka Street, however, repeat some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and for not less than 31,200 apartments over 90 percent of apartments RPG.
"And it will always be up to CZK 7.50 per m² per month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 percent applies only to the portfolio of 400 apartments RPG.
"In these cases, there is an increase from a very low amount CZK 19.66 per sqm," said RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not lead to an increase in radical but progressive in 4 to 8 years.
It adds to other commitments, all the money from rent increases (see graph) is delivered to the apartments as heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase are given priority.
The nursery school is part, too, offices have included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new corporate headquarters Arch. Design.
Nobody would have expected it also houses a mini nursery school with everything you need - colored walls, furniture imaginative toys, and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can reach the children of employees of Arch. design.
The company projects architectural Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagined her mini nursery business since the early drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of the age to have children and it was important that women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as contracts-time work decreased, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work with taking care for children.
They are employees of Arch. Design.s themselves who invented this kindergarten and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is funded by the European Social Fund resources through the Operational Programme Human Resources and State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up from 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and appliances after two years and provide qualified staff and the initiation.
After using the allocation of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. is required after 3 years of operating the mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and is the Economy rating company that has helped make the staffing request.
Care for children is provided by qualified personnel, all day nurse and a kindergarten teacher working with children. children can go to kindergarten regardless of age but they have more than three anspour most.
As this is a "mini nursery school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that can be replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to hierarchical position.
Although s'agise an individual care and education, the program of the mini-school is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not make that play, but quality education is also provided - from start to prepare for in school are taught in English.
The classroom is equipped not only toys and imaginative play but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive.
Parents may at any time and monitor their child does not have the stress of a delay in picking up children in a school away from the workplace of the parents.
Parents therefore use their time working in the most productive.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between employee and employer.
Arch.Design.s is well placed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees that are friendly towards the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of HR.
The house still fascinates bone after 100 years. Look in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric reptile, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and balconies with open mouths of fish.
Thus was the Casa Batllo in Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname of the House of bone.
Organic shapes, colors, wild, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade recalling all these scales and curves, that is all that is ypique for Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house held her dream lines, colors and textures that recall the pleasant nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation shows the geometry, the pace and order thought with precision.
During the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the printing of color brilliance is enhanced.
The winding and twisting forms also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood copy Wave window frames, balustrades, decorative doors, and the eyelet strips.
Batllo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia to the number. 43, was born of building a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction was done for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Batllo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and build another brand new but quickly accepted the idea of ​​a reconstruction of Gaudi unusual and cheaper.
But the idea of ​​Casa Batllo as multi-unit house was not thought by Gaudi himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
Precisely on the project that were born the decorations for a flat representation of the owner of the building and use of tiles to the facade.
For the front also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work plans for the Casa Batllo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in building the home of Gaudi's Casa Mila and Park Guell, where there are other works by Gaudi.
The premises have called home just after hot finish because of its organic forms "House of bone.
Further, given the specific mechanism for opening windows have called "the house who yawns."
It is said that the top of the building there is a sword like that of St. George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi designed to house a unique time in his central heating, with air vents and chimneys typical.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi has absolutely failed to comply with construction guidelines then and did not let them interfere with.
At the beginning of the construction it received from the city building permit, knowing of course that the information contained in the reconstruction plans were so vague that during the two years after finishing the council was horrified and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after calling the city Josep Batllo asked (and obtained satisfaction) the authorization to lease the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and third bedroom and a private area of ​​the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is divided by a staircase that provides access to a roof terrace independent.
All right angles and straight lines were canceled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replacing them with curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the concept of modern spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of high society salons and can communicate comfortably or limited private space for intimate conversations.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received new facades off a roof and two floors nontraditional and more.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is decorated with the skylights.
The game gives a maximum two colors of light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to wager on the principle that white reflects more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Batllo, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage Fund of UNESCO can be seen by everyone.
On the first floor of the apartment house is the most spacious and most beautiful public access.
The owners have decided to take that step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits because they found that it is a lucrative business and they have extended visits to the attic spaces and including the roof terraces.
The ticket in the monument is really cheap and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders 20 per cent off.
The amount is still above the entry price in other buildings in the city of Gaudi.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with turrets fantastic, you must quickly find a friend among the residents of the building completely and go home.
How to choose a mattress and box spring: women have different criteria than men.
No part ostentatious, but rather the quality of the area set aside at bedtime, so the mattress and box spring provide a real basis for a good bed.
Obviously, they must complement each other harmoniously to appeal to a specific user.
During the selection several things are critical, the weight, size, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of procedure in which we will place the mattress and box spring is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not adequate because they "warm up" slowly.
They have, moreover, being heavier than standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to return often.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, and more on a solid plank, they retain moisture. Mold can also be formed there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
One who spends most of the time abroad, where it frequently uses very thick mattress with a layer rammollissante, feels good on a hard surface low and hard.
"Thus all hokei returning from NHL complain they can not sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, legs and ribs, they needed a mattress with a layer of foam rammollisante lazy.
"These mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system therefore assume wrong" information "of the joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova that specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with foam lazy conquered the hokei and other customers.
"Today everything worked well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have such appropriate mattress.
You do not need a guy for the NHL to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you do not return the night after a tough match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam works well as protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For beds in one place, the singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient for those visiting.
'But it is a simple rule for the width of the bed where you lie on your back you should place your hands so comfortable with elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of saddlers-mattress and decorators who has spent the past several years the issue of a sound sleep and ergonomic furniture and taught in special schools.
For a double bed each needs its own box spring and mattress, so be careful however as the purchase of choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will then go to the mattress at different heights and it is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattress at least 15 cm, this plan for the subgrade and ventilation for at least three centimeters.
"In touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helen Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a definite type of mattress.
The bed mattress when the mattress and box spring are joined like Siamese twins, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
The mattresses are aired very evil one does not wash, which is commonly auhourd'hui.
And since the night you sweat normally from 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress starts to remember a great (and plugged) sieve.
Why experts refuse to advertise on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all but his.
And for that board experience on the part of sellers: a mattress 120/140cm, renounce, for covering mattresses, hygiene or washing but rather add a cushion of protection as Youmay easily remove and wash .
And even if today it is common to produce coatings with a zip to the whole set, ie after the opening we have two parties (for washing and the size of a washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for one person) when removed becomes a fight between a lightweight and a heavyweight in the ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a mattress?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for a single night.
However equip the board (if there is none) of air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs kits (Taschenfederken Germany) and a layer of cooling.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
Mattresses for single-position slats with 14/18 blinds, latex mattresses and so-called sandwich (maybe a combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it is always better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the bottom part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate stiffness.
For multi-position mattress should not take spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
Besides adjusting the stiffness of the blades can also install what is known as a cradle shoulder.
This is a special link that allows the blades to push or to tilt the blade to the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back" is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by manufacturers of mattress for "men" have begun to use an area rammollissante at the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer them a new softer surface at the hips.
For the customer the most difficult there are mattresses or pads with wings what is called a suspension Multiforce.
The pressure spreads into more points and diinue tension.
But of course, be careful, when you use a bad pillow (large and filled with air) on a good mattress and box spring, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is simply a pillow: pillow should support the head and legs should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm as the Scandinavian example we prefer.
When one is lying on its side, the pillow should be upgraded (with cradle shoulder of the bed or mattress in the area rammollie) shoulder height.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first based on straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is the mattress organic.
Raw materials from petroleum, from which it manufactures polyurethane, are replaced with natural oils such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use just soy.
"The term Bio mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," said Petr Vasicek society Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for coatings mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the plant extract of birch for the blanket covering absorbs heat and cools the body, "cool" man, coatings "hot" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorite?
Mattresses made from foam cold (it has more pores with a cellular structure perturbed therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities cold foam mattress gives polyzones who know exactly where the head, lower back and feet.
You'll pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those parameters are characterized by their health have less VAT and are used as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic is Gumotex which reached the top spot.
Save for the mattress and box spring is not simple.
It can occasionally be part of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
Such as the company that offers Magniflex Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam liner sewn to 11,990 crowns.
We can obviously take the second one free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a pace "cosmic."
It started as a material for NASA astronauts underwent becaufe start huge load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and hardens, however, refrigerated.
It fits perfectly to the human body warm and it distributes optimum pressure.
It is therefore ideal against evil and slept for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for the mattress but also for health products, such as special cushions for the feet and legs which relieve the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use such as foam or EucathermC Twinsaver or the like.
Devices to track people are increasingly sought by parents who wish to supervise their children.
Fear for their child brings more and more people thinking about the monitor through a GPS.
The system, developed initially to search the cars may as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for certain cases such as that of the small exmple Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of small Anicka has moved many people and they began to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We're trying to tell everyone that he is not spying but just another way to decrease the probability that there is another tragedy," said Petr pilin society MAcro Weil is a supplier of aircraft tracking on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be instances of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who does not know, but I have not encountered such cases ."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons, said pilin.
He says children should always know what is used for "the box" and how to use it in emergencies.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova attracts attention if the child does not want to wear it on something like this, get rid of it.
'And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they purposely do not want to be under control. "
"Mobile phones, which can be cut as these aircraft tracking, has already led to many parents' expectations," said Bockova.
She said the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"In the case of an abduction prepared, the author will do everything so that the child has no electronic device that can locate."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"When will develop the equipment tracking, they (criminals) are going to try them too, because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals are always ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits nonetheless that such devices can help during an attack unprepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both passenger cars and people said that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in case of aggression .
"The camera can be set so that it is in regular issue after a specified period.
"If the aircraft was destroyed, there is still the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and found himself lying down without moving, "said Cech.
According to him the so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatted with special software packages.
The problem tracking systems today is that it is a device similar to those that are worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or smaller to telephones.
You can always lose them.
According pilin society Macro Weil is why tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any aggressor will not recognize the camera tracking.
"Either he will realize after a while, which has given the police a little longer," he adds.
The unit plot is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it utilisiera always the same technology to track cars.
It is a combination of systems to acquire a position using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a cell phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so detonating it could go around with the Czech Republic. But it can take two years.
The military bought for 445 km from detonating the explosives used.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army then reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cord is two to four years maximum.
The army has purchased detonating the STV Group company for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for buying a huge quantity of detonating cord to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to calculations of reserves to hold the fireworks made by the army, that approached MF DNES, it appears that even the generals, officers with command, staff secretaries or household should have an annual exercise to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army is no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km from detonating.
At that distance is 25 000 explosions.
And even if true, the army reserves could meet them for 10 years.
If instead it were true that the basic training of new professionals each just to over 2 m of detonating cord, as experts say this means that the army with his new purchase was insured - also with consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to the Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their guns and the shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
About the lack of underwear is not mentioned.
"And I do not take the head if they buy from us so large a quantity of detonating cord.
"And that's their decision and they really know what they do."
"For us the army is a good customer that we work as traders settle," said commercial director of STV Group January Decky.
January Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argued the purchase of hundreds of miles of detonating cord by the fact that the military will have these "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
January Decky STV Group reported, however, only four years of life of detonating fireworks and police and army just two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go even up to four years," said one of two that does not want his name published with regard to criticism of the army.
The period of life past, each munition should be tested to see if it stays clean and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are however not free and cost more money.
The other argument is a discount department due to the amount for 445 km cordeux detonating.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," the spokesman Pejsek who is the interpreter of the notice of buyers from the Department of Defense.
Only for comparison: annual consumption of detonating fireworks of police munitions that neutralize the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed the 1500 meters.
And the police still controls only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their useful life.
It has been established for reasons of safety and fireworks in addition to obtaining a more flexible types of detonating cords more modern and reliable.
the Department of Defense to big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand strong men were preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What lies ahead in a few years that the Czech army has contacted MF DNES: blocking hundreds of miles of old detonating it now buys "cheap."
Until today I can benefit from contacts I obtained through the contest.
The sale of its hotel franchise has helped Lukas Pytloun to place winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneurs.
The winner for Best Solo Entrepreneur for the past year has been Pytloun Lukas, entrepreneur of 28 years.
His journey to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that he lacked a Liberec site quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
Of his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small apartment building with 5 half-demolished.
Knowing he was still studying trosième year of graduate study, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt with foreign workers.
He reinvested earnings in the building he turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his entrepreneurial action allowed him to open pension Liberec 4, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was most recently the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
This year he has reached another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for franchises hotels Pytloun have shown" a number of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a hotel on a large scale victory in the contest of the entrepreneur of the year has served, Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory brought him more popularity and be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognize me in the streets, often praised me, and I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he now uses up his contacts and knowledge he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the contest I started regular commercial relations.
He said the reputation linked to the success has also had an impact on employees.
And he about 70.
"I look at them especially the loyalty and pride for being involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job of us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we've had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been replaced by RPID effects of the crisis.
With the direction of the goal of winning Farmet has the worst behind.
He who came to seek price Slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year hosted by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky the company owner Farmet.
The jury rewarded the effort with which he has turned a tool shop in Ceska Skalice firm in the turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award has encouraged me not only my staff and my also increased our confidence to fight against competition, "said today the winner of last year.
Early in the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky the small workshop to rent as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, declined a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with few peers in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
He became eighteen years after the biggest maker of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialist audience after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only do our customers have started to really learn about the brand Farmet but also foreign partners have begun to realize they are working with a company that has obtained the greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not gone to N'E Farmet LDANS only the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made from the economic results of 2008 and into 2009.
And indeed in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment plans and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"We obviously have not escaped this situation."
"The sales have fallen 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even dismiss," said Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society must know that sometimes you have to take unpopular measures.
But they handled the situation correctly and retained even if the beneficiaries, the results were lower than they had before the crisis.
Farmet however, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built endowments with a training and research have strengthened the presentation of the company in international fairs and exhibitions and won top prizes in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
All we suggesting that the crisis is behind them.
The figures go up and asserting themselves with the number of employees as well.
"At the new winner I hope this good feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
Investigations into the absurdity of the Year for the fourth time is a part of clan affairs.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The winner of this inglorious year investigation into the absurdity of the year was the requirement to produce documents in the offices of the officials can get on-line.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the administration of Social Affairs requested a paper extract from the register of trade, while the staff can get in two mouse clicks.
it changes with the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will not ask for the extract from the Commercial Register when checking insurance payments," said Jana Buranov, spokesman for the Czech Administration of Social Insurance (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the sense of the absurdity of this contest of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the clan affairs organized by Hospodarske noviny and even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters have come forward, it is at least 4000 this year who have made their voices.
And not surprisingly, there is in our nation's most diverse legal obligations which only slow the company, and this, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to complete tax returns for the first places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank Czech Republic is located at 74 th place as regards the conditions for the company, or 8 more seats compared to last year.
The competition of the absurdity of the year was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year by the same scenario.
Anyone can report each year and bureaucratic absurdities from April to September, the last time before the close of the competition.
To realize there www.firmaroku.cz website. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven nominees for the "antiprix" and let the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz / www.ihned.cz and absurdity.
The Absurdity who received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it's a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
Comments are submitted by contractors but also professional associations and teachers.
Among the "finalists" contest, so among the nominees is for example the requirement that vehicles maintenance of motorways and highways pay tolls, or as contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The seven proposals is posted on the contest website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of a happening involving regular personalities from politics and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises in the Czech Republic Petr Kuzel or President of the Chamber of Commerce Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
'Economic prosperity can not function when the state puts in the legs Aton contractors and my objective is to remove every year at least three dozen paragraphs today only complicate the company " said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, people did not like was the obligation of contractors to declare three days before the office to the individual enterprise to the place where the company intends to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This requirement was abolished with the Act Ammende sole proprietorship.
The second obligation is the most acclaimed in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office travel service for a foreign employee on 30 days, was removed with the text of this Act is called the green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, refrigerator and two automatic scales.
That was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-Requirement to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category recognizes the socially responsible firms.
Are valued ecological projects, humanitarian, education or sports.
The novelty of this year's contest Hospodarske Noviny, which has existed for 5 years, is the category called the firm responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif this competition is to support the company reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the firm Vodafone, which is the guarantor and promoter this competition, as in the case of competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition the firm in 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, signed up companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The story of each is rich with inspiration and a separate article would be edited.
While the focus of their business is different from each other we can consider their support activity and forecasting as the denominator for their efforts.
In one case, this includes people with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is no such company software packages Prague Netera And that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo who is 17 years since the main contributor to the endowment fund which sponsors children with disabilities.
By the way employees deal with health problems, can still quote the old factory Podebrad paper which employs more than 70 percent and, for that, got the title of the firm responsible for Central Bohemia Region and placed third in the region in support of the Firm of the Year hosted by Vodaphone.
A Olomouc is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing more flexible working hours and even decreased to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionately, reduced wages.
The jury also Deverne the title because it buys in priority to Czech manufacturers, supports ditoyenne activity in the inner circle and is concerned about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, executive director of the company.
the company's IT manager basketed Region Usti also think the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop chair and ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the services of a catering protected local factory for his actions.
"We also support the foundation's rights in the shade that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy representative of society.
At the very last row is also for its operations, a Wash and clean the area of ​​Karlovy Vary, which participates in the pension insurance of employees in the form of bonuses above the standard.
"In our society we are contributing to food, transportation, higher qualifications and recreation," said Joseph Strapac the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
Were automatically enrolled in the society category manager, all the regional finalists for the contest of the Firm of the Year Vodafone, which had responded to questionnaires attached document for registration and had returned to the organizer before August 15.
The answers are incomplete or incorrectly filled in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of competing firms did not respond to questions, they could not enter the competition manager of the firm but were not disqualified from the contest" primary "the Firm of the Year Vodafone.
"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the year," said Karel Goldman organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Fund for Land in Plzen, police made arrests in a public competition
In the building from the Land Fund in Plzen, police anti-corruption arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed to the local contractor and commercial real estate Lubos. G.
The latter had tried to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution so that the land proposed to be obtained by a specific candidate.
It was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that police chases a person for insider trading in connection with a tender and open competition." said the newspaper Pravo the head of the prosecution of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide further explanation because the investigation is ongoing.
Police have issued 24 hours after the contractor 46 years free.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
Asked by Pravo, the spokesman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace and, during the open competition.
"This was a customer and in no way an employee, she said.
The open competition according Cerna real name as "Call to propose fees for the transfer of land under the Act on the ground" and is established when several candidates appear beneficiaries of law.
"They propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to reposition that must be addressed prior to the announced land value."
"According to a ranking of the proposed fees is established buyers and Land Fund then transferred the land to the person who offered the highest fees," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear information about the people who registered for the call and as he himself is also a person who bought a Beneficiary as many rights to refunds, it had offered to candidates field does not enter the contest.
And he probably cashed in that to withdraw.
This would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. contacts were well above standards in FdT (Land Fund).
He appeared in the case of the former leader of FdT Vaclav Sankot who was criminally prosecuted for edit fields for which we had already published the decision to establish a construction.
Exactly Lubos G. had obtained such land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the artery should be constructed to access the industrial area Borsk Pole.
He later exchanged it with the city for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The mayor was forced to accept because otherwise it might put at risk by building a block of land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will from January to pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, and heating supplies in some areas also increase rents.
Families will have from January to take up their wallets a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity rose 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent higher in some places you will pay up to one tenth over the provision of water and in many places supplies central heating will be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be around for apartment dwellers the 100 crowns Annual power more than at present.
However all providers have lowered prices of electricity given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including solar cells.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people are most in need to heat and therefore the greater consumption.
We can also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are primarily the larger municipalities that are planning price increases.
Such as households or in Pardubice Hradec Kraloce pay starting in January for central heating nearly 50 crowns a month, families will pay more Liberec 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the city where rents increased infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a surcharge of 6.8 percent.
The prices in Prague will still among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest water and sanitation increased by 7.4 per cent.
The rents will increase substantially in such 450,000 apartments for rent from January ie at the end of regulation.
For example, the company that owns Byty ICC in Usti nad Labem nearly 2500 apartments, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new rent increase will be brought to court by the company.
Regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand flats could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and Fernet. Beer is more fashion and acts slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey were stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that lead most often those who get drunk, not yet fifteen years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recurrence are not the exception.
This results from the experience of physicians who encounter similar cases in children admissions departments of hospitals.
"The beer and wine are more fashion because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohol, "said Ludek for Pravo Pelikan, Head of Children's Hospital Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to steal a bottle candy in the cupboard, it is sometimes but it's the whiskey and vodka fernet prevailing '.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so do not feel it," says Head of Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, also gives it reason.
"In general, rum or fernet.
"Today is the alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools.
"In some cases it has acted slivovice they brought from home," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing children drunk aged thirteen to fourteen years for hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he served ten years in pediatrics precisely where ambulances were bringing large schoolchildren around completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times and
"She Ò his career at twelve years old when she was fed with 3.5 per thousand Inthe blood alcohol plus a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this case particularly important.
"She was at the Parc des Expositions Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting is that it did not appear strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours" said the Director of surprised.
Relief is just parents or their tolerance unusual deal with the fact that their offspring are involved in the drink are the main cause of alcoholism DEVELOP children.
According to experts, we do not yet speak of addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the word alcoholic means a chronic addiction to alcohol for several years with all related phenomena, but that is not found in children.
"For those who use the alcohol repeatedly, but rather a back-ground material adverse socio-familial," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Are integrated into bioindustry that cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization.
Children who are drunk after emergency care taken home by parents or police, are not counted.
Apart from the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan exsite seasonal three waves with which we can count: the day witches, the St. Sylvester and the end of the school year .
"Either they drink out of spite after poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the holiday starts.
"Of course I lived in the day witches admission of 7 children drunk at once," said Pelikan.
The child drunk who spent the night in hospital under medical supervision désintoxciation is paradoxically better off than one who went home and suffers the aftermath of the "hangover."
Headache in the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose is removed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off for it since they spend a great evening and a gentle wake up and nothing hurts them."
"They are just amazed at where they are," says Pelikan knowing that sometimes it ruins the mood of patients with at least the note to pay for their care.
The ambulance and hospital-bed intensive care may be up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education to these children by counting how much their drinking has cost and could spend all summer seasonal work to repay a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, he said, insurance companies in their management of health in decline, which should recover from the charges associated with parental care, do not treat cases of children being drunk.
L-159 Two aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft from five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the seat aircraft manufacturer EADS-Casa.
This is the first time that such devices are the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have however been abroad in the exercises or demonstration flights.
This two-seat versions of the L-159T1 which until now in service with the Czech army and were in flying condition.
Threemeals remaining aircraft are versions of the single-seat L-159.
They currently stationed in Aero Vodochody and intermediary business - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the aircraft Vodochody is currently unknown.
'The L-159 aircraft provided cars for the exchange were taken on airplanes stored for a long time without it because of taxes or additional investments for the Department of Defense. "
"The two-seat L-159 T1 have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be without two-seater because the department signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four single-seat L-159 two-seaters unused.
The army has taken delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being provided for delivery to the end of this year.
According Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of some Allied countries.
"In the contract it is clear that whoever takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS, and is dedicated to training pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter of who takes into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 aircraft for Casa and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense has not issued a tender and contacted EADS.
Management of Defence argued then that the exchange provides a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech military has bought 72 aircraft to Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, trying to sell the rest.
The aircraft purchase is likely to Casa legal implications.
The European Commission has yet filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the Court of Justice because the planes should have been selected through a tender at European level and in any case by contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the latter should arrive at Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have index longer than ring finger are at lower risk of developing cancer of the prostate.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study released Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger test is simple risk prostate cancer, particularly for men before 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger and could help determine which men should get tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, "said Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she attended with colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand men healthy.
More than half the study participants had the right index finger shorter than ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had longer index finger than ring the risk is, however, fell to 33 percent for men before age 60 the risk reduction was 87 percent.
The report cited two fingers length - formed during the prenatal period - including shows different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
A less testosterone is an index longer.
Previous research had shown that testosterone is precisely that supports the development of prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacle Paces, Czech renowned geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, for CTK said he is aware of this study but it does not seem, it appears that the relationship between the length fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated."

Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent Afghnistan a new weapon "intelligent," known only by the codename XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate barrel
Its missiles are guided by laser with a precision of several meters.
Special ammunition caliber 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive shattering, actually works like small grenades.
You can program the ammunition so that they explode on contact with the target, but also at any point along their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from on high and when it falls on a murderous rain of steel fragments, it can put out of action too.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it mainly so that he finds the target, sends a laser beam which determines the distance, gives a precise aim point, that he corrects his site and referred the trigger.
"Say you have referred to 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon is loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs offshore
The Fujitsu Group subsidiary relocates to Frankfurt Bad Homburg.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park at work who is currently in the office building of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the giant said Wednesday that specializes in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located far up on the city of Marienbad Bad Homburg will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyon Street Straße Quarter Niederrad Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman said that in the medium term, the group should have 100 more jobs will still scattered far in the region.
The lease offer was extremely attractive. Moreover, open-plan offices of Astro Park are more suitable way of working employees.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The CEO, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with a great infrastructure."
He says that the connection to the airport is just a great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday raised the joy of the winners and losers caused disappointment.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Dr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" and had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith on location."
Fujitsu fits the city and its implementation is a major boost for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision by Fujitsu.
Management has informed the city early this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help in this endeavor," said Korwisi.
However, friendly relations would have changed nothing of the difficulties facing the computer manufacturer owns the building at Place Marienbad.
Ultimately, the economic reasons were decisive.
It is now a place to avoid if exceptional remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lessor of the building is cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, previously used by Fujitsu and the "small vertical" nearby, and the remaining buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the draft construction of the controversial resort.
Result of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and City Hall. This provoked much criticism, not only because of the impressive development of surfaces that were once used in part to parking, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company rating and investment advice, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved in buildings.
In 2006, a German group specialized in Frankfurt Immobilien Chancen-occupied buildings bought by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group is headquartered in Tokyo, believes it is the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides an essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu has certainly many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, left to settle in Bad Homburg Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were leased in the building Astro Park.
This complex of twenty years old, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, among other houses the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics and electrical industry.
Expulsion from the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks feels more and more difficulties.
The ISP Amazon has removed from its servers the site specializes in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hiding sustained political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stayed in England.
United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with increasing strength.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now seeking a hosting provider in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom," said on Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists to the original revelations through the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the e-business, Amazon, had removed documents Wikileaks from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN, citing Mr. Lieberman's office, reported that Amazon has banned its use Wikileaks servers after an investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
"I wish that Amazon takes the measure earlier in relation to previous publications by Wikileaks information classified" said Senator.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lieberman has called on other countries to reject the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. In so doing, it puts our national security at risk and endangered the lives around the world," said a statement from independent senators.
"No company is aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of documents stolen."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent," Australian 39 year old lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard know exactly where he finds it.
Cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigue orchestrated by his detractors prosecution against him by Sweden.
The spokesman Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange particularly concerned for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacting to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the makers of the revelations made by Wikileaks is prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Head of Government Mr. Stephen Harper said on television, of course, ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama has called "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats and released recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I do not know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual owner of a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far more important than the affirmations of a website."
The U.S. government now spends on test completely protect its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center of the fight against terrorism, has been appointed head fight against leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House will also check the means by which the entire administration and protects information exchange.
In addition, the U.S. government announced it wanted to address the safety of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have made every effort to make contact with them," said the spokesman for the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
With the "Gelato University" Bologna is prepared confectioners ice best seasons of the year.
The introductory course of three days held for future glacier was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, which is to say in German confectioner ice somewhat old-fashioned cream factory according to the rules of Italian art of making ice.
The ice cream maker ice cream away from the refrigerated display case with a spatula, place it in the waffle and then starts to sell.
To find out, we need not go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone interested in learning more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice cream founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice cream out of its machines meet all the Italian high ideals.
The introductory course of three days held for future glacier was a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses on chocolate and ice extending over several days. Similarly, practice sessions are held in private ice cream.
In full midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply realize their longing on smooth ice.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries in all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education came from California is fond of Slow Food. He wants to propose in the future a European product quality in industrial countries of ice.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant company and she wants after a few years, make something of this singular art nerve-wracking.
Two young Egyptian dream to open an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of their ice cream bars, and the housekeeper came to Canada because his kids love the Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal characteristics of the ice perfect.
Is critical not only taste good but also the flexibility and silky smooth consistency.
However, do not forget Luciano during the training icing on the cake and the national superstructure, generally from the south: "The gelato is simply the best: and then it still retains quite a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pay the basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer heated at 85 degrees using an electronic program, then immediately cooled to four degrees.
He then opened a valve installed on the machine: it leaves a white cream base pasteurized foundation for all kinds of ice milk.
The trainer was immediately assailed question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we unleash the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against is the fact misled by the zeitgeist.
He who speaks only ice "made from natural ingredients," he may nonetheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, you just need to sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client does nothing but eat ice pellets.
Some modifications of the mass base are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Luciano master establishes the difference between the ingredients that we acquire in the produce section of supermarket or candy.
In addition, there are gunpowder and pasta.
"Suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in revenues fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice cream made from ground white base, adding the eggs becomes a yellow and cream is, when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all chocolate desserts possible.
Now, all participants must pass over the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites from time to time to produce four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the mass base, more or less vanilla flavor and other ingredients natural.
The different kinds of fruit ices are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, most of pureed fruit in terms of taste, it is absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a well balanced mix is ​​a taste of ice," said Luciano.
The ice-making is an exercise in calculation: if we use the peach puree with lots of sugar, it is necessary that the amount of sugar is reduced to the basic recipe.
An extra sugar is needed for the lemon ice.
Luciano has a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the Oechsle in the grape).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The ice-making no longer requires, as before, both physical intervention.
It is not only the manufacturing machine automatic mass base that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which it beats simultaneously mixing ice available to make it smooth and reduced to zero temperatures.
Despite all the automation, minor failures are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo is smeared mashed fruit from head to foot, and thus splashing his classmates when the gigantic blender control eludes him.
Luciano is the master of the opinion that "such incidents may occur during each course: it is a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to sources, the industry is experimenting with cultivation of GM crops has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the panel Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute to evaluate the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we well informed," he said Wednesday in Munich Dr. Christoph Then, Director Testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the panel Efsa for GM crops, Dr. Harry Kuiper, and other experts Efsa are under contract with the lobbying group ILSI.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to the development of test requirements for EFSA GM plants and is, therefore, clearly a conflict of interest, according to the criticism by M . Then.
The requirements are drawn verbatim, paragraphs, with the positions of the pressure group ILSI and thus bear the mark of the industry that, at bottom, is controlled by the authorities located in Parma, Italy.
It's already the second time Testbiotech denounces conflict of interest.
A senior official of the EFSA has recently joined unconditionally or without a transitional period the Swiss agribusiness group Syngenta. In doing so, she has changed sides.
There is little time, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk MDR) revealed the existence of personal relationships between the authority of the European Union responsible for monitoring and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicions of both the German Federal Agency for the environment than MEPs.
However, EFSA admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that we exploit all reliable data, including those of industry as they are of professional quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the EFSA to establish contacts with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, ILSI) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum, bringing together experts who owned, among others, on science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that GM crops are accepted without any feeding test animals and that we have not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified corn because the field" says Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the whole plant genetically modified, which does not yield reliable results.
"If we do not search the risks, how then can we discover them?" Then Mr. wonders on your accuser.
It is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientific researches since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic School in Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry increasingly tries to influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
Therefore, there is barely even researchers who are not related companies.
In the view of business critical studies were not published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls the security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell he obtained them, in total about 400 kg.
Monday afternoon, she stood outside the station in Stuttgart with his hit back.
There was protest.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators had come and began to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the proposed S21, processing from the central station in Stuttgart, an underground station which will cost billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the cessation of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) Crailsheim, a soft pad and coarse poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years residing in Ostfildern.
This has provided a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He says enthusiastically: "a small rock and cheap, simple and earth."
He claimed that the cutting with a saw, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He does not know yet what to do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Gsell Uli too.
traces of stone Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire with stones.
This 44 year old man trades in old stones.
He bought the stones from the demolition took place in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken or if they disappear in the landfill," said he in his office in a hut that was once a guard post.
He says he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the media reported he had purchased the remainder of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the project S21.
And he said he could not do anything to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of S21 subsequently won one of the parallelogram of stone weighing on average 80 pounds with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as memory in power while also hoping to make when rebuilding.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still crammed into the forest, the remainder being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscapers, Personal.
They came around and took away everything that could go into the trunk and trailers.
These stones scandal Stuttgart have turned long-standing "Mäuerle" or limitations on beds of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particularly" said Rongen.
"Had this been political component."
He goes into his jeep, toured its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law it abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before turning later to computers and to become a carrier.
And a lover of stones.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It is amassing treasures throughout Germany.
IT says it is the largest seller of ancient stone.
He restrains.
Stones carved with sand art are placed on the snow.
"Previously, they were part of the bridge Marienbrücke Dresden.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says he enthuses.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sand stone, previously part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the platform of Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Across the snow stones and stories, travertine Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, the red granite from the Cathedral Saint Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen think once the stones were carved by hand and moved using simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he became quite friendly.
"It would be a scandal if this heritage was put in play."
He did not become rich, much less wealthy.
But this carrier currently employs 14 people. In addition, masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener were installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but rewarding," says waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There too, there are stones to save.
Wrestling talent to win the high potential
The counter is strong crowd.
16 students are lining up to buy bread rolls with salmon, tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and automaker Volkswagen have invited students in design and mechanical engineering workshop.
As part of a sort of competition of ideas, they must talk shop about the cars of the future with the designers of VW, and by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go melee in the competition to find and engage the best brains, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the brightest graduates as much as possible in the lecture halls before they arrive on the job market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talent in practical projects and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig tinder the automotive group's talents.
A young lady service staff share pens, candy and cards bearing the logo of Volkswagen.
She talks about the timing of work placements and student jobs for young talent, she shows them the paths to get to the chamber group.
Nico is saddle the Technical University of Braunschweig, which is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can know the students, a closer look at the candidates seriously and appreciate those who are taken into account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle Such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive which seeks to attract students.
"Previously, the emphasis was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harsher.
In many areas, companies can no longer recruit their staff by sorting on a string of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially woo highly skilled workforce.
This is especially the graduates of engineering courses that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to forecasts by the VDI, the vacuum on the engineering positions will grow again.
Dykta novel goes hunting for talent on behalf of KPMG, the audit firm, accounting and consulting.
It organizes events aimed at recruiting expensive talent, such as race KPMG cruise-Race, a sort of rally-paper where contestants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight students and promising next year so that way they travel the United States.
Participants can visit the ancillary branches of KPMG and know the business.
Whoever decides to participate in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta the means used to search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the regatta."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
Talent scout for what Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until now we have kept in touch with all those who participated last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to graduate soon and want to send their requests to our company." says he.
Apart from direct tinder made on campus, small and medium-sized companies do so entirely conventional by participating in trade fairs where they engage in the hunt for brains.
"We try to reach graduates participating in trade shows."
"For example, in the lounge of solar technologies," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at SolarWorld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stuber knowledge of issues related to succession.
Currently, 35 positions are advertised on the website of the company.
"Right now, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and time consuming," says he?
Another way to make contact is through the university professors.
SolarWorld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The professors suggest that students have the opportunity to do internships or professional writing his final project in our study."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the solar experts.
That is why the company tries to do his advertising highlighting other qualities: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can not do that," says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
Long ago that the money no longer holds the lead in seeking employment.
The flexible working hours, child care or good promotional opportunities are other factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work, SolarWorld occupies 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual league table of German employers.
To this end, he asked employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions for employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company from job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely mostly external assessments in relation to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler German Academy of DEBA (Employer Branding Akademie Deutscher, DEBA) advises companies wishing to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, says Kriegler, this means first and foremost take domestic measures.
"The best way for an employer to make it attractive is through its own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the strategy of internal image, that is to say, creating the image of the employer in its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When treating employees well and they identify with the company, they are all alone advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if we were playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of south-eastern United States, over the years to come.
The Washington government has imposed a ban A ban equivalent and, thus, finally rescinded its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling far remained forbidden.
The Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
Is the explosion in April, the rig Deepwater Horizon "which is behind this strict prohibition. It must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident that claimed the lives of eleven employees and leads to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry had indicated that he was willing to authorize the construction of new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution and want to reduce dependence on the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil company, which faces claims of billions, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the outbreak of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil companies had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With control measures more stringent and more stringent safety precautions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms.
Meanwhile, Obama announced remove the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas groups.
The players in this industry are now publicly warned against the fact that the feed rate in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far.
"The government's goal is to curb the rapid growth of oil and gas" as the result of a survey conducted in the current by audit firm BDO before drilling ban imposed Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Alliance Enery deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulations."
Investments in new projects to support were deferred until further notice, at the expense of growth.
The country is dry Ogoni
Water flowing in rivers is oiled brown it smells like that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live for theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine AkpoBari has a good intention.
"Do not run out," joked the militant environmentalist journalists to calm them: "You still enough mud oil before the water lens."
Nigeria's 37 years has attempted to photograph a young driven into the muddy water up to his chest and drag fat that surrounds it: The scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water the color of Arc-en-ciel.
You can not see that the basement is full of brown crude oil slicks.
On the bank of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom says that once she was collecting shrimp by the bucket here.
But meanwhile the calm waters have dried up completely.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed from a pipeline exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the neighboring town of Bodo must now rowing for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoni country located in the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted in the world.
Full extent of devastation is obvious when one reads the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the boat engine splits cradingue brown water. Whoever puts his hand withdraws all covered with oil.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The palm leaves isolated sadly hang their flippers.
One looks in vain for the flocks of birds, as we usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence descends on the paradise of old who looks like a station service by smelling it.
"What happens here is war against the environment" says Celestine AkpoBari a sadly: "Our lives are characterized by a constant danger with regard to health."
The comparison is made wars.
The region inhabited by the Ogoni is a battleground besieged for decades: There are over 60 years, the first European explorers entered here, the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the writer Ken Saro- Wiwa. it was executed later. In 1993, Shell had to shut its manufacturing operations in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to Ogoniland is prohibited at this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5,000 boreholes and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines across the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the country's Ogoni oil fields are exploited, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred yards into the water rise of steel trestles as bizarre sculptures are very affectionately refers to "Christmas trees" heads boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, most are eaten away by corrosion to the mark.
AkpoBari believes that drilling head of this nature breaks occasionally into song, because a steady flow of crude oil poured into water.
According to expert estimates, over two billion gallons spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that flowed into the sea when the accident VLCC "Exxon Valdez 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the largest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to that question divides the actor.
For the Shell group, sabotage of pipelines and siphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part see the explosions of drill bits and punctured pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group in Nigeria to implement safety standards substantially less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "still much higher qu'alleures.
Some emerging forms of mangroves in a place which, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned shop, full of sludge and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and dirty up to his neck.
A fire flickers in one of many tons that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered with no pattern on the site must be identified: a small underground refinery.
Is heated crude oil into the barrel for several hours says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gas enters a container through the pipes, then at the end of the pipe falling drops of kerosene and diesel is finally obtained.
So Michael and his four employees daily produce four barrels of 300 liters of diesel, "It tells us 34 000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell for cheaper than that ridiculously low at just 40 euro cents per liter of Diesel: As they gain their raw material free.
it is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of pipelines in drills around the country Ogoni. Experts say the country is losing in this manner at least 16 million gallons of crude oil across the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant amount of the material is temporarily stored illegally Purified: The organized crime networks that are also among members of politicians and senior military officers, charged the lion's share of tankers and the selling off of the world market.
AkpoBari activist considers that the debate on the question of whether to attribute the environmental disaster, or rather subversive activities to the public or lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen were not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But in the meantime, the relations of Ogoni especially vis-à-vis Shell are so deteriorated that there was no question that the removal of the group. "Maybe that operators of other nationalities such as Chinese, will prove best."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It is high time you scattered 'Announces Robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can appear at any moment."
If refiners are caught illegally by special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be an arrest, but at most they will offer them bribes, kickbacks.
Even soldiers mainly from the north want to take advantage of all Nigerians as the raw material.
"At any point of view, this damn thing our country has dropped very low," laments Akpori.
Investigators discovered construction defects in the engines of the A380
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
In considering a device that made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the engine.
In early November, passengers on the Airbus company-owned Qantas had obviously had far more luck: During its investigation, the Australian authority responsible for aviation safety found that the reactors A380 had some serious security problem, and it warns against a possible construction defect.
This failure could potentially result in serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil line, says it in a position paper published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
Are concerned reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus company Quantas, who had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4, is among them.
The Australian airline has now started legal proceedings against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a lawsuit with a federal court whose Australian headquarters in Sydney. This gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The director of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts are detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the fire engine.
According to Rolls-Royce is the inflammation of oil that is causing damage.
After this incident, at least 40 units must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have said that more tests will be carried to safety on the superjumbo, which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr Martin Dolan.

On the national A7 Flensburg, staff of the winter service worked permanently, but they could not overcome the snow kept piling.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau responsible for shipping and hydrography (DSH) expects tidal Tide take place sue the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Piles of snow on the highways and federal roads have caused severe problems in Saxony.
Therefore the central warning of bad weather Meteomedia said the alert level was announced in purple Saxon Switzerland: in fact, is the highest level.
In places, there has fallen 30 centimeters of fresh snow and strong winds that have dispersed costs.
Several trucks and cars are trapped overnight.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced severe disruptions on the roads.

The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Nuremberg to Bayreuth was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30 year old woman died when her car was tumbling on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.

Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, the financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could fetch up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just embellish the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been upgraded in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of employment.
Now, obviously the financial group is seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is seeking a buyer for its two buildings, writes the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or sell them and put them again in future rental.
Thus the largest financial institution in Germany has already surrendered his seat shortly after.
Only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for $ 272 million Euro to holders of equity. She had subsequently rehabilitated.
Transformations aimed at optimizing energy engulfed, according to some indications, some 200 million euros.
A sale would bring obviously a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the journal, experts from the industry estimate the value of the towers, meanwhile renamed "green tours," about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently unclear whether the new buildings will be sold to a fund belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking for buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions at a mine.
We could not yet trace the body because the security situation in the stricken wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age is between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe was inserted into the damaged wells, but had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team could not descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second loud report, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance to survive.
So far the body could not be reassembled by.
Today, relatives and friends held a celebration to commemorate the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a blazing sun in Greymouth South Island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 miners buried, it was installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photographs and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, had also their places.
Flags were lowered to half mast at all public buildings in the country.
Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key has told participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand has nourished the hope that the miners go back to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie, whose son Drew Zen was buried in the pits said he can not resign himself to accept the death of his son until he saw his remains.
Besides the Prime Minister and relatives of victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemorative celebration.
Miners from South African and UK have also buried at the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have started to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The Commissioner of Police Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin to decline.
Go to hell, a warrior!
Splatter movie is it a movie light?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind with his film "Valhalla Rising," the epic battle.
To what audience the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn he may well have thought turning "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only eye is taken prisoner, he frees himself from his tormentor and, with almost supernatural strength, eliminates his enemies one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody, just because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When in a bad mood, he tears the bowels of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other side until the end of the film, the blind do not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters blurt, at most, at the turn of a sentence or two some horrible screams of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and feasting in the incredibly beautiful mountain scenery in Scotland which is the setting for the world of Vikings a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and the good shots.
When a movie has several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive.
Winding Refn director is considered, since the publication of "Pusher" trilogy on the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a sort of Danish Tarantinon Quentin, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the current dominant or introduce a little less brutality in cinema arthouse.
Most supporters of the art cinema must feel the horror of the brain that spreads all around and intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom when the blind sailed for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a violent group of Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem, they were drowned during a eternity by the calm and the mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Valhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and it exists only in DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling movie, from time to time, look behind and bloody pretentious.
It is no dialogue in this film, nor a coherent, everything is fun, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The viewer can not escape it.
Refn gives him barely a moment to relax and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and sound gloomy, but most elusive with a hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully alongside the blind, preserve a certain innocence, all others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any moment to fight enemies and allies temporarily turning into a warrior, may be sent from the devil himself .
He is the rotting, but maybe just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, whose purpose annoyance, excitement and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Energy Agency (IAEA) provides new insights into a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to comment on this subject, much less be subject to controls of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four fighter jets Israeli F-15 I attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building on Syrian soil.
It is situated on the banks of the Euphrates, the largest nearby town is 30 kilometers: Dair as-is on.
His name appears in documents of the IAEA, as it is about the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea parallelepiped in stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of current electric.
According to an intelligence briefing from the United States, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring town, al-Kibar, would be capable of producing plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry images satellites.
Through computer animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant which is a miniature copy of the model of the North Korean nuclear plant at Yongbyon.
In addition, she presented photographs showing the building near or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, it has little more information at the time, and even, over time the mystery deepens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but only had peu'indices developed countries showing that "an active program of nuclear weapons" .
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be more careful about it and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, and the IAEA.
Asked how he makes sure he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of the United Nations has given a terse response during the summer by claiming that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions. "
The Syrians certainly have hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a systematic flattening of the terrain.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen, discovered at al-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received by a Member State of satellite imagery from commercial providers showing the time that followed the attack directly. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired the exclusive.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that she never made a secret nuclear program and had not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected this argument based on analysis of particles in calling it unlikely.
Since that time, Damascus denies any discussion about this, as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to conduct a second inspection on the site of al-Kibar and refusing access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel maintains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official, Ehud Olmert, the Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comment on that."
Thus the investigation of this matter drags on since June 2008 without an outcome being reached and that it "becomes more and more serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as acknowledges a senior Western diplomat in service to the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA believes that to make progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities required to have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated what facilities it is here or what is their duty or they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf Iskandariayah and also the names of nearby cities.
The Independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) in Washington has identified these locations and found on satellite images a complex near Masyaf would very probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to it, which is exactly why Syria refuses access to sites of three IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians are concerned that the inspection group is in fact spies who were sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Indeed, this information provided by U.S. intelligence agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttles between the three sites and the parallelepiped stone to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one facility could "be used to produce the fuel."
It would "no indications of sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly due to the non-enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are at most plausible assumptions about fundamental questions: Where should have come and where the uranium would be separated by plutonium for the manufacture of the bomb.
It is not known whether the debris that could hide the traces of great value, were stored in three sites.
When hundreds of truckloads of earth are gone, nobody will have information about the storage place of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has done in 1998 examined the salt mine of al-Tibni, located a few miles from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, for see if he can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent satellite photos for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, a former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Of satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken excavation sites in the three suspects and moved huge containers, when the IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not helped allay suspicions.
As he said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out. This plan would allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, though Western diplomats in Vienna did not mention the destruction of the reactor, the emergency is not reported for this case, stating, for example, Glyn Davies, the Ambassador of the United States recalls in recent months, which is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means of which the International Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The IAEA chief, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to offer these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option that I am open to the future," but he still hesitates.
The plea is a huge risk: firstly, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries represented there did not want to see the situation escalate.
secondly, as the diplomat sobering: "At this he would, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
Things are going badly since Angelina Jolie has made her debut in the summer as director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We know nothing more about this story, but enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor states that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her tormentor Serb wartime Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's federations have protested immediately. In response, some filming sequences provided in Sarajevo have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in post-production phase, the protests are still ongoing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There was no romance in the concentration camps, and the scenario Jolie speaks volumes about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic was subsequently recommended to the UN High Commission to withdraw as a goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, after some hesitation has given permission to film in Sarajevo, but we do not know why not then come in spite of this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with his film, which is making great efforts it has made aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She contends that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and provide an opportunity for all parties involved to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
Thus a second synopsis of the movie circulating on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. It will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner."
Jolie's film began long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, and expressed Jolie, is "unjust and based on erroneous information."
Now, only the fanatics in Hollywood can give him peace: By illegally in this scenario the Net, like many others before.
We draw!
Tonight, all is well again in the Irish.
no sign of dismay.
Therefore the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are screaming for joy on the back of a strong music, they stomp their feet.
Baileyu-Pub Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because the players throw and manage to bring down the table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups on the opposing team.
This bizarre spectacle is called "beer pong." Winner gets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket to go watch him in January in Las Vegas world championship of beer pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual, this subtle drinking game and the computer aside, these two behaviors do not really go well together.
And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years trying to have fun, to turn away from the boring question, which will culminate in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans. In January he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The homeland is so far and I did not have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting in Auckland "in less than two, she landed her job as project manager desired event, perhaps a good sign," said the young man, smiling.
Because of the bleak prospects at home, two of the three Tanner sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin has accepted a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island like that of tan.
Experts from the Institute of Social and Economic Research indicates that 100,000 Irish people leave their countries soon.
They even provide a number of 200,000 emigrants in 2015.
This represents an enormous loss for a small country of 4.5 million.
If these predictions are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great ease, the grief is now taking all the space.
However, the economic crisis affects mainly young Irishman, well trained, who have known until now only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under thirty years old are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper published letters from readers plenty written by young immigrants, who complained: "In Ireland, all is adrift."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but one who has the capability, and our country goes and a generation."
"The last one to leave off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a future point darker because the government is just throwing dust in the eyes and offers no future for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades clung an unpaid internship to another.
It is said that his greatest concern is to migrate itself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
Yet men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon hosts the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on "working abroad."
"But the work abroad is for those new to the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first steps in the ranks of the occupational hierarchy," said the official.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a nightmare, but it also guarantees the freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Sean O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do in Ireland for the engineer of 29 years, he now works with 15 colleagues in the Irish construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just sort of ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hanover and Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan only rarely visit his native country because it participates in an additional workstation in order to complete repayment of the credit contracted to build his house at home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," says he crossed the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money by Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live any more."
He bursts into laughter embarrassed by crossing the cold.
The cottage is located in a residential area with gardens well cared for before, expensive cars of famous brands are parked on driveways.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with her sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and said: "I have no children to care for and I'm young, and even everything goes wrong, I can start afresh."
The engineer of the building do not often hear the lament that in recent times.
"Nobody should go hungry, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once lived here in the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad, this is not what the worst can happen, maybe that's what makes us feel first Irishman.
He laughed and then spoke of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after having spent seven years in Ireland, life went on, simply."
This idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his list, he already has a few years working in London. That's why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one thing that worries many in recent days to organize the festival on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
"But not a lot of emotions," he said, sipping a long sip of beer.
"Farewell, it still seems disturbing."
"Call it rather a farewell party, all relaxed, bringing a few friends with a few drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, like private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last poll taken Latinobarómetro in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased substantially in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy rose from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, thus lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region have expressed satisfaction with how democracy in their country working in practice and is the same number as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases, but up sharply compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If this held good during the global financial crisis is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have experienced a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security has helped protect the poor.
(The UN Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the number of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, resulting in a widespread perception of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession was more severe and where violent crimes have increased.
This is only the second time since the survey began more than respondents across the whole of Latin America have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the biggest problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or their loved one have suffered a crime during the past year, however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the most lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increased support for private enterprise and market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (cf. Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% support private enterprise), even if their leftist president, Hugo Chavez expropriated many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by USA (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela has the distinction of Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote stained
Nobody expected to have perfect elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the stricken country and immersed in fear.
It was submitted ballot boxes and a new poll, the ballots scattered in the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation
Polling stations opened late.
Many Hatien, including many who were displaced after the earthquake in January, wandering in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several suspected favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti the United Nations, considers the event as "an election fairly good in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "believed that these irregularities, serious as they are, were necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, President unpopular incumbent, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, is expected to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected second round is planned for January.
All hope is not lost the election.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
And so, obviously, Haitians do themselves.
Tiptoe toward the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, received a wave of public sympathy that has improved his approval ratings 20 points, more than 50%, it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernandez, visibly mourning, that it would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, the predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this connection, the signs are confusing.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Ms. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack Oct. 27.
Some dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied to Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a member has one hit in the face of his peers and where others have accused the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater flexibility to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage demands of unions, see the figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has been a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and served INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted the falsification of official inflation statistics.
Fernández Can now moderating these policies?
She called for discussions between private companies and union leaders.
And officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth after a sharp devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with bondholders who had refused earlier forced a restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid its debts in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández Seems To Be Towards an edging AGREEMENT WITH creditor gouvernements Grouped In The Paris Club, to Which it Owes Some $ 6.7 trillion.
The Kirchner has always insisted that this could involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which looks like a prelude to the Clean 'INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández will stay in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the Kirchnerist is advocated.
When the Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her has ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will decide to divorce or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
Half a cheer for China
Taiwanese voters are moving toward a kind of a closer union with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks his big brother on the opposite side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, or 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and councilmen in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has itself become a substitute for the feelings against the mainland, who established links innovative business, including a free trade pact in part, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949 .
Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five councils, he failed to win majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned toward full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT's 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Ma was in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, by vote of his party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in local councils.
The event unveiled the main topics of most Taiwanese elections, including trucks and noisy campaign flags of mass gathering that danced with girls wearing minimal.
A mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated mandatory.
Sean Link, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, has made a campaign tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly, it was not determined if the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, "said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election officer suspicion on the DPP and turning voters toward the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking how the issue of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, candidates joust with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan has usually its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid showing off its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese firms are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation as to whether its policy on China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
One can expect that the Beijing government continues to provide commercial facilities in accordance with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it would also see a political integration, but first things first.
Better to wait for it after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been jailed on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008 he was a troublemaker in favor of independence explicitly.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the DPP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans to a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their conversations can be held without preconditions.
Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party has an "alternative worthy of trust" with respect to the shotgun approach of Mr. Ma on China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that candidates of the PDP would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered that Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will be hard to choose between their candidates.
We need the KMT to make an introspection of itself.
Assessments of Mr Ma were weak despite a steep economic growth, the candidates of the KMT did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his firm and its local branches will be redeveloped.
The good results suggest that the DPP's support for Taiwan approximation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese are economic integration with China as inevitable.
Said Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has passed."
Grammy nominations: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and singer for 26 years hand-picked by President Obama to occur during his ceremony of the Nobel Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a appointment of major category of "Best New Artist."
Considering that Spalding is a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards in which an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society, marked a definite step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging, his skilful hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line to Spalding from the meteoric success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the Grammy Awards voters, taking into account the production of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters in the Grammy Awards have rightly honored "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "Instrumental Album," an invigorating thrill ride on a record that was a favorite primary last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B veteran saxophonist James Moody and" Positootly "keyboardist John Beasley will include competing.
Trombone Shorty favorite voice hoarse from New Orleans and frequent guest on "Treme" HBO was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which leans heavily towards a further merger with some of Stanley's albums Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, who is familiar with steampunk, has won some well deserved recognition in the large ensemble category, competing with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways "its byte's live was a fine example of Democratic hands this bass as a group leader.

The project of the Mosque of Temecula won the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics have attacked the project, claiming it was promoting terrorism both as traffic congestion.
But the commissioners decided Wednesday night that the new religious center in compliance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Nael Hadi, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 am and lasted until almost midnight and, mostly, people deciding for or against the center, the time for debate about equally divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is more American," wrote one commenter.
"This is another world of monkeys with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Islamic centers planned also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of about 135 families co-exist without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted more space and better than the warehouse it leased a property shared with a manufacturer system water filtration.
The new mosque 24.943 square foot Mediterranean-style architecture is composed of two minarets, and could rise to 43 feet high.
It occupies a site of 4.32 hectares on the road about two miles Nicolas east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against it to council.
Arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This body has twice the capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"Therefore it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign, "said Paul CW Davies of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report contained in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. the Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life is like, "says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations may be able to use other items to operate the biochemistry and that all" standard "elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed, "said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Research Institute planetary scientist and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It was not an accidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology at NASA, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so it was speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute one for another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty in distinguishing these elements separately."
But arsenic is different enough that it does not work exactly like phosphorus, it penetrates to the inside and, somehow, the work of our gum biochemical machine, "said Anbar.
The researchers collected bacteria known to GFAJ-1 and were exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic which she was able to adapt and grow.
The germ grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally or else on Earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it can walk.
Arsenic was more frequent in early life on Earth, "she said, so the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not only how life on Earth was formed early, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two show dogs stolen were found in Compton
The other two show dogs, four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles have anonce Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh corgis pembroke - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Sheriff's Department Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are good," Whitmore said.
"They are in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We do not want to say," he said Whitmore.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday provide.
They were reunited on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter located in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies have recovered the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a male 3 years, and Didi, a female 10 months - were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Rickard and the corgis that Peek had planned to show regional contests this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were likely to be extinct until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championship "AKC / Eukanuba" Long Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events planned in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," Peek said the Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the tour dog show almost a month the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, next to the window of their room.
They took three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a spaniel Brittany - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akita and the corgis, the thickest fur in the truck where it would be cooler.
They just opened the windows so that dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 am Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted for identification.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again restructuring the MGM is waiting for the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally given the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially praised Thursday the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that approximately $ 5 billion of debt would be erased, paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States, more remain no legal obstacle to get over to MGM afloat under the tutelage of founding Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become general managers of what will be a studio lightened.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 flights.
MGM really will not emerge from Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase has not entered into a credit facility of $ 500 million, planned to finance new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself runs to 75 million, and should be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to put its finances since it could not afford to pay interest amounting to 300 million per year.
In August, the CEO, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and meet more than 140 creditors of the studio took a lot longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009, put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders among whom none of them was willing to pay the $ 2 billion more whose creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, we had to redo everything when the team of MGM had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal debates and disagreements, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October .
When MGM released officially from bankruptcy within weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already obtained $ 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $ 9.5 million.
Businesses Cooper, who collected $ 375 000 per month for their services towards the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account restart production of MGM, which has released only one movie this year, and establish an annual list of seven or eight films that come out in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to conclude a separate loan between $ 265 000 000 and $ 275 million to fund its share of these two films, to be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, attempted a merger with the studio Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies failed to reach agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget balance
Although the primary candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game system from Microsoft, KINECTS, both can make a significant dent in your budget for gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $ 99 and a game KINECTS costs the same as 10 jump ropes classic pearls, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $ 80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to be stronger, while costing the same price if not a bit less compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys linked to websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin have more offerings.
Toys and button batteries are increasing, and toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for 3 years and over) are plush toys of the size of a guinea pig to sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second to compose a song.
If you buy several, they sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start pressing, you can not stop you.
To combine the song and dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $ 60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by technology Elmo Live last year, the 14-inch doll animatronic plays games in turn as Simon Says and can make the moon dance with its innovative hinged feet with locking wheels.
Children who have used the toy essyaé Mickey as an instructor of dance while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you'll remember Alphie, a leading educational toy computer.
He is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled quiz cards designed to convert a drive in a session with a self-correction of valves and a workbook.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three alternative self.
The Mobigo VTech ($ 60 for 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a QWERTY keyboard, though the games n'éduquent not as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($ 70, for ages 3 to 12 years), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a screen newer and brighter.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL Fisher-Price ($ 90 for 3 to 7 years) uses a type system for iTunes to offer games and electronic books and has an SD card slot for displaying pictures of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The objective is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, it's ideal for impromptu spelling bee.
Increasingly, the toys have some sort of online connection.
By not based on their presence in the toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $ 5 for 6 to 12) includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credit to the Club Penguin shop for two items to choose from.
This may include roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10 for 5 years and over) is the latest micro-robot cell button.
The false creature moves quickly over 12 pasta silicone vibrating in random directions.
It is fun to do a maze of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has survived a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary shift in our dog's mouth.
Bring a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin paced a city square as a sergeant in urban driving, inspecting his charges seriously nervous, emitting a low voice commands with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - responsible for imposing law and order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - convey a certain impression to all viewers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, "he said," what look like pretty girls! "
Four girls who barely past adolescence in white gloves, wearing jackets and trousers of the same olive color, froze at attention to you.
Four pairs of black shoes with heel, aligned to the rule.
Treated four hats perched perfectly on top of hair tied in a knot striped blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look mean," Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image inspectors urban China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a higher education qualification.
Guangdong Province has traded the gray-green-blue uniforms cons supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan in central China, has replaced the drop-the-eyes the hard way: In 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a snack trolley uncontrollably throwing black looks firmly for half an hour, until the peddler pack up his belongings and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to make a big image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its policy of urban street of 13 women, specially selected for their looks, their curvature and their young age.
The idea is to give the police sided one side softer, more feminine.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have problems attracting the eyes of the brigade's underground urban China
And for good reason, critics say.
Unlike the police, these agents are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the Hubei province have beaten to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them trying to disperse a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors to Beijing, stolen and posted online, outlines how to effectively overcome offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chengguan scored the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called "a real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district has placed an advertisement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district required of female candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years to have a beautiful figure and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must have a larger than average, at 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers said the work was too physically painful for women over 25 years.
"That's their image that is important," said a district officer in Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the surface qualities of the candidates determine whether they are right: it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Women's Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of district management of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height standard were the norm in many vacancies Chinese for both sexes.
Such is the case of exigency on the order of facial features.
What this means is a subject of great debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled and disfigured should not apply.
"We can not allow a person or a hunchback box used to come here," said Zheng.
"He would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol the square Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and cheeks dappled with a finely curved mouth.
It does not consider the enhancement of its appearance as sexist, "she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" Has she asked with a look jaded.
Xu Yang, dimples to his colleague aged 21, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not preclude that their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed on larger career ambitions than simply chase the vendors in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or bike, trying to sell as much as possible rolls and bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have said several times!" Said Ms. Xu, while a seller may have fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle cart noodles.
The agents describe their functions more as monotonous and daunting.
"That's pretty much the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female officers have no power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They can only threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden exposure to public animosity against the bureaucracy that are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after the spread of false rumors that officers had killed an chengguan seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang place where female officers on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as regulations require regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle cried foul.
A standoff followed 15 minutes before the police, face grim, to be pioneered to nudge toward their vehicle and are parties to speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, her white badge returned to conceal his name.
As the female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or older - are purely a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an image polished.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Li said Said-of-factly.
"Most of the time, the public is beginning."
Prosecutors n'inculperont not Senator Ensign
Attorneys Department of Justice have raised the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, derived from a case involving an assistant to a former campaign and its efforts to obtain a job lobbying for the husband of the woman are Wednesday anonce lawyers senator.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012 until the scandal over his affair not make headlines National last year and affect his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation of one year.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and did not intend to keep any charges against him in this case. "
The Department of Justice declined to comment on this.
The announcement came as a surprise to so many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there is significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a criminal prohibition on federal lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a job lucrative lobbying to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton has once served as treasurer during a campaign Ensign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case seems inconsistent with the ban so-called revolving door lobbying.
The evidence was made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of conspiracy to rape and material breach of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients in a government investigation.
Although Justice Department has declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers have ethics said the department seemed to be wary of political prosecution after a number of reverse cashed by its high level of public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of failing to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors were clearly afraid to take up arms, "said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This high-ranking Basically Says Government Official Cdn now assumes The Laws do not Apply to Them," she Added.
Paul Coggins, senior counsel for Mr. Ensign said in an interview Monday that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Justice Department and followed the next day, saying that the department did not seek no charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade the senator, as his office was reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, "had acted according to law."
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments he had made the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by the independent ethics group, arguing that the payment of $ 96,000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find work lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that 'he "hammered" the interior ministry on an issue.
Mr. Ensign has also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he has asked Secretary of Transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton committed to making lobbying.
When news of the affair came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and has resigned as leader of the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was not the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee would promptly follow the example of the Department of Justice and would closed its investigation.
Senator Ensign is delighted to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, "she said.
The call of Cheshire will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrific stories via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said there were over 140,000 posts on the trial of the rape case and the children tied to beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three family members Cheshire, Conn., should lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes has already adduce in court that outline the arguments for appeal, may occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense coverage of the trial - and the widespread use and extensive by journalists from Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation so widespread and instant details incendiary the jury was improperly influenced by the passions of the public.
Demand could push the appellate judges to debate the question of whether new technologies call for new rules in the courtroom.
"I have experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom violates the rights to a fair trial," he said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue State Superior Court, has tersely dismissed the claims in the ruling last week, saying the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been facilitated by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
Appellate courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a ruling that the 1966 landmark Supreme Court of the United States overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that an appellate court to review a half century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious, given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the media rooms of hearing, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting the instant communication from the courtroom would allow for fairer trial.
If Twitter is just one of many described by counsel for Mr. Hayes, which could be discussed for years, delaying the execution.
The defense lawyers also say, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have been prejudiced when the judge refused to Blue allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing grisly photos of crime scenes at jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and they argue that the judge wrongfully expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical to prosecutors and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual step of bringing the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, as the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly fanning the flames of emotion of the case.
"The stampede daily tweets of media cameras and reporters outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "were unlike anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally. "
Their emphasis on the coverage of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that the instant news were more incendiary news delivered more slowly, was a Luddite view that diminish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that courts of appeal étaitent often attracted by the arguments that the social and technological changes require adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insisted on this claim.
In their case, they make a reference to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 that overthrew the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they said they would invoke the need for new rules for new media .
"This case," they wrote, "is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can she reconcile the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on key issues to be addressed during the session of "lame duck."
But obviously, there are at least had a discussion about the differences polished of the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode in which each side wanted to score points. empty partisan point scoring.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the President's deficit was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcends the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare a new era of cooperation has come.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and testing one another to produce signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments of the participants revealed minimal demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapidly changing climate that existed during the last two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care or the rights, both sides remain miles apart.
However, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the side of the Ethics and Policy Center public.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, and then they s'estomptent.
That's good. "
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the session of "lame duck" Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, not least because the Republicans can not afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism hovering over a possible agreement on issues discussed during the session on the "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New Start."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "lame duck" will not lead necessarily to a better understanding between both parties when the 112th Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once things to be made will be, psychology in the short term will revert to one of confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism that the widely shared civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing over the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and present the voters with tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Committee of the deficit which include reforming the tax code and increase some taxes, to postpone the retirement age and reduce costs .
The co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, forced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the commission, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach this number.
The greatest strength remains among the elect group, which suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, little reason or desire to compromise.
Galston provides for two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year as partisan battles, since the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both parties will observe closely the public reaction.
Whoever is considered a loss will change course and find compromises.
But it would nevertheless optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid 1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological difference between Obama and Republican Congress that there was between then President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
Meanwhile, activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
Released U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and passed up some of the Kremlin bribery bribes and protection money that is collected, reported the U.S. Embassy United Russia in a memo in February.
The police and Federal Security Service are making huge racket that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also to organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share while the money flows up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday on its Web site Wikileaks.
The rating is based on sources whose names were redacted.
It was written when Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow was still Mayor, and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then there have been few signs of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a construction company to the forefront, always denied accusations of corruption over the years and he has won several libel actions on these charges.
In September, he stated that a Russian TV channel, when asked on a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's disposable, it is anything ."
The Russians believe, overwhelmingly, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report to the embassy, ​​and it is incredible to conceive that it would be diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the city government of Moscow and crime has led some to call him to "dysfunctional" and asserting that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy that a government, "the note of the Embassy .
"Criminal elements have a" krysha " (term used in the criminal underworld / mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Department of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as across the bureaucracy of the city government of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report states that the FSB breaststroke silver of the largest companies and the police are targeting small.
A source, he said, "explaining that the business owners in Moscow realized that it was better to secure the protection of the MVD and FSB (instead of organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means more power and criminal groups but they are also protected by law. "
"That's why the application for protection by criminal gangs is not as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money to be extended, protecting itself may be uneven, even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay close quickly find their business under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly raised the fight against corruption, but he admitted that little progress.
The note from the Embassy sends reports showing men who bring suitcases full of cash probably, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview with Georgy Satarov, director of think tank Indem "from Moscow.
"But it is part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without objection, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According Indem, costs would amount to corruption on the scale of Russia as a whole, over 300 billion dollars per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the rating the U.S. Embassy, ​​which was not made until yesterday, late at night, Moscow time, with certainty stir discontent within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is to solve the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the Wikileaks documents could be manufactured and has reacted angrily to the remarks of U.S. diplomats had disclosed the appellant Batman and bringing Medvedev Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that our interaction is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we never suspected that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit classroom with concrete walls crumbling of poor quality, the director of the School of Anlong Veng evoked the man who had built, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Kor Sreng Ma, aged 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization are still living today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, the loyalty of longtime finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation has allowed victims to publicly confront the people who participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual high school, which for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge's former child soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian tribunal, jointly run with the United Nations, gave its first award for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture center Tuol Sleng Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch."
Given this evolving situation, the increased anxiety among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts at reconciliation and wishes of their reintegration into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot United in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the final movements go down in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary headed the guerrillas from their base in the mountains in western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters have begun to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulation of "Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into abject poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia, and many are still nostalgic for the movement.
Although some officers elite Khmer Rouge retained their leadership positions in local exchange to have laid down their arms, it is unskilled farmers in low rank and file.
"These people have benefited very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are steeped in the ideology of utopian agrarian regime."
"They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept."
Lim Sor, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungles around Anlong Veng in 1998 before settling as poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok nourishes everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge tribunal being also caused worries here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The tribunal's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes but has not said if he continued beyond these four cases.
We need more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation have turned Im Chaem, aged 64, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of slave laborers were killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem home from work in the field near his house on wooden stilts, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the grass withered, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more lawsuits, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court had several suspects, although experts and historians challenged this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, "said Youk Chhang, the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation is in terms of Khmer reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center has produced the first textbook approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like most of Cambodia's youth Anlong Veng not know some details about the Khmer Rouge, despite links to the city plan.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said the new manual was helping students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they do not know exactly how many people the court continued."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, "said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, "he said.
However, the Khmer Rouge kept a powerful atrait here.
High in the mountains of Dang Rek, road, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, drove to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, who sells mobile roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated here.
"But he has a great spirit, and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and later that day, she planned to walk toward the final resting place of Pol Pot as it would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing good luck .
Belarus agrees to waive its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; Decison this is part of a surprise win by Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met by Foreign Minister of Belarus Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to give up the HEU and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were performed with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center of Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to remove the rest of the material of around 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the Summit of Nuclear Safety of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama, when Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the summit of the 2012 Nuclear safety Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant progress, important" made by Belarus.
Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has assisted six countries to get rid of all their HEU.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have been under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of Obama, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never abandon its uranium.
"We kept the highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the weapons-grade uranium and low enriched uranium," Mr Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our product ... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus has approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the equipment had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled over 1300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $ 13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low enriched uranium, unsuitable for weapons.
"Increased coordination and careful planning have been implemented to strengthen confidence" leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a senior Energy Department specializes in Threat Reduction World.
According to estimates by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies of James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have agreed that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations, and essential progress of the country and its citizens, "she said.
The government has raised no objections to the CIA flights
The government has raised no objections to the CIA flights with prisoners Taliban and Al Qaeda in Guantanamo direction through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El Pais, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Executive is informed in Spanish "pouvoir'démontrer they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which accused him of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, took place a meeting between former U.S. ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council's report surprised the Government of Zapatero offside "and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega said that Spain had no objection as regards the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so it can not "take by surprise," Aguirre tells in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, said the Spanish ambassador that the executive "wanted to give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges The Government had a limited ability to influence. "
In turn, in January of 2007, the Attorney Vicente González has submitted to the Embassy that it would not block the judge's initiative to seek the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain nothing incriminating, no sensitive information," said the Embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
The U.S. still showed their concern for "the apparent coordination between the judge and prosecutors Spanish German" for more information declassified CNI o Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between the Governments," laments Aguirre.
In March of 2007 during a lunch with the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Internal Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, it has commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely jealous of its independence and will do what 'they consider adequate, "he instructed his staff" to avoid comments that inflammatory rhetoric, trying to rebaisser temperature.
The ambassador also expressed his concern for the action of PP in this case.
"Despite its generally pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP certainly will take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero deliberately ignored or tolerated the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as potential violations human rights, even if these revelations, there were negative consequences for the United States Government, "she noted.
The parricide who went to confession complained network of "depression" to be a mother
The girl spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician"
Mónica Fernández Juanatey "Muki" in the network.
With this name she uses when she was small, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, the village of La Coruña where it originated.
The messages are for 2008.
To hear, one must know his love life, as ABC built with the help of testimony from his parents.
The girl Galician 30 years had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túnez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex was never allowed to do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The Chosen One was Alberto, a young man Lousame a neighboring municipality.
With him, she has lived for long periods.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, little remained with her partner, who was accompanied by even one week in Palma.
But depending on the content of communications, we mean that their romance broke, they broke up.
In March 2008 it is located in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I am coming to work."
"When I told him, that it seemed a good thing, but of course now he gives of what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants ."
And then she speaks a message from her mobile had just received: "I want you to come this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complained: "If this does not please him, he leaves the kid with my mother and I take when I go in," she alleged.
In May, she talks about the return to his village: "This week I'm going, but I will stay only until 19, because 20 I have to go to a workstation for not lose ."
She explained that if all went well, it took his elder with her.
"He stayed with the correct person, that is to say with me, and I will never let my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there was another post.
When the tape is assumed that the child, who had arrived at the island on one of this month, and had supposedly been murdered on 10, died.
"Caesar is a happy side, but there is not another."
"On one hand he is with me and he likes this place a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.

The People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With results from 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and MPs registered in the last autonomous elections, the PP has already targeted the Catalan general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more than positive, because the number of votes that formation obtained in these shows that it normally receives double in Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan won 610,473 votes in 2008 general, while the autonomic in 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, you want a diversion of votes of the CSP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the training analysts have calculated that, if there would be general elections, the CPP could be increased from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would also gain in four (he is now 10) and PSC would lose no more and no less than 9 members (he has 25).
These calculations would find that the place is fundamental to Catalan PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a member - he has three now - while ICV keep an MP or a win.
But if the election agenda continues, more next appointment would take place in May 2011 for the elections city, where unions may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, ​​a government that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both like the popular nationalist agree with the fact that CCS could lose the municipalities of Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists would get the majority nor the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV .
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not fancy that training will lose its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, ​​Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has registered only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves repeatedly.
The unions have also registered progress in other municipalities as important Badalona, ​​Castelldefels or Reus.
Now the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Besides the seven detainees in Barcelona, ​​in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian held by officers from the General Police Information Barcelona were a jihadist cell which led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, among which "The Liberation Tigers of Earth Tamil (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba (LeT), the latter being the author of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal gave great importance to these investigations as to ensure that, with "Operation Kampai" a "debility been" tampered with the device of Al Qaeda and international level "by Therefore, its operational capacity. "
The investigators calculate that the cell in two years during which she was active in Catalonia, has been sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that incorporated the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda for its " combatants "may go beyond Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell is dismantled only the jihadi network was operative in Europe, that is why in the investigation attended the share of services in Thailand, other European police units, so in the territory of European Union could be the days of shots similar to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (we held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Iftikhar Ahmad Malik, Muhammad Khan Begum Saddique, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Agunbiade Babatunde), Thailand was another place with the Pakistan captures Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who ran from Bangkok cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan Network - part of which was struck in 2009 - mostly tourists flying passports that met the conditions marked by the name "World Islamic Front."
That is to say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and with no visas stamped.
The investigators emphasize that until now we did not find any detail that connects inmates in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even if the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receiving stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless it must be remembered that a few days before that attack is committed, Catalonia has been sent through an agency transfers a few thousand dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the inclusion of "commando" which killed 106 people.
Police seized a large literature.
Mas PP asks to suspend the tax complicity
The leader in PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to explain personally to its terms Artur Mas support for his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, similar to those outlined during the campaign and which amount to give priority to the recovery of the economy and lack of philo-sovereignists adventures as economic complicity is that the nationalist leader want to talk to half of its mandate.
The president of the popular Catalan arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be loved, because the candidate requires that CiU at least one training exercise that the opposition should refrain from voting in the nomination.
In a possible agreement with the PP depend on future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress in general elections, but for now, the conversations that Mas has those days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan.
And as regards the President of the PP to support a nomination "should be removed all speeches separatists and independence," Economic and complicity - similar to the Basque Country - the leader wishes to converge even submit to a referendum.
The two leaders shared their bet to lose weight the political administration greatly exaggerated autonomic and elimination of tax on inheritances and donations.
Details of trading on the inauguration of the farmhouse will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and now he does it with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Geriatric says that the dead were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse has killed more than 11 seniors
Officials Geriatric Caritat Olot (Girona), offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage done to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilma, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly which was responsible in the meantime he worked there.
The Residence Director, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by counsel for the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "The desire would be that Caritat able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the dead but " legality and responsibility require us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials.
And apart from the discredited social entity can suffer for not having found time criminal activities of nurses at night, the greatest threat to the Caritat now takes the form of a large settlement that the legal representatives of relatives of victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilma admitted that the first date of the crime in August 2009 and that from that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge said in sentencing he was ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - care that he suspected many cases no doctor n'explorait deceased personally, but given the age and pathology patients, the formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday categorically denied this and said that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time because of what happened."
Counsel for The Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person that is accused."
The person already named as the "Angel of Death" admitted the day before yesterday and detailed 11 murders he committed the first crime 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed one second grandmother .
In this case he was killed by injecting a sober-dose insulin, in contrast to the first crime he had committed with a mix of pellets sedatives.
The director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control staff access to medicine center.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila does not lie in saying he has sought for its first victims death less cruel or otherwise it has burned within them as giving laundry has already admitted that he done with the three women he killed in the range 12 to 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, not the number of killings admitted they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that resulted in Vila his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the manner of killing after committing eight murders successfully.
That's why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of Trichet who warned yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The differential devices have closed at the strength and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ability of BCE to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a signal worried.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, he recovered, but motivated by fences of short positions and highly speculative.
Institutional investors take long to lose the fear.
A month ago, we quoted ECB today to withdraw liquidity measures and must withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank required to finalize the procurement plan of debt due to its inefficiency and eliminating all extraordinary measures of liquidity and eventually leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Irish hope after the crisis that extends measures of current liquidity "at least until March," and maintain the quarterly auction unlimited access to the end of the quarter to secure the liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the program to purchase obligations and that it even gives the signal to intensify.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will overthrow the excellent market response yesterday and they still blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said they did not even consider buying bonds they collapse and markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday's auction of bills a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million at 5.28% versus 4.81% at 750 million bid earlier.
Even so, the guys in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
Ireland was published figures of the hole and Allied Bank of Ireland.
The figures represent estimated 10,000 million and 15,000 short-term potential and they have a deadline until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are assumable in the Plan of Assistance and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government must obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not enough support, so Ireland is in a foster uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same partition.
The problem as Germany is willing to interpret Wagner and the rest of the hymn the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President took the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of action that the Council of Ministers approved on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive the use of sound to the gills investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect and ZP Trichet said that the Spanish stock market has suffered 4.5%, double the rest of European stock.
At difference of February, the reaction of the Government and Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we enjoy the surprise effect.
Today there is a listing of a key requirement to three years will be benefited by the effect Trichet, so we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance .
Spain to seek Assistance Plan is a self-immolation.
They give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40.000 million in available liquidity, triple from March to type very expensive and they cut off access to markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of the wife of Caesar, "to be part of the forthcoming."
Courage, we can get out!
The chairman of the board deny Eulen Vega Sicilia asked by his son
The storm did not cease in the open conflict in the family Alvarez, owners and El Eulen Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, challenge, because he believes "no law," the judicial council of the next El Enebro 16, requested by five of his seven son in which they try to assert their majority and seize management bodies of the company owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his son David and Jesús María José grant them legal battery for the new chapter in their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to companies do not seem willing to indulge in his dispute to be present in the bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of his seven son who were appointed directors in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year that the dispute is registered with the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 Madrid, opened the box again thunder in the Alvarez family.
Going to court to secure the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism to guarantee the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of his five plaintiffs son to try, through a processual quibble in the Act clearly defrauding and abusing the law , validate and correct assembly radically zero on Jan. 18, "according to its official spokesmen.
That argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting takes place, is challenged by considering that it is "void."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried, unsuccessfully, that the judge shall convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a company asset and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group service requests, however the usufruct of 51% stake, according to the protocols familiar.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of dispute for which there is a date not yet reported.
Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull have entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, selects its history in this world of speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first moment, nobody has taken into account the options for a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trend of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a pilot champion, German Sebastian Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers his car in the world of Formula 1 is talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the company multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the company launched on the German market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the highly competitive automobilistique.
Appointed PLM, this powerful computer tool was used to create assembly line manufacturing plant across the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce accurately simulate the product or process prior to building a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, airplanes Sukhoi or most famous vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, says that the use of this instrument in its computer plant in Formula 1 Red Bull helped create and run "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes, modifications and improvements identified during the races and tests.
Russwurm says the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who was able to introduce up to three or four vehicles on improvements each season.
In the team of Red Bull now working 180 young professionals of high qualification, equipped with powerful computer equipment and analyze any kind of plan changes on the cars.
The officer explained that Siemens PLM Software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is solely responsible for Renault.
We modify the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features.
Changes may take virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced manufacturing systems and laser autoclaves of high technology.
As the sole limitation of this madness of technology development there is the $ 40 million each Formula 1 team can spend each season as a limit to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has introduced the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a city 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially journalists, are restricted.
Anything that happens there is considered "top secret."
Personnel for this duty are 580 people here included two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1, without doubt, is the newest champion Sebastian Vetele.
Between the huge technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has offers to its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden players, whose business is invaluable and notoriety zero.
The director of technology from the factory, Steve Nevey says that five years ago one could argue that the progress of R & D in the case of racing cars brought the 50% wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology is the 85% success, while the drivers add on 15% of the value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are gladiators unpredictable."
HP will install in two years own 20 stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first store in Barcelona in collaboration with its exclusive partner Pont Reyes.
This is the first network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational is planning to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will recognize this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-centers as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the revamped store located on the Gran Via in Barcelona, ​​owned Pont Reyes, with whom it has been 30 years since she works.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 outlets brand in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opened were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of personal systems HM assured that philosophy for the location of stores is always the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises and oversees the design of exclusive furniture stores (with products that may be affected in an interactive manner), which in Europe will take an identical image.
In addition, HP includes the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the network claims to exclusive shops "to improve service to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, and even post-sale packaging ."
The store includes an area of ​​Barcelona with a pilot program to pioneer the global level that solves the potential problems of computer equipment from HP warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MEPs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet to 'steal' one million subscribers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola thinks that 2011 will be a year for the banking industry hard, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war debts.
Despite this, it provides a breakdown of interest margins, we will try to partially offset with increments of commissions and price of credit.
Sabadell wait three years to capture one million individual customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit it for the three future years and to survive well in very difficult economic environment.
The bank will start in 2011 a new master plan which will hold a lability of three years.
The objective, apart from survive without the need for government subsidies of Frob is to earn a rating of the market by capturing a million new retail customers - 700,000 if you can deduct those out of the bank- his great task, because so far this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies that the particular client.
This year he picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 private companies.
Its market quotations for individuals is 3.5%, while those companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basic plan 2011-2013 is betting on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the cost reduction goal, which will be explained the provocations by the bank when reporting results of exercise.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, because the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, this year will finalize its plan Optima has established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined to extend it for one more year.
Customers who leak the savings banks will be his main goal.
During a breakfast organized by FIPA, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year "difficult and transcendental."
The executive, in fact, think out of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted there.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalizes the margins - have reduced the price of risk premiums that banks pay for funds and its emissions to get liquidity moving already to the price of credit to offset the fall margins.
"The appearance of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We did not close the tap, but the differentials are higher," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase fees," but "there is a competitive framework.
The blueprint is based Sabadell on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that Spain "will be sought for larger sizes."
"Any move next year," assured there.
He claims that the needs of capital "greatly increase" and a Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market uptake of funds in the event of further capital injections.
After assuring that can survive Sabadell timing closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some are already predicting bank as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that we can not issue, but unlike what happened in June, one can obtain financing through short-term rest, thereby mitigating the crisis.
ECSC reject the possibility of a second wave of mergers among banks
The Director General of the ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and has re-emphasized the speed with which executes restructuring.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that have ensured that they did not participate in this first phase and they are reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most mergers have been completed, we can not say that the incorporation of the group Cajasol Banca Civic or a second phase, they are adjusting."
"Most were fully realized, it is possible that instead it goes from 17 to 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been made under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who worked hard in this operation as "said the officer.
In statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that it is realized in time that we set in the past, not now in the business plans with the Bank of Spain, "he emphatisé.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average volume of 28,500 million in assets with 75,500 to 17 million trial is unparalleled in history, by reducing the number of entities by 62% so they are much larger for conform to Basel, "said he.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions not very happy about the slow process of" demonstrating "a lack of serum and meaning" because "what the Bank of Spain is that we must remember meet the deadline before the end of the year. "
The Director General of the ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain's financial system has the most rigorous of all Europe and "probably" the world and attributed to people who are questioning a "lack of knowledge."
The officer stated that given the current economic climate, "we remain very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that began a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed. "
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has fared well in tests that stress ECB made in July.
Zapatero and German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it establishes the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions markets have caused a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for the SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or deletion of the 426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the airport management Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lottery.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as regards its responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be noted that the position of Chancellor is not a mistake in his political communication.
Instead, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And then Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which jars with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance movements in Germany are beginning to speculate on a possible three out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, built by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency area.
Second, the recovery of Mark, even though now it seems like science fiction, with a current of opinion very favorable, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a larger macro-economic control, fiscal discipline, fines on countries that violate them, possible suspension of payments for an extension of themselves and private sector potential cost adjustments.
The German position is clear and it's been a long time it is defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the Government of Germany has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of a discrepancy between what we thought as Germany had to do (adoption of austerity and fiscal stability of public finances) and that its European partners listed includes France, practiced.
The second shot of Central European countries was extended when Merkel difficult decision to save Greece.
From that time she has been a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus and public opinion in Germany and were published against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in late October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, demanding reform of the Treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time require private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, has been approved, and the months following, we should witness the process of reform of the Union which make possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line do not cross it.
And she told everyone, even if now we must take measures with which we may not be too Okay, from this date is the former functioning of the euro would eventually .
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case, the private sector will also support a party of costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances positive.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as that presided over the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And it absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turmoil to come leave us a greater peace.
And we know to take the opportunity we were given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and its dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting past Saturday with large firms and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite critics Merkel, it opened the way to the thesis that we must bring order to the house.
But the red line was drawn as Germany is there, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities being considered, we can not exclude that of abandoning a currency area crammed with too few countries seriously.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that we were warned.
Sport and fraud law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso Ramos and cons Ajax show ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
Expulsion hatched in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos) during the game November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has been much written on the anti-sportsman like behavior and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, few minutes before finishing the game (their team clearly already earned), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being leader of his group, both players will carry the penalty prescribed for the next match of the playoff against Auxerre and can spend without board at the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA has sanctioned two games with the team coach, Jose Mourinho and various economic players are involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not new, if rather common in the world of football.
She is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of unwritten rules, but followed the sport.
Part of the debate appeared in the reported cases are due to the fact that this has been a protagonist as the team entity of Real Madrid (which displays the anthem in its nobility and honor that in previous occasions condemned to a fines his players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who added another episode to his history of dilated technician histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behavior not explicitly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, if those shares are committing a fraud in law, for, indeed, they are friendly actions with the sporting regulations, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to sportsmanship.
A property that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is to say there was no game violent.
Another of those goods which it alludes to the correct play is to avoid the team players offenders benefiting unfairly from the team opposite, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not adapt to what is normally characterized as fraud cheating o the law, because its violation was not performed secretly trying to avoid punishment, but their action is precisely trying to be as clear as possible to receive the penalty by the referee.
They waited and they willingly accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the type of advantage that the offenders get them examined intentioned mistakes.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put in a disadvantage to rival and one obtains an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action involves letting them own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without boxes that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term benefit, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all at once and from that, with this action the players are doing a match penalty and spend the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than undergraduate.
So, climb the ladder, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to good sportsmanship, which is still part of the policy decisions that promote the maximum benefit from what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not operated to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud the law), if they chose m rather the moment in which they are subjected to it .
They made a strategic decision without penalty or thwart the escape that.
Even if the border between genius and fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, I think he is due to two factors: because there were two self-eviction and because of the way forward for the lead director.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offered to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar focuses this year a spate of bookings for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As nougat and the lottery, when December comes back as the group dinner before Christmas which continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, ​​but because of the crisis have lead you in an offensive price adjusted in order to capture the customer majority: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euro dinner or lunch, coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To complete the complicated accounting, the timing of this year (as night falls on New Year's Eve Friday) focused applications in the week of Dec. 13, with results so far as booking an avalanche of dinners for days peak (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, the beginning of time is difficult, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees hold by paying their own pockets.
No matter what the circumstances, they are all asking prices of battle, confirmed the president of Gremi Restauració Barcelona, ​​Gaietà Farris.
The representative of employers, now, do not dare to predict how will the holidays this month.
"People thought a lot before you book."
"They want to leave but they pay much attention to price," he says.
The case will go well "for those who provide quality, affordable, and with good service," he says, and points out that customers have the tendency to go down a level with the crisis, so that the portion around 25 euro became the majority in the request.
In a survey of various institutions in the center we see the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
Soteras group indicates a genuine boom in demand for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with complete packages of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even early in the November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same price last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, and a QuQu total of 23 local, remains optimistic after detecting a rise of billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources indicate that the group of 18 will also one day hyperactive at groups of friends celebrating the holidays ahead.
In their group of six menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more famous as the budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, like the Catalan wine made by the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees back and feel that the volume of groups has increased somewhat.
From the employers Fecasarm (which includes features such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment in Barcelona), Vice-President, Enric Gomà says the opportunity to begin to see the final supports of the tunnel and that overall Reservations are "moving" even if the clients' trading up. "
This is true, hope regarding the festivities did not go down, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad produce atomic weapons for "a faster rate than any other country that."
Filtrations of Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State U.S. filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms that causes tremendous concern in Washington Pakistan's nuclear program.
Aside from details offered enlightening and tasty on the content of the conversations and thoughts of diplomatic representatives accredited in North America in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increase, "decreases" and that the volatile Asian country producing nuclear weapons "at a pace faster than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are by emmagasinnées components make it difficult for their destruction in case of attack - is a major reason for worry in Washington.
Thus the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The near certain nuclear facilities in territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear material which is rumored and vulnerability of the transportation of materials Atomic.
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States but also Russia, and proliferating as a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities, given the lower educational levels and cultural extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs" said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Ministry of External during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new literature filtered through the gate by Julian Assange whenever cooperation is smaller between the U.S. and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of production of Pakistani nuclear armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, says that: "Transparency is often nonexistent, and the offers of assistance go unanswered or are eliminated.
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of National Intelligence for Southern Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world" .
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington for a visit to the Army Chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, not necessarily understand "very clearly" in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups. "
At the head of the hunt Wikileaks
Obama number to a senior official for anti-terrorism to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to monitor the movement and to locate Assange.
All aspects Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complex maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements of" Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise date of 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtration over a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, counsel Wikileaks creator, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
20, the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the order request to Sweden, but he did not make public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have received the indication to identify or locate Assange "for his provisional arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol can not give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red track record for free arrest - the national corps of the police must do - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed qu'Assange is.
The move has outraged lawyers to Assange, which yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, was willing to meet by video-conference questions from Swedish authorities.
They also remind qu'Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Pavlovich Beria Lavrentiy, security chief of Stalin.
"This seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world looks for - and Australia's mother defends her son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but it is not silent.
On Monday he gave an undetermined location as an interview with the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he demanded the resignation of Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to spy on American graduates they violate the UN in international treaties that the U.S. has signed, she should resign," he said .
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should concern us," said he to CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior official of the anti-terrorist Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of the Spokesman of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the opinions of politicians and conservative commentators claim those days.
Peter King, Congressman from January to chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House asked the Department of State that he is considering include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute any person who provides their contributions or assistance. "
Went even further Tom Flanagan, an advisor to President Stephen Harper, who had to retract his statements after saying qu'Assange should be "assassinated."
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the Government leaked information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," said he to Fox.
Puigcercos ERC seeks peace with winks to fans Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuation.
Huguet Executive proposes a more plural and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe for resolving the nth internal revolt within ERC, without due north of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for fans of the former leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted as the liar and that this can not possibly give headaches he had with other currents off.
That is why the leader of Esquerra try to win his critics with new winks that allow it to shield up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers ERC may decide on its continuation in secret.
By ballots, not by raising their hand.
If Carod want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they can do without any fear of reprisal.
In fact, the head of ranks to avoid the image of the division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said he does not consider himself ratified with half plus one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, a result "the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to the president Carod require a little more than make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that does not apply when the Control Puigcercos maxim body between conventions.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve the executive with a roadmap to the month of May.
For that, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation of the document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercos in exchange for the promise of it to schedule the conference for the fall of 2011, the leaders see as a sure.
ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects the stability and that its goal is to once and for all the organization is able to wash clothes in family room.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog symptomatic result.
Puigcercos considered the ideologue, the holder of Innovació thought that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various purposes" as if it had done.
And he listed five, which he said both.
The first "reconstruct" the executive to account for at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, include new figures from industry follower of Carod.
The second may be the character of big news.
Huguet ERC offers liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allow the achievement of the convention delegates elected through popular vote.
Finish with the model assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system was an obsession Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsing conclave of 2008 instructed the Executive to revise the model assembled in a conference specific reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished because the internal tide of recent years do not recommend discussing the subject.
Now, with no critical areas on the lookout, the timing may be good for the back and close it forever.

President Barack Obama met at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act Act to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.

His short message keeps open a connection with a cyber further document that asks the public to immediately contact the senators voting for the legislation is imminent.
"With a show that hopefully soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he noted.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote if any legislation extending the tax cuts of the Bush era and extend government funding.
Such blockage, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockage of the Act Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved we can set an agenda for the remaining projects.

The Democrats, the majority of whom supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against a Republican and only expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of many Republicans when other Democrats decided to vote against the initiative.
Among the Republicans most courted ago Maine Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and Senator George Lemieux out of Florida, who has completed the mandate knew Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act are spent Orrin Hatch of Utah, Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support another occasion.
Another Republican who has endorsed John McCain has not defined its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act is in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which participants showed off narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but ... finger on the wound? Is there hope for me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of Pleasures language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (for another fair round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, "she explained).
Finger on the wound ..." puts us in trouble," he told Argentine writer gently to the public, most young people who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen This table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio Shultz set after that as a great story, with Luisa in first person as protagonist who seeks to know what is the "wound," she goes from one doctor to another, without get an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of infectious disease she believes fate: "patience is not my forte, it is perhaps my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the trauma that has breath in the middle of the corridor, but explains that wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar. "
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "the wound I could only know that it is actually open and it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be highly interrelated.
Valenzuela, writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a delightful narrative he entitled Praise to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbers but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, was back people who had gone away or repaired virtues that lady had lost a narration as talk turns to America then The big news was that his own early chroniclers and cited in Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the excesses of the conquerors Capitans narratives.
"Cervantes invented all that we (writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but an aster way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacking even the decency ."
Nevertheless, said he, "fools and liars have better imaginations" and here reality converges with the lie, we do not know how much of the narrative belongs to a gang or another, where the literature fiction peaked.
This is called de facto 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"Thanks to his legacy as one is what one tale."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the IDF with its round table is on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican puts hers on the great plague of social violence that his country is going through - and the Latin America division - produces the hassles of traffic and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry good songs contain an implied undertaking that course is not premeditated," said she, after mention the reality of literature is communication and the size of engagement established between the author and readers, and it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero also stressed that "this is the scourge of committed writer.
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with concern the intellectual habits and control of conscience which turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every statement there is a little behind and not every denial there is a small yes. "
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be masters of reality, we have qualified: qualified and means a lot of time put your finger on the wound and disturb the people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, and white black, established ideas and unqualified and too disturbing to the powers that prefer a world in black and white, "he said, calling to recover the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has achieved three times the series crucial.
With the dual Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there is also two different styles that come into conflict, marked by their technicians, who find them a marked contrast with the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he has achieved three times the series crucial, although so far it has not hit the mark and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine finally console themselves with the medal as champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The strategist Santista reached his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia, with whom he has lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca later in the end 2003 there have also been decisive in the battle and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
Santos Laguna with already, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Ruben suffered a setback again, because his team has a match equal to 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he earned a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed from 11 yards and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Ruben has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and Monterrey with his rival in the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he tries to break away from the spell in order to celebrate first title, even if He says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers many of the last final, which maintains that it learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because last time with two penalties to take we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson before the end of the match we can not celebrate ."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which did not trouble him because he trusts in his players: "It never tries to reach the round of penalty kicks, we try to finish within the time scheduled, but sometimes it only remains that we prepare, the tournament earlier we were prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes the emotions or anxiety to keep the title in our hands, hands it has eluded us, it we served as a lesson for the final and hopefully we can no longer in that situation. "
Romano is an opportunity not to be an experienced sub-champion and the first taste of glory offered by the titles.

The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer need to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the courier delivers the document.
The aspirant will realize a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, $ 150 in the case of visa-application (here includes visas for temporary workers) and $ 390 for visa traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the consular representative, they arise only at the ASC nearest where they will present documents and they will take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be made in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay less time.
Similarly, applicants for visas in the Consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer pay the extra service costs $ 26.

NASA announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press tomorrow to present a discovery that will impact on the search for living beings in space.
The Administration National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will provide U.S. tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiological a discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 am at NASA Headquarters in Washington to experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe .
When she quoted the press, NASA has assured that it would present that will have impact on the search for extraterrestrial life, "which has sparked speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures similar to us in ambient and hostile than previously thought and would uninhabited on the table the opportunity to become intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions have improved.
It seems there is talk of a microbe found in the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, who lives in an ambient which was thought too poisonous for any life form, because the lake is rich by arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and capacity makes us think that life could exist like on other planets not volunteer our atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organizations use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another life form, a second form of life different to what we know."
The space agency will provide the true scope of discovery in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
To attend the conference Geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that Earth.
Germ PRD, PT and Convergencia Patrón 'block the opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it is possible the arrival of 'bipartisanship', do we denounce.

With this reform, reiterated Does it initiates the 'bipartisan' because now there are two people, the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four members, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directorate headed by PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo noted that with these reforms are institutionally is the political marginalization from PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern by starting with a political will and if they did not, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way eventually the opposition coalition.
"Until now arrived (the opposition coalition), which is what I look, because we are excluded from any decision, they did not even consider the deferential political opinion of the rest."
Manzanarez Felipe Rodriguez, said that with Convergencia PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and therefore they form a plural group.
We can not allow a poursuivit'il that Congress, having been a monopoly, is now "duopoly."
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress."
For starters, this group began with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to be more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT, explained that this Congress has turned into a 'spoils' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member and give him his place at the negotiating table.
"That they do not leave by agreements outside cupular to 5 which will probably be 9 members, now we see that the five, separated into different fractions, we decided to unite to seek a place in the table , that is the problem that the reform they did, they decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform. "

Attractions should be treated
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the occurrence of foreign tourists because of poor conditions at the roundabout Sanchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, tourism Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Merchants Association of Zona Dorada, said they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination is neat and new activities and should replace other tourists that are bad.
He said the poor condition of streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk and they see the mess and avoid the shops nearby.
"Politicians know that means closing a business one day and they do not know that wealth is lost, besides they did not work for so long and without adequate planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Sánchez Manguart said that the fall of tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality should assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do so through preventive maintenance and not just make the fix," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the fact that this is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as people who deserve a clean place to live and the City must change its strategy for many maintain the city. "
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, like Escudo and Venadito Mazatlan.
"Today, because tourists come, it does not depend only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the cleanliness of its beaches, boulevards, ongoing maintenance of tourist attractions," he said it.
"They were not paid the attention it needs and what type of facts said something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Martínez Llera, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist attractions in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a variety of places that should get in line together with the municipality and be a priority for the city to date, clean, orderly, and it is attractive because it has a tourist value.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many sites and historic places and cultivation that should order first, clean up and put us in line to make them attractive to be able to add to the inventory that we have to promote these destinations" .
IP calls for results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CEC, proposed that members assume a great responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations confronts.
The business area of ​​Mazatlan Legislature seeks to work with dignity and free of agreements between the parties and the executive government, as Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60-th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, PAN 13, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one PT, one of Convergencia PVEM and one in total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new Congress government integrants is a management and engaged with society and different sectors that need a legislative responsibilities and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CEC, proposed that members assume a great responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations confronts.
"We hope that members are actually exercising their right of free agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they are transformed into masquerade carnival of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions" .
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that are advancing the current Government.
"We will make sure they do a decent job and especially engaged with society and sectors of Sinaloa as people have given their vote of confidence in elections past.
José Ramón Sánchez Manguart, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered a major provocation of 40 popular representatives is to grow and add forces seeking the state's economic growth, because now the situation economy is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push the economic growth they generate perverse incentives for investment and infrastructure and in a manner that will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to strengthen the Secretariat of Tourism Governmental.
"I realized that this is the second Secretary of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with agro-industry."
Aside from the fact that we must classify the resources to tourism projects detonators that helps give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous parliaments have not been resolved.

14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in the Eastern Townships on Wednesday in connection with the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were allegedly used to drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Surete du Quebec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including two alleged masterminds of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a lengthy investigation, which lasted close to a year.
"It is information received from the public who helped us make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
About 70 policemen from the regional investigation unit of the Eastern Townships of the Sûreté du Québec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the police board Memphremagog, took part in the police operation.
Illegal migration will continue without problem
Bill conservatives who, according to the government, should solve the problem of boatloads of illegal immigrants, will obviously be lost while the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support .
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by deputies after holding the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to one year from anyone identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it attacks the wrong target.
"We are cons and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we'll see what the government will," said Duceppe.
The NDP critic for immigration, Olivia Chow, was rejected out of hand the criticism that his party is not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree that we take action against smugglers and that's what we do through another bill, Bill C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill because the Conservatives attacked the refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Chow.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly members say they do not tolerate this kind of smuggling, these criminal operations which target Canada and treat China as a doormat."
"They expect that Canada should take firm action," responded the minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on his bill, which could lead the country to elections in the event of rejection.
A conservative but said the Agency QMI that the government would seek a vote for each member who opposed then explained to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit for fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York about this last January.
The city has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement has surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec, on October 29 last, this was never discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not take long for the PQ critic for public safety, Stephane Bergeron, described the announcement as "rabbit out of a hat" and "DIY solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil has meanwhile responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce it, just there to say."
"We're aware of that problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me it has something to hide," he says.
"The only way to have a commission of investigation, the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert meanwhile, professor of ethics and governance at the Ecole nationale d'administration publique.
To overcome this impasse, he suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the Auditor-General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he slice.
He also believes that Quebec could provide the auditor with the same powers as a commissioner, allowing it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the pipeline of the Charest government.
Quebec would also call on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request from the prosecutor of Operation Hammer, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has meanwhile confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson is currently working on amendments related to this issue.
In Operation Springtime 2001, which struck the biker gangs, even though the Criminal Code was inadequate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa has since passed the Act offenses.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under close surveillance because of heavy rains that have battered many parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two homes were evacuated as a preventive.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell on several areas, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
20 to 40 millimeters more rain was expected by Thursday evening, according to regions.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As it is necessary to add that rainfall and melting snow have accumulated in some sectors, there are fears the overflow of several rivers.
Warnings of flood warning was issued Wednesday by Quebec's civil security for rivers Ouareau and Bass, in Lanaudière.
Northern Rivers, Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentians, and Oak, in Lotbinière, they were on the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused flooding of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare Rawdon as well.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away due to heavy rains.
Ten homes were evacuated as a precaution.
In Ottawa, the overflow of lakes has led to the closure of several roads, including the Municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on high alert and monitor the situation closely, "said Annik Bouchard Security Advisor.
The Flood Forecasting Centre of Quebec, for its part issued warnings Wednesday of floods for several large rivers, including Muskie, L'Assomption, Ouareau, bass, Batiscan and Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
The radio host in Quebec City Stephane Dupont suffered a setback part to the Canadian Council of Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about welfare and the Haitians as well as his foul language on air.
The CBSC finds that Mr. Smith and his team CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative portrayals of Haitians and coarse language that is unsuitable for programs broadcast during the day. "
The Council also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the codes of broadcasting.
The CBSC received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of welfare recipients in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Facilitators must have solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, the animator Stephane Dupont had considered suicide as an act of coward.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question in" Dupont lunch "touched a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate."
No blame has been withheld at his place.
The last case involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a face-to-face media which had aroused many reactions.
The facilitator CHOI said he had not donated to help the Haitians because they could not know with certainty that the really needy people receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative portrayals of Haitians.
"I've served my three-day suspension on it."
"My record is blank for a year and a half," said the leader.
In all decisions, the Committee denounced the spread of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among others, announce those decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmali has a very special journey.
The athlete who excels in "Sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing up on the tatami and the rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, said Zemmali installed in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground game now in mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, one who works as a security officer and a clerk for the company UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said. "
"Currently I am preparing to go to China for the FIFA World san shou."
"Combatants who finished among the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, China, I concluded the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I rose at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sand" is a discipline originated in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground are allowed.
Duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmali has to remember only one event in his career, he certainly meets its presence in the super tournament, "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the toughest and most prestigious in China, said the friendly guy."
"That's really the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmali won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"Those who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinal clash in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category are opposite to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without bids
Hydro-Quebec has granted OTC $ 450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Axor who got the most important one of the managers of the project for $ 295 million without tender.
The consortium called Energy management was established in 2004 concurrently with the choice of Hydro-Quebec to entrust the private sector's responsibility to manage this important power project of 5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium clinched the lucrative contract without there having been a public tender.
For the Parti Quebecois, the use of consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem that may eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way of collusion and shoot competition."
"That is to say that people, instead of doing it in secret, are now openly," he said yesterday PQ member Sylvain Simard press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard has raised the question in the National Assembly because he says hardly see how the public interest can be served this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion on the contract.
"I'm getting my trip," she moaned, holding that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "been lax."
She said "it would be the least of it" regrets that the PQ.
Form consortia is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies combine their respective expertise to answer a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain has a high level of complexity given the scope of work.
The project is under way and should continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition act, there was trading.
Also, the formula is no longer a consortia except in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is the subject of an investigation into government.
A quick overview of the business register of Quebec can count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA +, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Tecsult Roche and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens, reduce to a single legal entity or Dessau.
Regarding Energy Consortium managers, the Minister Normandeau said that "the territory of James Bay responds to the dynamics of labor and special Hydro-Quebec responds in a particular way since the '70s."
The big boss of the Eastmain, Réal Laporte, Power Corporation of James Bay (SEBJ) gave an explanation that has raised eyebrows about the fact that the management contract for the project was granted by agreement.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your cost will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in that market and you say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that matters is the competence of the people," said Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium Energy management is part of a long list of contracts over $ 50 000 obtained by the Parti Quebecois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir has 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 for firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, besides its participation in energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They totaled $ 449 783 344, including contract management of Energy $ 295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that comprise the consortium (OPI, Dessau, Axor Group SM) "are well known to the Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau dropped the PQ is also related to those companies that "fund," before explaining that it was more of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible drinking - The label "green" does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers is very little trust in actors in sustainable development, but also fair trade brands and certifications greening to guide their choices.
Worse, even if it is immersed in a world where media messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, there is a lack of credible information, he described the same lack of commitment to brake, said the Barometer responsible consumption, the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers seem, however, give very little credit for those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say not to believe in fact the environmental commitment of companies like green advertising companies, shows the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications attached to products called fair, but also the credibility of brands and products displayed as eco-friendly, says the barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
The information on responsible drinking seems to stimulate this vital piece of the consumer being led by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable information would calm the ardor of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Furthermore, one third of Quebecers say they are also wary of alleged performance of green products or services sought to put their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 have changed their habits and especially switched brands of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also encouraged purchases from merchants in their neighborhoods and favored the purchase of food grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached a maximum 64 out of 100 this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by Concern Animal Welfare.
But its social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside of his car, according to the Barometer in 2010, only 28% of Quebeckers said they used public transit or carpooling are encouraged to defend their interests green.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral investigation, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan to repurchase eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who were asked to make a financial commitment in buying the cinema complex by the Company eXcentris Angus and Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but up to a loan only.
Angus Development Corporation and Parallel, hoping a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois eXcentris cinema complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent by restoring its full cinematic vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the issue, but on its own terms.
Rather than giving expected, the Quebec government is proposing a loan whose amount is also lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on favorable terms, at least in the opinion of sources in the pharmacies of the state.
An initial action plan and a demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have since been revised downward.
A proposal and action plan have been sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for cultural enterprise development (SODEC), François Macerola, which lead on eccentrics.
He sent a final report there are about ten days.
But the proposal of the cabinet-cons came to SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until Dec. 31 to respond.
It seems that the assumption of giving the state should really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association of Theatre Owners and drive-ins of Quebec opposed to a direct government investment to support the purchase of eccentrics, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not fund building projects, he has not done for other theaters.
But a number of stakeholders demanding instead a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the house for ten years has increased to overreach the auteur cinema complex in its premises after having financed his own construction, which could justify a departure from the Treasury Board.
The lack of venues for independent films is crying out to Montreal and had known eXcentris customer loyalty.
Angus Society and Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, steer their side, a fundraiser to private, hoping to collect $ 700 000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of three screens, the parallel, continuing to show movies in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27 by projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois men and gods.
But Christian did not recall Yaccarini Le Devoir and it is unclear what he and his group believe the proposals down to them doing.
The veil lifted on Canadian complexed ...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers as the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they betray the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats were surprised that each Canadian voter has not the Canada-US relations in mind by voting and believe that Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington unfolded in the public yesterday, providing more juicy details as the substantive content to be put in the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in full federal election recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"A Canadian inferiority complex almost inherent conditions may be Canada's political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than to focus this election on the U.S. (as in the campaign on free trade from 1988), "he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk."
The ambassador has even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have strong political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, party and even more of a party leader to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going vote. "
Another expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the cable sent January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa, President Barack Obama prepares for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will record its first deficit in over a decade due to a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars, "writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is there mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and the opposition parties made conditional upon its survival quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins warned Washington of the image more negatively than drama series broadcast on CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about emissions Border Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is some subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List," or abduction for tough interrogation of CIA.
Another cable recounts that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners at Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "individual case."
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the matter."
Finally, note that tempers flare on the site Wikileaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former close adviser to Stephen Harper said on CBC that is responsible for this mass exodus should be "assassinated."
He was echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The UN has proposed a plan yesterday to Cancun renovation of domestic lighting, Commercial & Industrial in 100 countries for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) which is almost a third of the additional reduction that it must be realized to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the great achievements that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments for reductions by industrialized countries.
Under the plan filed yesterday, if incandescent bulbs that consume another 50 to 70% of the market were replaced with compact fluorescent bulbs, or better, by light emitting diode (LED or LED in English), most of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emissions on the planet to enlighten humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of global emissions of cars.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should increase overall emissions GHG from 53 Gt to 49 Gt
But it will subtract from this review to get another 5 Gt by 2020 to stabilize the climate up to 2 degrees centigrade to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5%, produces light.
With CFLs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs will reduce the need for energy twice more.
CFLs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week the manufacturer Philips - the company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of ​​possible savings with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with dimmer switches in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several scholars have shown reservations about the place of CFLs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers are established guidelines.
But the report said, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the CFL, but the coal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent .
In the U.S. alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would do with this international program.
For example, Indonesia and would save one billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 power plants whose construction would cost $ 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits nervousness announcement of election results
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the release "without delay" the results of presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The secretary general stressed the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN chief. "
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to act responsibly and refrain from taking action until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the Wednesday midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had said on television that the Committee "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied around the world Wednesday to finally announce that the CIS the winner of the runoff between the incumbent and the opponent Laurent Gbagbo, Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo's camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council to vote "fraud" in the north, held by the former rebel New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that voter intimidation practiced by the FN in the north had deterred supporters of outgoing President to vote.
Entire election could be canceled if the complaints Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Yet Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links with the former rebels, said it was "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but he stopped short of claiming victory .
His allies say that Gbagbo blocked publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the Election Commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday that the Ivorian political class could be held liable for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had topped the first round, Oct. 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% Alassane Ouattara, who has received public support of former President Henri Konan Bedie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in Q3
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in France (9.7% by counting the overseas departments), the data show seasonally adjusted (CVS) temporary released Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed stood at 2.631 million in France.
Data from the second quarter was confirmed at 9.3% of the workforce in France and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate appears up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in France do not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available within two weeks to work and they are looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people present on the labor market deteriorated further, with a further rise in unemployment rate increased to 24.2% in France (+ 0.9 point in three months, 0.5 point on a year) and 25% including DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed on the ILO.
Older people have known their share of unemployment increased slightly to 6.4% in France (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over one year) or 482 000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49 years received a stable unemployment in the third quarter to 8.3% in France (-0.1 percentage points over three months, 0.1 percentage points year on year) and 8.8% in throughout France.
INSEE no longer publishes monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so, however, and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October from 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerin indicted and detained
Alexandre Guerin, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS General Council of Bouches-du-Rhone, has been indicted and jailed in the prison of Luynes, near Aix- en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged procurement fraud.
Alexandre Guerin was indicted for misuse of company property, and embezzlement of public property, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, said his lawyer.
Alexandre Guerin is combative and would like to explain any questions the judge will ask him, not fantasies. "
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of heads reprehensible, it is another thing to prove," told AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guerin, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noel Guerini, held through its lawyers, to put before the judge hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and jailed Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run landfills that had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or destination of funds related to their functioning, he never knew, "said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the city of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision and forbidden to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client was able to explain the facts alleged against him."
"The magistrate took into account not only depriving him of liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yannick Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday with judicial supervision for two of them, said Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Karabadjakian Michel, assistant director general cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is accused of "influence peddling and corruption."
Two officials of the town of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christopher Bringuier, are indicted for a "subtraction and embezzlement of public property by a person charged with a public service mission," another for "complicity misappropriation of public funds ."
Finally, the companion of Alexander Guerin, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "concealing the abuse of corporate assets."
Among those who have faced Mr. Stéphane Guerin Figure Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case involving procurement fraud in Corsica.
Investigators suspect the companies have used to launder money from crime.
The survey is part of several judicial investigations against persons unknown in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters to suspected fraud in the procurement, especially in the waste stream.
A source close to the investigation, the investigation focused particularly on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Reiss: The Elysee has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For over ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for spying, held in suspense opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents obtained by Wikileaks and consulted by Le Monde reveals hidden side of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained his strategy to the Americans, up to provide advice for dealing with their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the French girl had not been offset by the release of Kakavand Majid, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the U.S. court for smuggling materials for the benefit Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a harsh light on how the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Reiss.
In reality it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostages."
Counsel for the Elysee for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interview with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They tell him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Make some noise," they say, "hammer ever" in the media the words "fundamental rights," "Innocence," "immediate release."
It must be embarrassing to the Iranian regime is sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
Because past attempts at discussions with discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "masters of delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a tactic familiar to Iran: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release from prison of Reiss (who will speak on Aug. 16, when she took refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money (230,000 euro deposit).
And he indicated that the Elysium anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop a few other 1800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Reiss was released from prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is released by Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the U.S. demand for extradition of illegal traffic sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, was released in Paris, ordered by a judge.
The U.S. embassy, ​​as many observers wondered about the troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the clandestine networks of Iranian acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, expanding Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has she accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian cons than the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he said, not only has "taken completely by surprise by the decision of the judge," but sought to oppose.
"There were sharp exchanges between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not reverse the decision" judicial, "he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remain under the "closely" monitoring the French intelligence services.
Counsel for the Elysee dials a phone number, hangs up, then informed the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is sparing no effort, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing a role "important" and "influence" of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and find that the handling is bearing fruit as several newspaper articles reflected the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the 'blitz' media French officials.
What is the basis of both "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did."
The paper then examines the reasons behind the Elysée pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he analyzes.
Policy launched in 2008, which "was then seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and unwarranted."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role in Paris seeks to" demonstrate to Syria what it can attract praise by playing a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows of a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier he said: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we've thanked them anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Reiss returned to France May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role for the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cinderella" which will prohibit teenagers playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask the online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people aged under 16 years, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe this legislation is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," he told AFP Rin Jo, the ministry official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be accessible again at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Companies have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these online games for children whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who ask for free software that can limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world competitions online gaming.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber ​​Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa means the host countries
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of FIFA Thursday means the hosts of World Cup 2018 and 2022, where an eminently political power struggles and lobbying may take precedence over the criteria techniques.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition queen will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That from 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories, Qatar (Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, Korea South).
The list of personalities that are part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, government leaders and Belgian Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is a measure economic issues and policies of a World Cup.
Backstage dealings may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English folder, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and U.S. (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations do not weigh very heavy for the 22 executive committee members at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension of two corrupt members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could well have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which has hosted the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC has handed over a layer on Monday, issuing a documentary pin three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What displease FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
Head of Government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won in 2005 for the Olympics London 2012.
This intense activity will be sufficient does to boost the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not miss assets with its stadiums ready, expertise (Global-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, ​​Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the gloomy economic and fiscal outlook in both countries could shower their ambitions.
The retaliation against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the odds of Russia, became an outsider in weight despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in preparation for the vote" in a thinly veiled allusion to the English press charges against members of the EC.
"They were covered with mud, we try to compromise," he told Mr Putin.
For 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favorites.
World's largest economy, the seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea who built a very nice project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World-2026 to China, ardently desired by Fifa, who would in fact invalidate the Asian Opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, which released the great game featuring futuristic stadiums and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but both countries are more likely than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from low fees paid TV (due to jet lag) by European countries, the sinews of war for Fifa.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had been led to believe that he hesitated.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A term at the Elysee calls another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the element of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So do as if doubt still existed.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a grave, Nicolas Sarkozy declared that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
It refers to the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two terms" has sown a bit of excitement.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far away.
The president did recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 was limited to two the number of five-year periods.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentioned the Presidential on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," had he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Think not that I do not think about the next step."
His remarks before yesterday did not make it more candidate than the day before, they do not make it less.
If they raise comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy for the PS one hand.
But it is not the opening match of Segolene Royal Nicolas Sarkozy pushing to unfold.
Rather it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many POC call a formal order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other.
For the first time right-wing voters prefer the nomination of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP on it," he immediately responded cautiously to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"There will always believe can win," corrects Alain Juppe, resigned to the obvious.
Euro forced the ECB to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year would be an opportunity to specify how the crisis or at least to announce the arrest of many operations unconventional monetary policy should continue until the end of the year.
Crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt will probably not afford to be as conclusive as only worsen the situation more tense now that the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB for resolving the debt crisis of the state in Europe.
She declined to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program to purchase bonds.
"I reserve my thoughts on my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more eloquent about his intentions, merely to indicate that the program purchase of government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we'll see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks bought $ 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market participants, expectations of continued purchases are beyond doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect either significant change in direction.
If lending to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter still carries out unlimited cash allowances as generous terms and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that the scheme is extended for a few months.
"I can not imagine that it significantly changes its program."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates its side Norbert Bram, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its market intervention of public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchase of these bonds to enliven a sluggish market," said Norbert Bram.
Given the extent of exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro zone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"He must at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act accordingly to prevent a runaway yields paid by the states most vulnerable," a leading bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The backup of the Euro is the price.
In Italy, Berlusconi is back round
After a worrisome start of the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a bit yesterday with the reflux rate 10-year bond.
A return to uneasy calm.
Emerging from a meeting with Minister of Economy, regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti described the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable," that the person subsequently denied.
Tuesday in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and price contracts to hedge against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading some to panic Rome.
Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "market turmoil" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy's third largest economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of growth and sluggish tax revenue that goes with it, posing the risk that the State could no longer cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast for Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected in 2011 to 1.1% and 1.4% in 2012 ... while the budget under consideration in the Senate expects 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new supplementary budget could be set up after the holidays, for $ 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," says the Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The economic fundamentals are in order and its accounts are good, we've been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither the short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, Ed), stabilization efforts required to Italy are lower than those applied to other countries, "observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the House of Deputies, following which new elections could be held in late March.
Then would open a period not conducive to decision making in case of serious crisis.
Europeans think the reinforcement of anti-crisis
Christine Lagarde was hammered again yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think it was still demonstrated Sunday in the daytime and at night are obviously supportive, focused, committed to defend their currencies and monetary zone. "
Although a relative, relaxation recorded yesterday on the rate of European government bonds has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can not yet speak of a beginning of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it would degrade the debt rating of Portugal, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, a particular strain on the banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially as "political time is much slower than the time the markets."
Recognizing this gap and the dangers it holds, European countries are stepping up talks to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, the G20 with their peers are going well.
And this also for meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support countries in the euro area in the sights of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore an Asian tour to inform investors of Far Eastern developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise money, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of titles FESF are planned next month.
Yesterday a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support any increase in funds raised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
Countries that are on the frontline, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in organizing the labor market.
Reforms in addition to the austerity measures to effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
One and one held at all costs to avoid requesting international assistance before setting up their own budget adjustments and decide on structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
The European donors, finally, discuss the options available for accelerating the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros raised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand deliver to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in any market in the European sovereign debt, consider an extension of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle actually exists: the "European financial stabilization has, to date, 60 billion euros.
A board that is likely to be carefully considered in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.

The episodes still snowy generate traffic problems, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and may interfere with some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert because of the risk of snow and ice.

Greater Paris metro: first sketches financial
Since the time that the debate over the modernization of public transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions rain.
In the discussion at least.
It refers in particular to the 23 billion Greater Paris subway that should build the Company of Greater Paris.
To start the GSP, the government announced a capital of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme is that amount which will then allow the GSP to borrow a market share of funding for its double loop.
Today, we come finally to the first additions.
The amended Finance Act 2010, discussed in Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices provided to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax for equipment and an increase in the tax offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first one reads in the text of the bill, section 15, is "the benefit of the public institution Corporation of Greater Paris."
It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a redevelopment of a tax office that already exists "in order to modernize, to raise proceeds and allocate the increase to the Society of Greater Paris."
This would bring much?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
It is far from 4 billion.
"It is clear that fiscal resources are in addition to 4 billion euros of capital injection will be mobilized by the state and contributed to the Company in the Greater Paris As the project," reads in the explanatory memorandum.
At GSP, we can not find this offensive system.
"From the moment you set income (both taxes, ie), we can cover studies over three years and then put in the $ 4 billion later, it says there."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn as and when."
COG estimates that 4 billion will start being recorded in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which 4 billion are promised yet conspicuously absent, may cause a parliamentary debate a little choppy.
First public meeting on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and spyware diligence
The Wikileaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a scandal exposed a scandal that appears as a scandal to the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it announces major changes internationally, and anticipates a future dominated by the regression.
But in order.
The first aspect of Wikileaks is confirmation that every record made by a secret service (of any nation whatsoever) is composed entirely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" revelations about American sexual habits of Berlusconi only report that for months could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi is the owner) and the profile sinister caricature of Gadhafi was long for cabaret artists sketch material.
The rule that the secret files must be that new compounds already known is essential to the dynamics of intelligence, not just in this century.
If you go into a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you'll see that each item repeat (of the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars and the Rosicrucians) exactly what was already written in earlier works .
And not only because the author of occult texts do not do original research (or knows where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult believe only what they already know, and reconfirms what they had learned.
This is the mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) the intelligence chief (or he might be, whatever, editor of Liberation), which holds as true as it recognizes.
Top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations about these records they have made so much noise?
On one hand they say that any educated person knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet to dinner, have lost their diplomatic and, except for some small exercises representation, were transformed into centers for espionage.
Any viewer of films investigation knows that, and it is only hypocrisy we pretended to ignore it.
However, the fact of repeating publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a poor light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the innermost secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
As the scandal does not it as in crisis victims and "perpetrators."
But let us come to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of any power as a Big Brother who controlled every action of his subjects.
Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven that can control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited the Highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye's total power.
But when you shows, as happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power can not escape the control of a hacker, the audit report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer can keep its own secrets can it hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said already, a real secret is one empty (and empty secret will never be revealed), it is also true that everything about the character of Berlusconi and Merkel is indeed a empty secret secret, because in the public domain, but reveal, as did Wikileaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were secrets empty it means disempowering.
Wikileaks has done no wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but was too big to Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of injury to a power powerful?
It is obvious that in the future, States will no longer upload any information aside - it would publish it on a poster stuck to the corner.
But it is equally clear that with current technology, it is vain to hope to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in future reports private and reserved?
I know that, for now, my prediction is science-fiction and fiction is, but I'm forced to imagine government officials who move discretely in the stagecoach route uncontrollable, in n ' being carriers of messages that learned by heart or, at most, hiding the few written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in locked drawers: in essence, attempted espionage Watergate has had less success than Wikileaks.
I had the opportunity to write as technology advances now crab is to say backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has reinstated a son on telegraph (telephone).
Videotapes (analog) had allowed the researchers to explore cinema film step by step, by going forwards and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, but now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is to say macroportions.
With high-speed trains, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, and it includes travel, it takes three hours.
It is not extraordinary that the political and technical communications back to horse-drawn carriages.
A final observation.
Formerly, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret embassy.
Now, what are the embassies that require confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France hack its funding commitment
A year after the Copenhagen, it is time to evaluate compliance with promises of funding released quickly (so-called fast start and early funding) made by developed countries.
And large French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $ 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has released all the stops to persuade its partners in the reality of its commitment to fast-start funding: report detailing the activities of its member states, press conference, large side event , distribution of leaflets ...
Operation Transparency is valuable and valued at fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announced that in 2010 reached 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on track for meeting its commitment of $ 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money should be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an extra effort be made without the expense of ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the model that suits him best.
The European Commission has for example considered as the reference year 2009: international funding are maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that funding for "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or overall level of ODA.
Specifically, the total support of France for developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to finance "new and additional" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there are no rules and each chooses its mode of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 equals 1 lent € € given.
Obviously, it is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present one euro we will recover as equivalent a euro that is given ... At most, should be counted as part of its commitment that the cost of the loan to the lending country (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has no need of such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36.1 million) - see EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires it to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (by others) are meeting their commitments with 100% grants.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 € to meet its commitment, France takes only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Pretty hocus-pocus!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France operates a double fraud: one on the evolution of the action in time and secondly on the reality of the financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, it happens to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it has made Bercy arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other member states continue to give s' just lend?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled ...
The chapter on early funding is a small matter of relative short term, relative to all discussions on climate.
But it might be a grain of sand over the huge machine called the UNFCCC.
Hopefully it will not be the case.
Anyway, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of funding early.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect and equity commitments with other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on issues of long-term financing (other crucial chapter discussed now): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would likely increase the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
Warning pesticides ingested by children
A 10 year old child ingests in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study released Wednesday by the association Future Generations (formerly the Movement for Rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "were not statistically significant given the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problems addressed," bought between July and September in foods commonly consumed four meals and a snack in one day by a child of ten years in the Oise supermarkets and Paris.
These meal types, including official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy and 1.5 liters of water per day - and candy, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, metals heavy and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as probable or possible carcinogens and five substances classified as carcinogenic and some 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions like the Centre International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or PE is a concern "notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contains more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proved to be carcinogenic and some nearly twenty residues might disrupt the hormone system.
Apples, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack in the study, shows traces of six chemicals with a fungicide banned in France yet.
Same for the green beans from Kenya, include lunch, which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, ground beef, canned tuna, and even the loaf of bread and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water tests have revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "rich" chemical residues detected with 34 and even considering the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of this "cocktail of contaminants" is probably underestimated, "the study said.
The Alliance Ecology Europe-The Greens (EE-LV), meanwhile, proposed "given the urgency of the situation" a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the "rising diseases of civilization ."
In July, a study by the European Agency for Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereals.
