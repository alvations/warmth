The Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the penal right, the project of cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the boss of the opposition.
The representatives refused in second reading the project of modification aiming the reduction of the penalties for economical offences, that could have opened the doors of the liberty for the former currently imprisoned Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to have concluded an agreement to disadvantageous priori with the Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the call of the condemned in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgement of vengeance politics of the system and provoked a process of suspicions of partiality of the court equally to the west.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of the penal right, on the basis of which the former premère Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 representatives.
It would have been necessary 226 voices to approve it.
Libyan victory
The liberation or Libyan rebellion already has its overcome ones.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is finished.
There remains to determine the conquerors.
As it is custom in the region, the conquerors to the elections are the Islamists, but it is a question of the moderated or radical.
The provisional National Counsel decreed the habitual right of the Charia and we already know of what it is a matter.
The Libya becomes a country without crime for for a flight one cuts the hand.
The women can forget the emancipation, the not eventual respectful dela faith are liable of the penalty capital...
It is the Koran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator the composed corporation of opposed tribes.
In Libya will reign such a order as us not we can represent it and as would not like us surely.
But our manner to live is not unique, is not objectively the better one and would not be probably advantageous for the Libyan.
It is particularly astonishing that the Islamist warriors accepted the assistance with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse it is that this is not a general américian that directed the hit with NATO but rather Allah of which they celebrated the magnitude to every attack.
When it is a matter therefore to look for the conquerors in Libya, the west not in left fact
We participated in the shooting, served the Islam and our poilitiques diverted themselves dictator as political ally without that doing not bring any profit.
After the bad recent experiences of THE Afghanistan and the Iraq, we occupy not militarily the Libya.
It not there therefore any problem for the local ones of itself débarasser of the "crossed".
Is what without occupation of the ground, the oil corporations easily will have accés to black gold libyien.
Maybe not as much and the west finally will be able to praise itself of a protection desintéressée of the human rights.
For little that we prevent these followers of the charia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the remainder of Europe are in the viseur of the investors.

The Czech economy had a growth of 1.5% during the third quarter.
But the PIB stagnated and according to the Office of Czech statistics it is confirmed that one directs oneself towards a progressive decrease of the economical growth.

The pressure of the national footballers did not arrive to pierce the Czech defense that replied in a manner precise to the long shooting same during the first mi -time.
The Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their country.
They created a human shield
Some hundreds of students of the superior schools created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support by this gesture programs it nuclear of their country facing an eventual Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and next wished the death of the HAD and of Israel.
Some hundreds of students of the universities of Ispahan created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technological center of Ispahan where is transformed the uranium.
They thus expressed ouvertement that they would defend the program nuclaire of their country to the peril of their own lives.
The international agency for the atomic energy (AIEA) noted in his last information that the Iran did not stop reinforcing his nuclear armament.

The obese nutrition of a child: does not take any breakfast not and takes delicatessen for the dinner
More of a third of the children of 9 to 13 years have problems of surpoids, 9% of the écoliersont a weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As the watches the current research the obese children originate families that have a style of unhealthy life.
That shows again to which not at is all important the environment in which evolves the human being and the models that the surround.
On the tables of the obese children one finds for example delicatessen 50% more often than in the families of children to the normal weight.
19% of the obese ones had french fries to the dinner according to the conducted investigation with an action of sensibilisation "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of the small big one the sport is not equally a habit, which is now the case of most of the pupils of today - only 15% replied that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Investigate conducted on 900 children
The investigation unfolded itself during the last school year and participated 900 students of the primary schools of Czech.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a chance", action sustained by the general Assurance of health and the corporation Unilever.
Since the beginning it is more than 12000 students of sixth one to the third one that registered themselves to this project.
The one of the determining factors that provoke a dramatic increase of the number of children in surpoids, indeed obese, is l'absence,d'une nutrition correct and not enough physical exercise.
"Only the half of the questioned children indicates for example to eat 5 times a day breakfast in case - to eat - to taste- to dine, that is the one basic principles of a good nutrition", indicates the one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and delicatessen to the dinner
The specialists attract the attention on the Fact that to have a healthy development it is necessary some basic details such as a breakfast in family to the same hour.
In Czech, only 23% of the families of the students eat to the my same hour.
In the major party of the families each takes his only breakfast.
And the worse one that was raised is than a tenth one of the population not at all takes any breakfast.
The breakfast is nevertheless the basis of a good daily nutrition.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children one consumes more often unhealthy french fries.
Almost every student - to say nothing of the weight - drunk every day of the sweetened drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the questioned children does the sport uniformly but for the parents it is a matter of the half, only 15%.
Prepare you your nutrition
A somewhere else investigation allowed children choose (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare his own nutrition from proposed possibilities according to their taste own and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of the Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, to the healthy plan of a nutrition, ideal".
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of cakes, meats and of sweets.
"The most alarming one is notably a big preference for the sweetened lemonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For the lunch it is the pasta that took the first just place in front of white meat.
The children not at all have desired of starchy and the preference for the fish and the vegetable meals was very weak.
Cape on health
The investigation showed equally that the children are ready to change their habits from the moment where they receive the news ad hoc.
"During a check of a group of participants to the investigation that had filled the questionnaire after the meeting of sensibilisation" Obesity is not a chance", one has assité to a well determined will to direct itself towards a healthy nutrition", indicate the results of the investigation.
The more marking was for example for what concerns the sweetened lemonades for the children began giving the preference to consumer water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and the fish as principal dish and would reduce the sweetened dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech spécialté of pellets of flour of bread or of potatoes).
The styliste must be equally a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation item relating to the manner to learn for the stylistes, I put myself a small little in anger on account of the fact that there were some a lot as early as the beginning.
I did not do not think about which was going to arrive afterward.
The expositions of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the personages and a seminary on what happens on the spot.
And it will be worse.
Let's more approach the final examinations and do more await us exercises practice and of the news.
And even when there are courses the Saturdays and Sundays this is truly "stuffed".
This time we have with the director Alenka (to the course there is not any boy) treated of the manner to dress the woman that does not have any standard mensurations.
And women of this type this is the majority.
The one has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without special bend, another of the surpoids.
The styliste must know how optiquement ammenuiser of the wide arms, extend a neck or well to add necessary bends.
We arrived thus to underline nicely the personage and equally to not to dress in a manner too visionary of the types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If there is for example a difference between the size and the hips of such manner that the skirts or the not past pants of the tout,cela is worth the blow of itself to be done it to do on measure.
And you will not regret it for the clothing that impeccably falls is inestimable.
In a skirt on measure you will feel a lot better than in the one that slips in permanence, winds itself and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For the one that have a masculine appearance were able to allow themselves a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or well again embroideries.
There are evidently a lot of examples d 'various appearances and I am satisfies that I have the very week to sort all received the news.
But I have equally fear that had consideration to what I must do to the house there are some too.
Every trainee reçut a fame to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take in consideration the current appearance, the type of method of the personality as well as his appearance.
I will have "to dress" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know country the Secret of Victoria.
At the far end of me, that pleases me, for it is better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera that took almost hundred kilos the latter times (do not take my declaration, please, completely to the serious one) or well the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from the magazines or look for on internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard,comme one says for the final result, expresss our personal style as well as our relation with the graphic creation.
Reflect equally on the graphic party of the styling is equally important.
The dressed styliste not thus only the physics but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on given products the tendencies for the bags to hand, the coats, etc. ..).
Mario Kamenik, styliste and graphic designer, we maintained of all that.
But that, ... to the Sunday
The styliste must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diversified aspect to the meeting of full Saturday of information on the different types of personages.
Honza Pokorny, styliste, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of method and Well Renc, method photographer.
Jakub recalled us that the method is an illusion and the styliste should know to use it.
And a talent styliste knows to work with a single in a manner different clothing.
Variability is for this essential example.
As for example this trench-coat that has itself to be carried in a manner classical with a John and a t shirt as a light coat but also it can dress equally the nude body, with pumps and to take it in photo as a dress.
Or well it suffices to climb back up the sleeves or the collar and to have immediately a new look.
"Play with that" it underlined.
But I particularly appreciated the following counsel: "For the work need to know you the rules perfectly".
"You next can begin to there to contravene", said Jakub.
Finally I understand why one strives to learn these rules, what to do with, towards what, why, while in the method magazines one see sometimes something of other.
No declaration on the method parades.
I know again, thanks to the method photographer Well that the styliste must have a lot more variants of clothing than the one that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (therefore about ten models) I must be ready to in "to recut" at least a group of fifteen.
And also, a clothing and his combination with of other elements appear completely differently that in reality.
We must reckon with that during a creation of a model.
The Fact that the picture and the style do sometimes the half of the succés was confirmed us by Honza Pokorny.
It suffices to look at Madonna that is not a great singer but his picture and marketing did a world-wide star.
In Czech, the approach towards the usage of the services of the stylistes still remains frileuse.
And the known faces consider them sometimes as useless (it suffices that I know something but which I adorned passes to the second row).
And if someone is done to do a styling on our part, we next must count on the Fact that it dictates ourselves with a big probability a completely different size (smaller) that the one that it has in reality.
It we remain next that to sail on google and to assure itself if boulevard infos mention the fame in question, if she slimmed or increased etc...
Honza and Mario put us Sunday on the heart qu 'it does not suffice for the styliste to orient itself in the method and know assemble models.
It must communicate with the people that it dresses and it is thus important to be a good psychologist.
Know guess the people, do not flatter itself, preserve his opinion.
"When one to manage asks you of him to sort his closet and to fill it again elements you not all can throw and him dire,Mon God which horror."
"You will find some matters that you will find pretty and him that you will counsel with what to carry them", says Mario.
This one concretely showed us what all must contain what one calls the "placovka" or bag of the styliste.
It is the one that you hang around the size and that you have on oneself for all that of which need you.
Besides the clearly defined things as the scissors, the rolls for hair loss or well again the pins to wet nurse, one there finds also wire of nylon (that the styliste uses to photograph products as bags, or several hats), special pop videos with which these one closes a clothing in the back, if it is too big (the pin or other type of clasp are not utlisables for they could damage The clothing) or well a kit of sewing.
For that we soyions not only of the people that listen but that tried in a manner practical something they taught us how ressemeller correctly of the shoes.
And during the meeting photo in the workshop where the surface is equals, the sole could damage itself, to fortiori to lextérieur.
And thus stuck us and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors for not to injure itself by oversight.
It is necessary therefore truly competences.
Mario pleased me when it congratulated me for my creation.
The comptence of which I do state is not for my friend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I begin more and more to understand than to do the styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that each in says what it wants.
The speed need The Run disputes itself through any America.
Revision
To the origin a race without problem transforms itself because of a body of stupid errors of people that not some have anything to do in a stuck one in a rut morning movement to the work.
That fills until a certain measure the ambition of each but that does not serve to anything if no one wants to do more something.
The new subtitled party The Run produced big expectations before his exit.
It promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already elderly and go out a game sort from the playable parties that would count itself not only with points.
We were therefore curious how will be the added passages to the course of which ones the principal hero goes out of his car and does what it wants.
As that is done already in the series NFS, the result is completely other that which one atttendait.
It is potentially games of race of arcades but the body pulls towards the bottom because of some useless faults that already exist for a number of years.
This are not really errors but rather the incomprehensible expression of a laziness from the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You took in the adventure of which the principal hero Jack has disturbed problems and to regulate them begins participating in illegal races through America.
You sit behind the flying one on the coast west to San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first one to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided in ten steps and next in more than 50 races.
Which in results that every race is done on another itinerary and the foreseen steps in different environments that distinguish themselves enough well of one another and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling a single instant that the game proposes him something identical.
Certain environments are surcroit rather pretty even if the graphic technical level is same type that the preceding series.
At last this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or well in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in more time in brightened times of an atypical élement.
For example in the desert you meet again in a sand storm that diminishes you in a manner sensitive visibility.
Then in the mountains must pay you attention to which an avalanche you fall not over.
Next to that the different races are well arranged behind one another.
It there in has only only a small number but that suffices.
It there instants you strive to surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classical race) then you will run against the watch (classical duel with the stopwatch) and then again you awaits another duel with an opponent.
Of time in time have you also the police that enters into the game and that stretched to return you the position dificile.
The novelty are the passages out vehicle.
It is a matter rather of una organization interactive when most of the time Jack flees in front of someone and you must help it in sharp on the good button at the right moment.
Nothing of complicate.
What is surprising is there is less than moments of this type that which you await (to be concrete it there in has only three).
To the result it is well as that for this element does not risk bothering and places itself, in the context describes above, in the elements that brighten the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of the preceding games.
Which means that currently it there has nothing extraordinary but one cannot say only it is negative.
For what concerns realistic simulation will have to go you to see elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the conccurrence models it driving goes very well with the type of conception of the races.
Therefore all is ok.
The problems begin appearing after a certain time.
To the diffférence of the model of driving, the one of the collisions is not again to the point.
We not await any this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you not have, at the time of a collision with any object, the least idea of the manner in which behaves your car one, this is therefore not completely good.
During squeezed passing you touch yourself sometimes mutually lightly but otherwise your car one leaves in of the fly crazy.
Or well meet again in crumbs.
Thanks to the upturn system that is not really a problem but that annoys you really.
Upturn is done so that when you broke the face or you took out in the setting the game brings back you at the last point on the itinerary.
But you dispose only only of 5 upturns.
When you used the 5 upturns must recommence you the game since the beginning.
This is therefore more a tool, for the case where something not happens as it faut,que quelquechose on which truly can count you.
Sometimes upturns do not help and it is necessary to find the solution in itself memory remémorrant the itinerary piece in question.
The big snag of this game it is that the same actions meet again in the same places.
For example there are certain bends that it is necessary to pass of a certain manner otherwise that does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place of the vehicles "civil" still in the same configuration that you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a late minute.
What gets angry are the positions when you see to pass easily the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, it is necessary for you is to put itself aside and the conturner or well to brake.
It is equal if you go to the in front of of him for it is "calculated" of such manner that for the given position it always arrives very close to your nose.
The opponents have again other advantages.
During the whole time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without being concerned with the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you to the same place.
That irritates the more in game end when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to any past price in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides you the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter in collision a good number of time.
One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something of captivate and a lot of adrédaline,mais it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And what a pity for through a model of simple driving the game is interesting and the places with so many action as you do not have the time to follow all that happens.
And it is equal if it is because of the unique concept of 50 itineraries, that the order of the races is such as there is not any luck to be bored or well something of other.
The original idea is the car change during the races.
You must pay attention to the gas pumps on the itineraries for you there can change car nevertheless most of the time the one that you sufficed yourself.
The cars are divided in three categories.
The sport cars are ideal for the cities, the American top athletes for the upright expressways and the great cars of sport to the exotic finery on very technical drivings for example on the roads in lace in the mountains.
And the challenge method, that are races in special places that you know adventure, goes very well with the principal system of the history.
You receive not only of the give an award to but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and to the adventure.
When you attained the highest level of driver, different objects begin unlocking itself:
This one connects itself one line with the function Autolog that among others compares your obtained results with those of other players and you obtain other functions in the community.
The one of the blows more difficult to understand is the position of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (that resembles) where you roll in the obscurity on the ways (that resembles).
Your speed informer indicates you between 150 and 200 km/hours (to priori) and behind you arrive a subway oar that sends you the car directly to scrap.
To the compilation we had a discussion during some days to knowledge if someone actually reflected at the time of the creation of this game or well if the authors take us really for fools.
The technical party of the game is not extra,mais left it visual is in pleasant general rule and in certain really great cases.
What bothers is in more extreme positions, the not held imagery the level and in certain in a manner tragic cases.
That concerns especially the accidents with a big number of participants when a fluid imagery does not serve you more to anything.
The sonorous party is good and the track is at the choice.
With the intention of to please the biggest number and particularly the more to the young public a new sonorous track was created in the style "I mix all", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid errors could say us without fear that it is a matter of the better production of NFS the latter years.
But this game gives the not impression to be finished.
Entertainment is really well but prepare you to what the faults type you in the eyes with the force of a reflector of airfield.

Vicenova, Ambassadress near the Union européeenne:
The Czech ones behave as négativistes and euro-skeptic
"The treaty of Lisbon radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I did not expect a war also lasts".
"That will last 5.6 years before the position calms itself and that all the players get used to their new role", this is as well as Miléna Vicenova began his exposition to the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassadress near the European Union.
When she succeeded describing the different organs of THE E.U. and their in a manner relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a big number of lecturers of the faculty of Right of the University Charles could envy it, she showed to which not at all she takes his motto "understandable and ouvertement about Europe" very to the serious one.
Madam Vicenova paid homage to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Counsel.
"As early as the beginning resounded the critics that it is flat, that it is a round one-of-leather, that it do not can rempplir any mission and I must say that it cut the breath to everyone for it holds his role to the perfection".
"It is a man who knows to listen 27 states members, well to communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take Europe".
She explained the new post of the top Representative for the foreign affairs and politics of defense in the framework of a response to the question: "That is that to the European Union?" "Has which number of telephone must I call?", therefore as an important step towards uniqueness and a bigger legibility of politics of the Union facing the states, as is China or well India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cheese to cooked dough that feels very strong)
Madam Vicenova did state equally of the diary that lived, lives and will live in a time close the European Counsel.
She qualified the Czech presidency of there are two years of succés.
The Czech ones have resolved the financial crisis amount, the crisis of the gas or well organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She qualified the fall of the gourvernement of very negative one and damaged the picture of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation to THE E.U. east in this moment very occupied.
According to the words of Madam the Ambassadress, "the activity beat his full one" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself again now.
It is necessary what's more to approve the new budget septimal of the Union that becomes very complicated because of the current financial situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and regarding economies, which branch will have the right of way, which countries will be helped the more, the less, all is to be resolved in the framework of the future negotiations.
Madam the Ambassadress recalled its slogans with which these she arrived to Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I do not like really the abbreviations, the foreign words, the gibberishes that no one understands.
As must understand the citizen that it is true that to Brussels no one does the round or twisted gherkin pickles, bananas differemment big or although no one forbade us to do the syrecky".
She wants more better to use the environment of THE E.U. and see more of Czech ones in the European institutions.
An Europe to several speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassadress the Czech ones have the reputation to be euro-skeptic and of people that see the things only in their negative aspect more positively.
Of more she is grieved to see a so small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to her, of several factors, as for example the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support on the part Czech.
Besides a Czech presidency to succés she next underlined the force and the cooperation of the group of Visegrad.
"Believe me, when come towards me the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French says me: 'Hé, that estce that you done over there, that still causes this group of Visegrad? "and it not at all is happy".
According to Madam Vicenova, in a future close it is new hard rules in the matter of budget political that await the member nations.
It is the concept of an Europe to two speeds, if this is not at several speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the Euro zone and of others outside the zone."
"We have the space Schengen, we have equally the institute of cooperation reinforced".
In first place it was said that cooperate between them the countries that the want and those that do not desire it remain in their corner."
"There will be a lot d 'institutes of this type and there will be an Europe really to two speeds ", expects Madam Vicenova.
From the standpoint she equally appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases according to which ones all the themes having an impact on THE E.U. must be debated between all the members of THE E.U. and not only the memebres of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of his existence
If someone had to look for the term that expresss to the most near the strategy IBM, the closest one would be "the long term".
For a public wide IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a felt firm as very current and nevertheless since his creation it flowed himself hundred years.
The basis of this strategy in the long term was thrown by the first boss of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
It left this slogan that a big number of world-wide problems can be regulated for little that the people are desirous to reflect.
His slogan "THINKS '! "became the impression around which will develop the gigantic life of a future (and also the title of the internal magazine as IBM began editing in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the business soignement elaborated by Watson.
For us IBM means a thought in the long term of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived hundred years thanks to the Fact that she always remained faithful to its basic values and nevertheless was not afraid of to change all the others around her.
That allowed us during our first century to transform the technology, the business and the corporation.
We hope that in the second century will attain ourselves again more" has délaré for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the thirties, put itself to take care of its employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have the paid vacation, an assurance paid by the employer more a uniform of elegant employee and a well elaborated system of reward for the inventors and the commmerciaux.
Same manner IBM has a relation sytème with the well elaborated customer.
The corporation was at first inspired in the talent discovery- as the one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since this will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - that should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
This one works with IBM for thirty years and occupies currently the post of Boss of the Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM during the last years done which one calls jamy, brain- online storming from what are originating from a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is not astonishing that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm there is close to 500000 people that work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external picture the business that assure him a sure position in the domains of the matters.
"Since the at the beginning of IBM had a concept rather of institution that of a technological firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, economy Professor to the School of economy of Harvard and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to resolve problems of the world of the business while using his technology", added Geogre Colony of the firm of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the says the firm itself there is a difference between to enter on the market and to create this market.
IBM - or well the "Blue Big", as her familiarly is called for the United States had consideration to his slogan- in hundred years she grew until to become the one of the bigger world-wide firms.
This is evidently the technological firm the most polyvalent - she develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services of Counsel at the level of the products of the waiter to the nanotechnology.
She possesses many patents of all the American technological firms and five of its employees received a price Nobel.
Among its discoveries arranges themselves for example the bills distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the code blocks or well the diskette.
IBM met again this year with 220 billion dollars the second bigger technological firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first one is Apple), when for the first time she surpassed in 1996 Microsoft.
Noticed in advance
This are not all the innovations and manufactures that had the preference of the customer and era - IBM for example did not succeed the wager on an own operational system BONE/2, service Prodigy online or well computer IBM PCjr:
"Has to leave the moment where your business is built on the movement in advance do not can you émotionellement to remain hung on the passed," points out Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM does not have any problem to build its bases on a lot of platforms and when they do not work she leaves.
To the difference for example conccurent Microsoft that to the basis is held and remains under the operational system Windows.
A technology perspective
In income IBM, the services, that are formed for a fifth one by software and hardwares, have a preponderant place.
Nevertheless again in 1990 she was with more motié of participation the more representing fort of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM sold active to weak yield for 15 billion dollars, during cettre period she invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of technologies perspectives.
She continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time she surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, that during the big economical crisis equally increased his investment volume.
Being it apparait henceforth that past IBM the current crisis without worried?
The price of the action IBM has progessé from 2008 some burst out of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the firm IBM is to change all but not its values.
One can expect for that to what this flexible giant maitrise of other crises.
History of IBM: From the cheese slicees until the flights in the cosmos.
The corporation IBM (International Business Machine) was born to New York hundred years ago; she had initially the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording corporate Body.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a matter of a brand used by a succursale of a firm to Canada and in South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms of which the history is linked to the years 80 of the ten ninth centuries.
They possessed technologies as for example the old ones "timekeepers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and the departure of the employees.
The architect of the new corporation was Charles Ranlett Flint that up to 1930 presided the Counsel of Supervision of the corporation.
Flint hired the boss of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help it to direct the corporation.
The leader done next of the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest until now the identity and the culture of the corporation.
Watson directed the firm kusqu'en 1952.
IBM,comme says it his name, began with the possible production of all the machines for the matters and the commerce - cutters of cheeses and of meat to the cash registers recorders.
During the four first years during which ones Watson directed, the sales multiplied themselves until to attain 9 millions of dollars and began the expansion of the firm in all the parties of the world.
Watson was for the so irreplaceable firm that after 40 years of direction it is his son who occupied the armchair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
In the years 60 the people and the computers of IBM helped the NASA has to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Between time in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classical PC that determined the standard one of computer of the era with the name of IBM 5150 arrival on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells his computer factory to the Chinese corporation Lenovo, but bought the corporation of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began taking care of counsel and services with a high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM these three last years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a more intelligent planet".
His objective is the intelligent uilisation of the technology in not again exploited domains as for example the transportation and the management of the cities.
With regards to the domain of the commerce IBM developed there is little time a platform "Smarter Commerce" that helps the commercial ones to manage the whole cycle commercial.
IBM has a strong history equally on our territory.
She created his succursale in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first of Europe central and Eastern countries.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is equally the strategic center of outsourcing of Brno.
The Central one for Central and Eastern Europe to Prague and there is also the team of research and development of the world-wide level that takes care of the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I not some want more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, this is finished!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes keeps body and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina hoped again that Joseph awakens of his pink dream and comes back to the house.
Only she was not able to await and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come back to the house, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave refuge in summer to Bartosova in his house, she did not doubt herself that his not held couple.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move Ricany, Pepa pushed not back the singer.
And it acknowledged in public that it liked it.
With the time Darina resigned itself, accepted the liaison of his husband and finished by him to say farewell for always.
Rychtirova is not interested knowledge with that his husband lying.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate themselves there will be not spouse to welcome it on the doorstep of the house.
"This is the biological father of my sons and if it wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put it outside".
"It no longer will be my old liked and lost donkey, but a man with which I have a special relation", left to filter Rychtarova while showing that she detached herself of his husband but that they remain only in a decent relation.
The Fact that Darina closed him the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my woman".
"I will remain with Iveta and will not change".
"My woman set up a marriage on paper and I respect it".
"The corporation continues, I take care of the repairs, garden, real estate one, I buy".
"With Darina one discusses in a manner completely normal but we put to bed not together" declared Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent it.
"We put to bed not together and it does not interest me any knowledge where she goes, with that and if she has an affair.
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love d" Iveta and I take on me the whole responsibility", concluded Joseph.
The worse vices of the women: Does that concern you also?
If you ask the men to determine typical vices of the women, all, as one another, are able go out them "of their sleeve".
My dear ladies, you will know in the lines following by the feminine vices that arrive to pump the blood of the veins of the men.
The purchases
Your half does you the remarks that you are depending on the purchases?
Must you buy yourself at least a clothing a week?
You are satisfies to buy and by packages at the balances?
In your case one can talk about the purchases as a vice.
Certain women think that they should restrict their passion to go shopping.
But you will say, which would withstand the licks window of the stores of clothing, to look for for oneself of pretty clothing and next to try them all in telephone booth (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most of the women to buy is a hobby, that can become for the man a true hell.
Recall you only how many times said you to your spouse that it awaits to l'entrée..
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too big"?
"I would need to slim at least of 5 kilos - I should begin doing the sport?"
"Do I please you?"
These sentences not do they recall you something?
Yes?
You done therefore left these women that are obsessed by their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking you care of yourself but a big number of men is allergic to the Fact that their partner always is complaining about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that more the frequency of these complaints increases and more the women become poisoning.
The odre and the cleanliness to the first place
This is as an infinite carousel.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the grounds, do dust, scour the bathroom - and that two times a week.
You done the remarks to your partner that it walks with dirty feet on the ground own, to the children that they soiled the washbasin, fouled the pane of the living room, and that that gives you a lot of works?
In case you suffer exactly of this obsession, try to have at the spirit that it is necessary nothing to exaggerate and that the order and the cleanliness must not be at the first place in the family.
This inoffensive desire of cleanliness nevertheless can ruin your relations and even family peace.
The work of undermine
"Puts this worn survêtement to the garbage can".
"You count to put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet briefcase has nothing to do on the ground".
If you done on your partner this work of undermine of this manner several times a day, you really will decompose it.
It is evident that you do not think about poorly you want only all is impeccable.
Maybe that if the men knew it, the women would not have to do so many work of undermine...
The slander, the persiflage
The slander, the persiflage but also the insults against someone are also the own one of certain women.
The women are reaches particularly to relations and are thus happy to treat subjects as that, where, with that, how and why.
Maybe that each of leaves us to escape a small inoffensive persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart this is nevertheless a characteristic of the women.
But the worse one are the one that counsel, mock, even despise the others and are for their entourage - particularly to the work in a collective one of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation to the victory of Philadelphia
The attack hokeyiste Jagr participated by two times to the victory of Philadelphia during the game of Monday NHL on the ice of Caroline and is again in head of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the standpoint star of 39 years Claude Giroux, that again did a pass of more and was named the better player of the game, it marked in the two cases.
Jakub Voracek, that plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game declared to the journalists of besides Atlantic that it had warned Giroux that this would be a big evening.
"I said him before the game that it would give his hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Some time this feeling you fall over" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
An instant later there was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes for the disc and presented it to the kicker Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first pause, the local player Patrick Dwyer done a descent, but the beginning of the second party belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr it marked three buts,ensuite Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him".
"I do not want to say that it is the better player of the league but it does really left the three better ones", declared Jagr about his center.
"I had never thought that I would play in career end with a hokeyjiste as him".
"I am really happy with that".
"I want to play on him".
"All these years to the NHL the other players of the team tried to play on me, now this is my turn", added Jagr.
Caroline did a drama of this game for with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shooting she finishes with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not separate from other complications that finished at two against one.
"Pronger carried out excellent attacks in our zone".
"It typed on the disc, I took speed and (Read) left towards the utmost corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit it and I there arrived", describes the last goal of the game from the standpoint Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory in head of the Lecture of the East.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo it goes out in third second because of an injury in the superior party of the body.
The Candiens did not hold facing an experienced defender their advance of two butset lost after a shooting of pénalty by 2:3.
Divided into volumes Plekanec did not transform anything of their attacks.
It is the Fact that the rear line was sick that especially embarrassed the local entraineur rather than of the breaks through lost for they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It is null".
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the remainder this were young".
"But it n 'there has nothing to do, this is as that ", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement that did not suffice and we were not able to withstand".
"We just airplanes to simplify the game, to push the disc outside our zone".
For that we had limits, "added the one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender take part in the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and to the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different marksmen participated uax goals of the Throws, that stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How evolved the prices of the trips since 1989
Up to 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 agencies of trip of state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The trip agencies to this era proposed trips especially in the countries of the socialist pad, for the trips to the west were very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled for the vacation in Germany of the East, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimée and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (the two at sea Black) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorized to travel in Yugoslavia then the system began having an inclination for the west and the trips towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.
The big paradox of the socialist era was that it not authorized nétait for the citizens of the socialist pad (also for the Czechoslovak ones) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union it is necessary for him an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not authorized.
The trip agencies to this era offered also trips to the West nevertheless it was necessary to do the tail the very night with a bag of sleeping arrangements or to have well a "good knowledge" within the trip agency.
And even after that this again was not won.
The agreement for the mottos that was the condition to travel to the west was refused to the people "politically incorrect" that not at all could trip.
The czechoslovak change was not nevertheless échangeable and it was not possible to obtain from the financial means without the motto agreement (western change) to travel to the west.
The Czech ones passed most often their vacation in the country where there were consequently many houses of country and chalets that the Czech ones bought themselves and this habit lasts until now.
The trips of the Czech ones have since known since 1989 a big revolution.
Although up to 1989 the vacation in Germany of the East and Bulgaria were at the Czech maximum,les passed last year abroad 4 millions of days of vacation in the countries of the entire world.
The big paradox of which we do not have conscience today it is that the country more popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely up to 1989 left buses of the Yugoslavia of the era.
The suppression of the aimed in the years 90 of the last century in the countries neighbors of the west provoked a huge wave of short-lived visits especially in Austria to Coming and in Germany.
The Czechoslovak ones did not can during a long time to travel by airplane to the west that each wanted to see at least an instant.
For example to Paris the organizations of trips did to sleep the Czech ones in of the stretched in the parks for our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a trip of Czech ones was at this era to take with oneself his own food preserve, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important instant was equally the interchangeabilité of the Czech crown that allowed our tourists at last after the tens of years of freely to be able to buy the western change.
Our life level as well as the average salary increased what provoked around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing request for the trips the agencies of trips began since 1997 to prepare turns with liaisons by aerial charter that thanks to contracts tremendouy reduced the costs in comparison with what there was before.
At the end of the years 90 of the last century the Czech ones had liaisons without aimed with practically most of the developed nations of the entire world to party the HAD that later facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, when was prepared the first charter one aerial towards an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year of the charter aerial one direct take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is Czech more than 100000 that visit the exotic countries each year!
Again an interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
November 17 2008 the HAD eliminated the aimed for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to arrange itself completely in the group of the developed nations.
In 2008 equally the Czech ones for the first time in the history passed more half of their vacation abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in the history spent more than 15 000 crowns by person for vacation abroad including the ancillary loads. Crown by person.
The general assembly must find his President but that risks finishing by a position without solution "a pat"
Close to 5MOIS already Czech soccer is without President and it risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of the Soccer of the Czech Republic again is not known after again a general assembly that must unfold itself Thursday to Nymburk.
Nevertheless it does not exist not yet agreed according to which regulation of vote it is necessary to proceed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin voting for the one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Divided into volumes Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech soccer.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure called its colleagues has to unite himself and find a strong personality that will direct the soccer in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek soccer went back towards divergences between the rooms of the Association that cannot come to an agreement on a common candidate.
That completely showed itself September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the general assembly uselessly met in the national House to Prague for the negotiation remained blocked and it even was not question to treat manner to elect.
It done not there have agreed on the knowledge fact that has the right to vote to the general assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or well equally the officials invest of full ones be able.
In this unique point there was a partial agreement since this instant with the assistance equally of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the full strength is not possible.
The divergences always continue about the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, that in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not bring anything not more to the position
The opinions on the of vote changed several times but the key point always remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third turn in order not to to fall in the pat.
"The discord apple lies in the following fact: is to proceed according to the statutes or well to find another models", noted the one of the three vice presidents of the Association of the soccer of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional soccer within the association.
According to the rules of the foreseen model wins to the third turn the one of the candidates that will have received the more of voice in percentage within the room for which it is candidate.
The Moravie is ready according to what one says to withdraw itself for that wins the candidate that will have received the biggest percentage of voice of the two rooms.
And the Czech party studies the condition that the conqueror should have the two third at least of the percentages of voice.
"Only that would do to lose next the preceding idea of two turns and that would do to refuse completely the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda that understands the objections on the part morave and according to that the more better would be of not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Divided into volumes Paclik is also agreed even if it considers that the regulation of the elections established according to the statutes advantage the more Pelta among all the candidates.
"I wish that one votes to the maximum according to the statutes of the association".
"For that there is not again crazy ideas imagined by a representative as to the course of the general assembly passed", declared the owner of Victoria Plzen that is candidate for the first time and that in its expositions defined themselves especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimist.
According to him to Nymburk there will be a new President and raw that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a manner constructive.
"The possible qualification today in Championship of Europe should calm everyone".
"Soccer will be again on a wave of happiness and it there aure more of liveliness for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec that among the three has the biggest experience regarding direction of so professional soccer than at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the position is very stretched".
"This is not a problem between the Czech and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations to drawing".
"That can provoke again a locking to the general assembly".
"I hope all just like the healthy reason will win" said Rajchl.
It does not remain a lot of times for a common agreement to all the parties.
Certain réuunions should take place directly to the Montenegro but that can say if the very direction of soccer will be completes for the game.
The specially chartered flight in which had to travel to Podgorice among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and one looked for a variant to take a part of the executive committee in the field of reprisals.
To the end it is the ministerial meeting, that could take place Wednesday, that should be determining.
The Minister of the education of the youth and sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parties within the athletic association the strongest one of the country and to bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: an allocation étatique, the credibility of soccer and also the general assembly of the Czech Union of the Sports that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik leaves in battle for the post of President for it does not see any correct candidate.
If the boss of the footballers of Plzen Divided into volumes Paclik had seen before the general assembly of which the profile would have replied to all that it asks for a new President of the Association of the soccer of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in country for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support it, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current position it was not possible to find such a candidate", declared Paclik to the Agency of Czech press (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to enter in competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl for exactly to try to prevent Pelta from attain at the head of the AFRT that to priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik underlines equally that in case it would win the elections it would hold this post of President only up to 2013 foreseen years for a general assembly.
It would see well in the function one to manage experienced and of high level but that is not secured with the world of soccer.
"I discussed with people that would have the profile", he says.
"For me that was terrible when certain said me that they did not want to be identified with Czech soccer in this moment."
"I would like to let this picture change", it added.
What, says one, bothers especially Paclik is the relation between Pelta and the President of the regional Union of the soccer of Roman Plzen Berbr, man to the famous contreversée that is known in the slides as lobbyist able to influence on the vote of the delegates 'the general assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President.
"If it won, the current state would remain and it would not have nothing new in soccer."
"And with the support of Berbr, that is a merchant of high flight, that would be again less in favor of soccer", proclaimed Paclik.
What shocks it again is the Fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced it there some years during listen in the framework of an investigation on a corruption matter, for which Pelta itself took out some without any pains.
"I do not know which prestige Pelta would bring to soccer."
"And how we would be considered to the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA" says Paclik, that declared there is some time "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
If Paclik would prevail to the vote of Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate that had been supported by Paclik before the general assembly of September that had finished by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"It (Pelta) would be the first one with that I would go".
"It has big capacities"
"It would be able to present itself for example as boss of representation".
"But as to manage Association it would not be capable."
"I do not put the nose in what I do not know", indicates Paclik that in September attracted a big attention when it pronounced himself for the cancellation of the Commission of the referees with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik asserts that it would be at the level to direct the Association.
It takes as example its capacities to direct private firms and that it directs equally since last year the club of Plzen that celebrated with his last May support his triumph in first division.
"I have the force to let something change in the world of the sport and for there to bring a certain culture".
"I would brake the influence of certain groups interested that have for example tendency to influence on the disciplinary Commission and of call, which brings to tasteless positions", added Paclik that not chache his antipathy for the boss of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would envision equally a harmonization of the relations with the Czech olympic Committee of which to be able it lobby with high politics of level would allow obtaining for the sport more of money of the tax on the games.
"This is one of the points keys of which the new President should take care".
"If it is a matter of the tax on the chance games as the informers the political parties, I understand their lines of argument but they should equally say where goes money", it declared.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the club of Plzen as something negative even if asserts itself that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again secured with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"This is not ideal".
I do not see any reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I must return a year and half after", declared Paclik.
Pelta promised again statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to the positions of pat.
Two days before the general assembly of the Association of soccer the one of the candidates to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if it is elected, the AFRT will have again statutes that should put fine in the future to the quarrels about the regulation for the elections.
The official of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday to Nymburk very optimist and thinks that the succés today of the representation of soccer should calm this guéguerre before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September that did not realize itself promised exactly to devote itself to national representation and to the achievement of financial means if it is elected.
It made a decision to be candidate to the last moment just before the general assembly passed and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of soccer and to present it in a wide context.
"The people to all the levels do the soccer since a long time and await that Thursday there is a President".
"They feel that this is the better moment for than someone takes the direction of the Association", it adds, but it is before all lion with the club of Jablonec, worked a big number of years to the Sparta and to the executive Committee of the Union.
It is equally for that that it possesses enough experiences to direct Czech soccer.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is located an euphoria that reigned to lépoque of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately to l" general assembly of June of the statutes were approved that were not perfect as all themselves are noticed some".
"If there was not all these various interprétattions we already would have had a President since September", underlines Pelta.
It is exactly the revision of the document more important of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as personal mission and am ready to some to take all the responsibilities if that does not walk".
"This is a principle without which we not can exist", added Pelta.
Next it strives, says one, of not to confront itself to its opponents.
It declared earlier that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that it reconnait had consideration to his formation in right and that it knows pertinemment that his opponent candidate would be his first vice President.
It not not did more attack since a long time Tonas Paclik that on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"It evolves in the soccer since a year and already had some succés."
"Its attacks were not nevertheless more honorable and surprised many people during the course of the country."
"It is equally for that that some have now doubts on his character", declared Pelta to the address of his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations that it did in September.

"There would be not position as currently with only three teams moraves in the division for the problem is currently to find young players.
As Divided into volumes Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered into the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate its own luck to win.

"If it was elected it would continue surely in what was started with Hasek and would not do notable change among the people in the Commissions."
"It would not want to ruin itself its succés" said Rajchl that has evaluated its rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools of Europe
A jump in the blue one
Of Julia Stanek
Pataugeoires in view of ovni, magnificent swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or does a long walk- can leave to rest its tired legs in baths of gaseous water.
A book shows in which pool of swimming one can experience the more of well-being.
When Iris Meder went in research trip during the 18 last months, there is an object that should not lack in its luggage: his bath shirt.
Extensive on his back in water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and saim in opposition to the marbles Putten that awaited it on the other side swimming pool and did not lack to admire the New meticulously restored Art of these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she noted in his notebook without delay all the worthy details of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were probed of this manner by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in his already published book: "Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath". The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historic palaces of bath in the black forest, "buildings of concrete Hardcore" in the Taunus.
She drove its "travel to the baths more exceptional of central Europe" in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she respectively visited places in Italy, France, Czech, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German one of 46 years is a true fervent one culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she does not have a lot of interests for the sport but ell feels attracted to the totally different water of a manner.
It is irritating that the supporters of the swimming must satisfy themselves to contemplate blue tiles and to suit itself pong of the Bleach while the joggers breathe enchanting perfume of the forests of spruce or can listen gazouillement of joyous birds of the park.
"I wondered a day why the swimming pools have in fact to always be so ugly" said the Viennese one.
"I began therefore a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of water reinforces doubly the architecture
One dived in a swimming pool and the volatile oils of sauna - well-being factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the direction are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the master-builders would have given themselves a little more penalty, the rooms to swim could be a true delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"She is on one hand transparent, but reflects of another side nevertheless the beauty of the building completely."
All the surfaces present themselves optiquement of a manner doubles: high arches, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The volume of picture of small format "Badefreuden" does a worthy report of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of historic well-being - it gives certainly envies to do a jump in the blue one.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid baths of well-being as the bath Széchenyi 100 years old to Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in miskolc-tapolca) as well as a thermal bath bath of which the pools are filled with containing water of the ammonia and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and being located in a building in bottle form.
On the other hand, the heated swimming pools in the open of Switzerland and of Austria offers spectacular views. While of a roof of the bath of Zürich one has the very city to its eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an exterior swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish baths is provided with a window from which one can observe the organization on the skiing track.
Maybe the conception of swimming pool more extraordinary awaits the swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In the winter, vapor rises of the three open plateaus, while in background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
The odor of the Bleach does not emanate any all the swimming pools of the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur odor, árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong odor of oil, that it is difficult to believe, to find itself in a spa health.
The odor originates therapeutic alkaline waters containing of hydrogenates it carbon that is almost black and his silt sticks you to the skin as soon as you leave yourself to slip in the swimming pool - an experience of special spa.
During his quest of the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also underwent disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free exterior swimming pool and in the open Czechoslovakia, she was located in front of a barricaded land.
The bath conceived by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 meanwhile was closed.
While peeking by the window of the building art New in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of the bad grasses between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charm swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building already survived three phases; one can discover not only elements neos Roman that go out since his conception in 1844 but again a moorish room in trains Alhambra that was added him in 1900.
Since his modernization trainer of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the experte in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because she is native Schwarzwald.
"It already is a beautiful yield that of melt train so different constructions in a so tremendous unity", says Meder.
With such a palace, the dived in the thermal swimming pool is apparently only a question minor.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in details the speculation on the first matters
Of Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon his speculation on the first matters?
Of after the news of spiegel-online, Josef Ackermann loaded a group of work to look for the consequences of the speculation for the poor ones of the world.
In January, the boss of the group wants next to draw from it consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans find unacceptable that the banks speculate on the first matters as the corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the questioned people demand even that the German bank and of other institutes of credit stop this matter avenue because it increases the problems of poorest one of the world.
This is the result of an investigation Forsa on the order of the organization of the consumers Foodwatch.
The study leans on a report presented by Foodwatch in mi-octobre.
The author Harald Schumann underlines in this item that the speculation of the stock Markets on the global first matters, pushes the prices up and that the banks divide a complicity to the world-wide famine.
The country of protection of consumers concretely aligns themselves against the boss of the deutsche-bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley be a question of the same manner.
The speculation on the first matters initially was introduced to protect the merchants against the fluctuations of the prices.
But the majority of the experts divide meanwhile the opinion that the gamblers detached themselves offers and asks - and take advantage to the expenses of the very poor one.
Ackermann reacted to the critic differently of the American competitors: It promit of investiguer the reproaches and says, "no matter is worth the penalty to put in game the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
Of after the news of the SPIEGEL ONLINE a group of international work examines currently the accusations of foodwatch-report.
The examination must be finished of here the end of the year, next the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.

It can to result a reduction of the market of the first matters, or well even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann constructs his Picture
The boss of Foodwatch Thilo Bode greeted the new one, but at the same time confirmed its critics towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase of the prices of the food commodities shows of a particularly drastic manner, to which not at all the banks of today nuisent to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be today particularly under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must eliminate all the placements of his wallet, for which money was invested on the food speculations" declared Bode.
"That imports little, for Mister Ackermann, if it is a question of the starving people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in game."
The taken conscience of Ackermann can appear at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect picture, some months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank did to announce Monday that the president of the Board of directors will change nothing to what is foreseen within the Board of directors.
Ll could improve his brand picture with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculations.
And on the subject of eventual losses, it does not have hardly to about it to be concerned - his successor will preoccupy about it.
One on two would terminate the placements on the first matters.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on To Manage it.
So far more than 30 000 netsurfers already participated in the country organization.
Bode published the poll Tuesday, with which the 7 and November 8 the Institute Forsa carried out questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found that legitimate that the Deutsche Bank proposes placements for which of the Paris on the prices of the food products are done.
Many customers of the bank would draw from it equally personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such operations: one on two would terminate, after the poll, all the placements for which of money is injected in the speculations on the first matters.
43 percent would dissuade such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would reflect to the termination of their account to change d" bank establishment.
21st house to Coming
The House that moved
Of Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian house for the world-wide expositions of Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum to Coming, remained empty then fell in ruin.
At present it is again open and holds place of house of exposition.
If one oneself enthusiasm for an architecture according to modern war, for its clear forms, its sheds in glass, its lively and audacious paces its new materials of construction that are typical of the belief towards the technical progress, then the house of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exposition of Brussels in 1958 some is a voucher and famous example.
The House of Schwanzer reçut formerly the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for his construction in steel and in glass, light and suspended.
The construction is considered until our days as an important step in the contemporary architecture.
It returned the architects if famous, that it also constructed the House for the universal following Austrian exposition.
With his legendary house to four cylinders of BMW and his adjacent construction in bowl form to Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His house project as temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exposition in the Swiss Garden to the train station of the south of Coming, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building or physically or technically was not adapted for a museum - any walls to hang the art works, therefore not a good environment.
Nevertheless it also a long time was used, jusqu" to what the contemporary art receipt a new structure to Coming.
Since 2001 the building was empty and is itself more and more deteriorated.
At present the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the House, it carries now the name of "House of the 21st century" and will be in the future used as museum for the contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum Gazebo opened, to which one the house belongs, the first exposition - a luck blow to any view point.
The new departure was accomplished by Agnès husslein-arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Gazebo.
Husslein-arco, promoted an art historian to an among others considerable career in his youth of artistic skater, afterward with Sotheby's, to the museum Guggenheim and as founding director of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she took particularly to well the works of transformation with the politicians and protection of the monuments, she obtained from the public funds and of private sponsoring and in Established the exploitation.
Excepted the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of which foundation carries the same name there were exposed, a coffee and a bookstore itself there are located, and an office there must be constructed.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because it had transformed and widened with sensitiveness the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that it had won the competition, but because it had studied at the technical University of Comes and that for him the house was "an extremely important place" place where it had seen "practically every weekend" the expositions.
It knew the origin project, and it knew the problems of the structure, that perdit in generosity and lightness after his movement to Coming and of by his usage change.
At the time of the current transformations, there were big problems: l" structure was "a gulf in energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows of the facades in glass were changed, insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put and the roof replaced by a glass of special security.
The poutrelles of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the surfaces fill with asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two basements made room to the new exploitation, a panel of sifted light between the house and the road assures the lighting, a bridge drives to the entry - this is almost a new construction, but always the light House Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a complexion protection against brown red color rust.
And the movie room is even exactly the same as which she was formerly.
And all that under close surveillance of competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and not very dear had to be found, and that plaisent also to the office of the protection monuments", says Krischanitz and it attracts the attention on a crude ground in basement.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, l" structure remained supple and light.
That would have been difficult with the House, "that originated Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical history of “Drop-in-the-City".
Such a architecture is located "always to the bad place" and wants despite all "to awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not located to the bad place, for if it is a matter of a blow of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands up exactly the "neighborhood of the central train station" all newly foreseen one, with offices and apartments.
And another blow of luck maybe will produce itself: the House of the 21st century benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, for the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the neighborhood of the Swiss Garden.

The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties to the WORE.
After the matter of the boss Josef Ackermann there is new one to the WORE: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine s" student to the million.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the passed of this giant of the sector recovers it what's more to the WORE: the institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison 145 millions of dollars (106 million Euros), to regulate a disagreement because of the bankruptcy of five big co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
It is a matter of the sale of documents of mortgage.
The regulating one financial markets NCUA carries to the big banks all a series of accusations, and this to have to incite the co-operative banks to do false promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormously value during the financial crisis and induced the banks towards the bottom.
"We satisfied, to have been able be found a solution to this subject, without that the parties start a procedure to the court", said a speaker of the Deutsche Bank to New York.
The Bank did not recognize in comparison any fault.
That is valid also for the Citigroup, that was involved itself to a payment of an amount of 20.5 millions of dollars.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two bank establishments.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) person in charge of the co-operative banks of the WORE and it intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect the clientele deposits.
The NCUA tries to repair the incurred damages of several billion dollars.
The concluded comparisons now are the first ones in their kind.
The regulating one also took others big banks to party and in summer it assigned in front of the Course JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of the question of the documents of mortgage it is a matter of "mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are some at the basis.
When the American real estate bubble has burst in 2007, This was fatal for a big number of bank corporations.
In September 2008, to the summit of the financial crisis, the bank of investment of the WORE Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events already date of some years, at the present time it blows on the American banks a wind of storm.
The investors and supervision authorities filed many recourses to obtain repair or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finances Agency (FHFA) released the biggest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 big international banks, to the two financial ones of the real estate d" American states Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of s" to be favored in nature at the time of matters of mortgages of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also must deposit a recourse with the FHFA, it is a matter here of several operations of a total amount of 14.2 billion dollars for the years 2005 to 2007.
Required authorities of supervision, that the Frankfurter replies of the "substantial losses" but nevertheless without quoting a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the ask as being unjustified and declares wanting to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billions with IBM
Buffett, the guru of the finance, invests colossal sums in the business TI of IBM.
Since March, it bought the actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
Previously the big American investor Warren Buffett explains continually not to invest in computer businesses TI, seen that l" evolution in the long term of the corporations leave to appear only of bad predictions.
It nevertheless read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on the investments in this sector.
It already had of the to understand a lot earlier that IBM proposes especially benefits of services and computer systems for the sectors TI of other businesses.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of knight in the world of the finance.
Consequently the activity TI IBM wins the right to be called at present "Mister IBM".
For Buffett revealed today to l" economical transmission CNBC, that it bought since March of the actions IBM of a value of 10.7 billion dollars.
His corporation holding company of investment Berkshire Hathaway thus became a big shareholder of IBM with a part of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM did never know anything of this engagement so far.
It congratulated the direction, that even during the economical crisis had assured reasonable profits.
"You did a great work", said Buffett strategically.
Put IBM since some time on the lucrative services TI in so qu" exploitation of the centers accountants.
The pioneer of data processing, old of more than 100 years, offers just as well Software and consultation as of the performance calculators of business very.
Buffett had so far rather avoided the businesses of technology.
It says that it invests only in the businesses of which it understands the matters.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks itself rather to the rail frêt, to manufacturers of lubricants or of machines.
His holding Company Berkshire Hathaway possesses close to 80 affiliates as well as parts with all a series of big groups as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former one of munich Rück.
This octogenarian of 81 years had resumed in the years 60" the small business of textile Berkshire Hathaway and had erected it to the row of the one of the more prestigious world-wide businesses, thanks to intelligent investments.
Nevertheless his style of life is modest.
It is for that that it is a face worship for many investors of the entire world.
His almost infallible direction to earn money was worth him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the investment of Buffett the actions IBM increased of a percent to the stock market.
"Big Blue", such as names itself also IBM, has a stock market value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and reckons with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious businesses of technology to the world.
With Microsoft, says Buffett, it wants not there to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media doubt the state of German right.
A newspaper speaks even of a "bloody ideology", that would reemerge at present.
The Turkish assassinations of eight nationals and of a small Greek business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
After this new one, Turkey as well as the Turkish German population reacts with fear and worry.
For for a lot of German Turks the ghost that one believed dead since a long time remade his apparition: since the inflammatory attempts of Mölln in November 1992 and to Solingen in May 1993, it did not have comparable violence anymore with this right extremist context against the Turks.
What there is in Germany a xenophobia, it some nevertheless was never question.
The right extremist network that was detected reveals nevertheless proportions of which the dimension is far from being predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "Such was the title of the publication on internet of the Newspaper Turk" Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" underlines on the other hand that the one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries about the Fact that German authorities could be implied in the quagmire of extreme right.
It is in a reasoned way that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the door of Brandenburg.
It is only two weeks beforehand that the Turkish community of Berlin and the political Germans and Turkish had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of Turkish German recruitment.
It is with cheerful colors that living together had been presented, symbolizing a success history.
The reports of certain Turkish media do the effect of one slaps: "The gift of the Germany for the fiftieth birthday" such is the title of an item in the Turkish plateforme- "Haber X", that refers itself to the context of the series of murders.
Also the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself to draw from it conditions univoques.
"That begins reeking of", Such is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It there underlines that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have brought by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police was perceived manner very criticizes on the Turkish German forums and these afterward had debated success of their research.
Why it did not already come a lot earlier to the spirit of German authorities to do the research in certain suspicious environments of extreme right, astonish themselves the authors.
More of one shows itself ready at least to average indeed drastic rhetoric: "If the matter continues to be rushed, it will remain at the migrant ones anything else only the autodéfense and the armament".
"That will be well the car better defense".
"Internal peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and relevance of the punishment of the body of the network", writes "Selen".
Which that means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attempts of Mölln and Solingen in the years 90 well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen deeply is anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the living Turks here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what the mistrust and the distance by violence acts could unstop.
The attempts nevertheless sharpened the feeling of the we in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the errors of the passed
Formerly this is especially the failure of the political German one after the attempts of which it Turkish in a hurry is itself complaint: Helmut Kohl refused to return visits to the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen it sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish Head of state, did itself to represent to the funeral to Cologne by his minister of the foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted to the era in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the fiscal amount of its loads.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once more how much the mistrust of a lot of German Turks is deep towards l" state of local right since this date.
Besides the efforts of an ampler explanation and reappraisal of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary.
The bank to scandal of the lake of Zürich
The Bank more adventurous of Europe is not located in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS did almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and skates meanwhile of a crisis to the other.
It is a German who must direct now.
This is not certainly what Axel Weber s" was imagined.
After his spectacular departure of the head of the Bundesbank; one had knowledge in July, that it would occupy in 2013 an almost so spectacular post: President of the Board of directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and career lucrative.
Axel Weber publicly gladdened itself, greeted; the Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his recently obtained solidity and did to pass nice observations on the futures colleagues.
"The UBS succeeded the Turnaround".
"I rejoice at the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And nevertheless, as early as the months of September it was clear that all was going to change.
A merchant of titles of UBS to London had diverted all the systems of security of the Bank and had singed about 1.7 billion Euros.
The boss of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the board of directors of the UBS is considered since as suffering - and all ask: When is Axel Weber returning at last?
We already learned that Weber can be counseled bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as communicated it the bank Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.
It is not banker, a lot more professor d" economy and President of the bank, and it certainly would have needed an adaptation period.
At one go it assumes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, that has just proved again once more that she has since a long time deserved the title of "the biggest bank to scandal of Europe".
In fact, the UBS is on one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest administrator of active ones of the world, and other, she skates since years of a scandal to the other.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
That began during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The picture of the Swiss administrator of active, silent and solid, but so crafty one, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she wanted equally to become, in the domain of the bank investment, a very big bank.
Therefore the UBS managed on one hand in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more of originating money of an easy clientele than any other bank to the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks of the world.
That made impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and late professor of bank during of long years to Zurich relate: "I always took the UBS as model of good bank in front of my students."
"From the perspective current, one wonders: how I all simply could have been mistaken me to this point?"
It deeply cheated himself.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli withdrew itself in a surprising way, which was considered previously as a high intellectual as well as an inspired banker.
Some months later one sensed for which reasons it had left.
The division of the bank had singed with documents sub-prime and has of the to do a cross on billions.
To support that, the UBS announced an increase of capital of an amount of 13 frank billion and did a cross over.
For that she effectively found investors, but that, little time before, would have gathered the eyebrows: a state Asian not originating transparent bottom of Singapore and a bottom of Arabic state, that was passed under silence, to the point that one even never learned his name.
That n" was nevertheless that the first blow.
In April 2008 that worsened itself.
The bank had to announce again losses putting a figure themselves to billions, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, that was again in 2006 the second board of directors the more better paid of Switzerland, withdrew itself.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS was located, considering its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and dut to be saved by the State.
The national bank repurchased to the UBS of the tens of billion titles problematic, the Swiss Confederacy gave six frank billion for convertible obligations in actions, for which ones she could become joint owner of the bank.
The very Switzerland was shaken - for she noted to which not at all that can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter so big banks.
At last, the total of the report of the UBS 2007 s" student to more than five time economical performances of Switzerland (to see graphic).
"We were not able to save the UBS once more", says the bank researcher, Geiger.
After the first catastrophe it is followed some himself by the second one.
Already some months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a fiscal disagreement with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, that had cheated the tax office maybe with the assistance of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of 780 millions of dollars - in reimbursement of unjustified profits originating of these operations with a fine increased.
Thus the UBS has more or less published than she had helped the fiscal fraud.
At the same time she lost something that always was his capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss bank secret not was anymore the same.
It followed some himself by the collection of the boss of the board of directors and president of the board of directors.
And exodus of the money of the customers.
Thus the bank had lost in some months his credibility in the two principal sectors of matter: the bank investment because of bad speculations and the management of active ones because of the assistance to the fiscal fraud.
And, as there was somewhat a return to the calm, and as one thought it, that the UBS itself goes out some, it followed some himself by this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single merchant of title singes 1.7 billion Euros, before the bank does not notice itself that something did not turn round.
And one publishes: with the management of the risks in investment bank that does not seem not yet to work.
"With the case Adoboli, one was able to note that the mastery of the risks to too not very changed", says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of the finances to the bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the financial director of a big German bank in is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that she does not have the mastery of the risks in hand."
Nevertheless it was a matter exactly of the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had since a long time take their function, the one to become custodian of the big fortune of the world: no too big risks, but the security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the unshakeable symbol of a reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate.
The central one UBS to Zurich goes again peer with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - she is only a little bigger.
Already the position is classical.
The Bank has his seat to the central train station of Zurich, that drives directly central train station to the lake of Zurich, that surrounded itself by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, the store rents figure among the more students of Europe.
The jewellers as Tiffany's, one finds them here between the stores of Swiss traditions just as those of the candy store Sprüngli.
Since centuries of the Swiss bankers lived here: national bank while going through the palace of the Swiss Credit even to private banks élitistes as Julius Bär.
One arrives in the lobby of entry of the UBS by a heavy door.
To the interior, the walls are clothed marble, in front of are located thick chairs of leather, and next to the logo of the bank, a big label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer research here: the security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or the remote other of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
It would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all the Swiss bankers it does the matters also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become well too big, finds-t' it - especially in the bank investment, where the Anglo-saxons are themselves in addition shed.
Switzerland would not have more anything to say.
"And when well even, they are themselves since a long time adapted to the morals of the Anglo-saxons."
That was in fact the bank of investment Anglo-saxon that changed the UBS, she did the high profits and next the debacle: no European financial establishment lost as much money in the jungle of the sub-prime as the big Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became apparent October 15 2008.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country to the seven millions of inhabitants undertook the biggest operation of salvage in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With even to 68 frank billion about, is 45 billion Euros, the politicians accepted saving bankruptcy the big bank.
How could that arrive?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially to the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three big Swiss banks concluded together a huge group.
A bank was created, which already was too big for the small Switzerland - and recorded continually a growth.
What helped is that the two banks predecessors different of the UBS completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as not at all fort the management of active ones to Zurich and a poorer one, but of course already more strongly internationalisé.
All of a sudden, the international banks of investment favorably had access to a lot of monies, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascension of UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 Bosses of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, formerly president of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team", says the bank researcher, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the big modest intellectual, that itself there agrees very well in model and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one, that traveled a way to the summit with the apprenticeship of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted jusqu" to the end to Wuffli.
And wuffli probably would have committed to the end a decisive error: "It thought that its models were the reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
A thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The personnel of the UBS clearly remembers meetings of the leaders to the course of which ones the boss of the group Wuffli always pronounced the same word of order: to depose Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the investment bank the most powerful one of the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classifications, that informed to this era the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted climb all in top.
Certain steps already succeeded him.
In matter of mottos and of transactions of movable values she played a very important role.
The business counselors, that in had the responsibility, underlined nevertheless a weakness: in the international operations of interests, in bank gibberish "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference in comparison with the biggest banks.
The UBS would have gaps at the level of the products of American mortgages.
To fill this gap, the UBS is itself launched in an adventure, that almost cost him life.
Thirsty of growth, it is just as well the bank itself as a bottom of created management before she in the placements sub-prime American that invested.
She transformed herself in a massive machine that packed and does to pass the based documents of value on the ready American hypothécaires - but that equally preserved risks.
Even when of other banks looked for since a long time descend.
"Again in course of the summer 2007, while the market of the real estate American was in flames, the UBS bought there", says Geiger, the bank expert.
More the euphoria is big more the fall is brutal.
One to manage after the somewhere else, when to put an end to the attempts proved themselves more difficult than one thought.
Posts with UBS became éjectables and are so far shaky.
The one that directs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for that all the suggested models of business disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration to the good management, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (again) to go also far.
But the investment bank vigorously must atrophy, as much as that is clear jusqu" at present.
Next Thursday the boss of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51 years old italo-suisse only was supposed to be at transitional title when the bank separated itself with surprise of his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it imposed: it durably must take the matters of the UBS, communicated Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring back the investment bank to the state of advancement of the environment of the years 1990.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that will not suffice.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what does she want to earn money?
This are the questions qu" Axel Weber certainly already put itself.
It says publicly so far only that it was going to look for with his woman an apartment to Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will be not soon to be in a position to recover itself of a recession, there are also others sign coming weakness of the banks.

The intelligent crows propagate themselves in cities
In a lot of places, rooks are considered as "bird problem°" But the experts assert that these very intelligent animals do not leave themselves more to hunt cities since a long time.
Certain the magnets, certain other want to rid some of them as quickly as possible. The crows belong to the city since centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply themselves because of the dirtiness and noise of the animals.
An antidote against the "° bird problem" is not again visible.
At the time of the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, the experts said that this no longer is possible to hunt the rooks of the cities.
The experts of any Germany deliberate on the possible solutions.
They look for alternate in the cities
The protective ones of the nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The usage of the chemical products in farming destroys more and more the traditional vital spaces.
The hunt, the installation and the cutting down of typical trees of couvaison returned difficult life to the birds.
The crows are under the protection of the nature.
There are big colonies with more than 600 couples of couvaison in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which these Jever, Diepholz and Achim close to Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisings because of the slaughter of the crows in this region.
The critics found the capture of the birds in traps and their killings with particularly brutal clubs.
"The normal expulsion, the évincement, does not serve to anything", noted the planificateur of the city and landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests using the water under pressure or well to cut down the trees, produces often undesirable consequences, said the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser of Lahr to the bade-wurtemberg.
"The animals move away themselves, the big colonies divide themselves and they disperse themselves in of other places."
L "évincement is imaginable only in the exceptional cases as in the hospitals, the houses of retirement or the schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we cannot exterminate them anymore."
The problem does not leave itself to resolve in the cities without the inclusion of periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the évincement of the animals to an aversive packaging and catchy offers, in order to allow them to resettle itself elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologue, Uta Got married Jürgens prospected "panels of info instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relations with the: "We finally more better can bear a button to the the face with a confidence dose in itself."
Jürgens has co-fondé l'Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif of the baskets to the schleswig-holstein, road panels informing on the very intelligent life of these rooks.
This project meanwhile was adopted by the tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the subject of the critic with regard to the noise caused by the birds: "Here a big number of communication, those birds have a lot to say itself".
Intelligence and the skillfulness of the animals are legendary: The rooks use not only instruments of work to arrive to a régal but they make their tools themselves as work instruments.
Éthologistes of the university of Cambridge made a will four rooks recently, to which not at does all arrive the intelligence of the birds.
In an experience, the birds learned quickly that they had to let a scaffolding collapse with rocks to reach thus to a larva.
Without a lot of trainings, they recognized déterminément that a rock had to have certain sizes and forms to let the platform collapse.
In a second essay, the clever crows next had to resolve a bulkier problem.
In a placed cylinder vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not attain their loot with their beak.
Nevertheless, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All the four animals formed a hook with the assistance of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four rooks one succeeds even as early as the beginning.

The cutting down of personal mass
The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: Year Intimate History of the First World War" (beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins by a long list of personages that squeezes you the heart.
A counsel to begin: tear carefully this page and done in your bookmark.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this fictional narrative of Peter Englund, this list of personages will be your GPS, a beacon during these some moments where, as the one of its men or women, you will have disrupted and hopeless in the mists of the war.
Peter Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
It is equally the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, that delivers the price Nobel of literature.
It wrote here a book out of the ordinary that it describes, with exactness, as "an anti-history work."
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; one does not find almost any ambassador or discussion on the strategies and equipment.
It is not so a book on what it happened, it explains, that a "describing book to what that could resemble". One there rediscovers the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, of the two sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to escaladeurs, while going through doctors, ambulance drivers and salesmen.
Some one will become heroes.
Of others of the prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become crazy or will die.
Their lives shake here as the candles of a church: while certain extinguish themselves, one rekindles some again.
The book of Peter Englund separates itself from the traditional books of history.
It brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War summarizes itself only by the terrible war of the trenches on the western forehead.
"Beauty and sorrow" describes skillfully other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern forehead, the Mésopotamie and eastern Africa.
The present soldiers in this book are located under hives; the one pass Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies tsé-tsé are an inflexible problem.
This book is moving as early as the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such a natural catastrophe, such a hurricane Katrina that been able the cordite.
When blows of canon resound to the far, and that you are a mother to the home, are you remaining or do you flee?
Who will come in any case?
Almost no one can understand what it happened, or even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the fact lack was filled out by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, theories conspirationnistes, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows by the individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English wet nurse within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of floats it high German sea.
Their histories principally are pulled memories, of letters and of other already published documents.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or fascinating, but are done more preserve thanks to the accumulation of small moments and of isolated details.
The most approach the deprivation and the capacity of itself go out some.
While relating the German history of a schoolgirl, Peter Englund written: "Substitute, everywhere substitute. "
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, bandages in paper, buttons drinks some."
It follows on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes of the "meat done of rice cooks crushed in grease of sheep (and finished with a false bone of wood); made tobacco with roots dry and dried skin of potato; soles of shoes some drinks."
It asserts that "837 authorized meats of substitution are recorded in the sausage production. One finds equally 511 coffees of substitution."
Certain histories approach the honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards the savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, it is this to what the men were destined, rather than to sit in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whisky to the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to claim that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is not any barbarian behind your starchy and studded shirt.
Inversely, a British soldier realizes that it risks strong to die, and that no one will notice it or will not pay attention.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice itself, one hopes to have a public" it writes.
This is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man choked in secret".
Of other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and again types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economical competition" written Peter Englund, "a war between the factories."
It seizes the arrival of what it calls "a new type within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated and convinced mass ideologically, in well cut clothing, that executes his butcher shop while being sat behind a counter."
The people be a question of unexpected manner; one finds as much basic behaviors that of heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers that attempted to any price to catch a venereal disease with prostitutes in order to avoid the service to the forehead.
"One finds the expression more grotesque in the commerce of due pus to the gonorrhée, that the soldiers buy and s" spread out over the genital organs in the hope to finish to the hospital", it writes.
"The done more despair themselves apply it on the eyes, which translates itself by a blindness to life."
In this translation of the Swedish one by Peter Engrave, the prose of Peter Englund is supple but non-ostentatoire, perfectly adapted to his try humanity.
In tens of short scenes, it seizes the manner in which the war has "released of the exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion for the religion. "
The people begin wondering why their leaders do them a war.
The better works treating First World War are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The big war and the modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or "A the west nothing new", of Married Erich Notices, rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is a panthéon not very conventional.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming one than I read in a work non-fictionnelle.
I will not reveal it.
But this is as if it had arisen of his book, seized of your hands this page where figures the list of people and burnt with a match.
After a false first step, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of officers of Police were implied, certain carrying of the helmets antiémeute.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen for the park Zuccotti would be do more empty.
The operation remained secret of all except of some high placed officers as well as of informed others as early as the beginning that they were going to proceed to an exercise.
The commissioner of Police Raymond W. Kelly was located to the heart of the operation, his presence underlining the risks and the challenges for the department of Police.
There could be not repetitions d" episodes the latter weeks, as the usage of gas pepper against of the showing, that went against the regulation of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the showing.
The aiming operation to clean the park Zuccotti of its showing ones was deployed after two weeks of planning and formation.
The policemen s" were prepared while observing the sequence of the occupations in of other cities.
An exercise capital was organized on l" island of Randall, regarding the operation to the park Zuccotti.
The officers of Police receive a better formation against the riots - anti-terrorist measures that consist in to move quickly a big number of policemen - to concentrate on the neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.
The last session of formation took place Monday evening, side of Manhattan of the East To Fasten.
The given orders to move itself in the park reached "to the last minute", declared a regular, referring to the operation as to "a simple exercise".
"The some policemen that I know and that were called did not know that they would go to the park Zuccotti", declared the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to knowledge that they themselves there would return are at the summit of the hierarchy of the department of Police."
The city knew to keep a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
October 14 last, policemen wanted to clean the park but did themselves to push back by hundreds of informed show of the plans.
The operation of Tuesday implied officers of various unities of Police, of which of the operational forces of the whole neighborhood - tens of officers got used to the particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly declared that a lot of people went and came in the park during the day, to the manner of migrant ones. An hour in the morning was therefore a schedule favorable.
"It suited to proceed when the park counted the less than people" it asserted.
Vehicles of the equipped services of urgency of spots and of high speakers mustered themselves on Pipe Underpants and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drives, close to the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding high speakers seemed to intimidate the showing.
While the officers to the community matters penetrated in the equipped parks of their cutting wind clear blue, many showing ones simply mustered their matters and left.
No stretched one was touched before 1h45 declared the Police, which left the time to the taking care of to muster their matters.
Of other teams of policemen were noticed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests proved themselves necessary.
Present journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Spokesperson of the boss of the department of Police, asserted that this measure had been taken only by security.
But of after numerous journalists, the Police would have prevented them from observe the intervention inside the park, roughly kept by the officers.
Mr. Browne declared that the trucks of present movie cameras of television on Church Street, alongside the side west of the park, were in a position to capture pictures.
While the Police moved itself towards the west crossing the thick fouillis of matters of the showing, including the luggage, the lawn in plastic and the leaf bags fill with clothing, teams of the department of purification followed, cleaning all that the occupying left behind them.
The some showing ones that refused to leave were led. The pictures were broadcasted on Internet little time after.
The principal group of show took places close to the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the Police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people being located to the epicenter of the camp hung on together.
At last, two people linked to trees, declared Mr. Kelly.
The urgency services were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrest took place in the park before 3h30 asserted Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation finished about an hour and quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, close to 142 people were stopped in the park.
The most for "disrupts to the public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, boss of the department of Police, is the officer the more noncom to s" to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, the boss of the department of the detectives, was equally present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations" declared Mr. Browne.
A second group of policemen waited alongside the side is park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were borne on Cortlandt Street, a house pâté to the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
One there saw the Police to widen the perimeter well beyond the park Zuccotti.
Several officers, the equipped most of shields, even would have been seen in the process of pushing of the people to move away them.
Close to 28 people were located of the side north.
The one of the actions more lively of the night took place at the south of the park.
Towards 5h00, to the south of Pine Street, a showing one jumped on collapses it of a car of Police. Of others were noticed in the process of bursting the tires of a truck of Police.
To a moment, a plywood end arose in flying of the crowd.
At last, a policeman and a showing one were hospitalized.
The union of the school assistance sues the city for dismissals
The union that represents hundreds of school assistance having lost their job the last months foresees to file Wednesday a process to the city for useless and discriminatory dismissals. Impact is disproportionate on the schools welcoming disadvantaged pupils.
The pursuits probably are the ultimate weapon of the union, Counsel of the 37E District, to attempt to let the dismissals cancel.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistance, coordinators of parents and other employees, being part of the less paid goods of the city, lost their October 7 last job. The union leaders compared these dismissals to a political vengeance in order not to have left the city to attain a bottom for health care directed by the groups of workers, and that would have allowed closing the gap of in the spring last budget.
Municipal authorities adamantly denied this accusation.
At the time of an audience of the town Council the last months, the chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott declared that the dismissals constituted a part of the closed budget in June.
A member of the Counsel retorted, mentioning that the dismissals of the school assistance n" not in the least were specified in the budget.
The officers of the Counsel of the 37E District declared that they would fill a complaint opinion, warning the department of the education that it would be followed; a press conference will be organized Wednesday to announce officially the judicial pursuits to the supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the department of l" education of the city will constitute the party défenderesse. The pitying will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black color or of origin latino-américaines, as most of the school assistance that lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the lawful department of the city, declared that the municipality again was not able to see the reasons of the process and do not can therefore to do commentaries on allegations.
According to a preliminary sketch of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the neighborhoods the done more discriminate against city to support his complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the more of assistance because of an under uniform financing.
While one does not count any dismissal on Staten Island, and some a scarcely in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistance lost their job in the 23E District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8E and 9E Districts of the neighborhoods south of the Bronx.
Noting the school loss of five assistance on eight employees to the public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of the pupils live in poverty, the pursuits assert that "This is not a neighborhood of easy parents that can bring funds to fill the budget lack."
The budget of l" public school 36 was reduced of 3.26% this year. Funds were equally lost when the city changed his calculation of the additional financing for every inscription d" disadvantaged student.
The union asserts equally that the high school directors could be induced in error by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term "passing" to describe the action, even if "passing" describes more generally the action to move a teaching one of a school towards a group of available workers of which the salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed", and "not only for passing cause".
Finished mission: the Congress finds an agreement on the question of the Libya
It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats found an agreement to the Capitole on the question of the uprising in Lybie.
It will have been necessary a successful uprising, the capture and the death of the dictator of long date Muammar Kadhafi as well as the American implication.
The committee of foreign relations of the Senate will have to take a decision Tuesday next, supported by the President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution consist in to honor the courage of the Libyan while they begin rebuilding their country" declared John Kerry.
"This is a support bipartisan to their democratic aspirations."
The language is maybe inoffensive but the debate on the Libya was never simple so far.
This summer, legislators of the two parties entered in conflict, as well as with the White House, on the wording of several resolutions aiming to approve or not the military role of the United States in the mission of the NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented an aiming resolution to authorize the limited job of force American military in Libya.
The law project was overcome by a wide margin bipartisane and was never the object of a vote to the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the project of law, the Room of the representatives equally rejected an aiming measure to reduce the financing of the American operations in Libya.
The American mission is therefore remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the sufficiently annoyed Congress to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough for him to cut the grass under the foot.
The indecision of the Congress was surpassed by the events.
Tripoli fell under the rebel ones in August and Kadhafi was killed October 20 last one.
The mission of NATO officially finished October 31.
The Senate can at present to act.
The resolution of the Committee of foreign relations "congratulates the Libyan people for his courage and his extraordinary determinations regarding liberty" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the engaged coalitions in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and fantastic professionalisms."
The resolution asserts equally "the national interest of the United States to succeed in an irreversible and successful transition towards the democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the whole support of the Commission of the foreign affairs of the Senate or will she divide the legislators as in last June?
The senator and president of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed itself to the last version.
His spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar again had not read the very last version again project.
Within the Capitole, the Room must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a stable budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bobsled Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote to the Room or to the Senate.
Of other legislators do not have so far successful to let their amendments approve but this is not without having tried.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to the Congress, on a wide fan of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same project of proposed law at once to the Room and to the Senate - and of others are light variations of a preceding one.
One counts at least 15 versions to the Room only of the amendment for a stable budget, and another handful that "would check the federal expenditures".
Certain of these projects of law are identical, but give to their supports - notably the new Republicans that wish to gild their CV - the luck to praise itself to be "the author" of a such measures.
The law on the check of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in last August asked the vote of the Room and Senate on the stable amendment of a budget.
In March, 58 senators one voted in favor of a non constraining resolution supporting the such a amendment idea.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which these the members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to get up the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed an amendment multitude guaranteeing the right to an education of quality and to the health care, among others subjects.
An amendment forbidding the marriage between individuals of same sex constantly is proposed, just as the amendment forbidding the desecration of the flag.
Certain legislators wish equally to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States there are opposed.
As eager as were the members to offer amendments, they are not as quick as by the passed.
At the time of the 111E Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduces 66 at the time of the 110E.
The rhythm slows down in comparison with the beginning of the years 1990, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every other year, according to the figures furnish by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments had not a lot more success than they have some today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27E - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Slaughtered but done not beat" asserts Gabrielle Giffords at the time of his first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man pulled him over to carrying end to Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared Monday evening in a televised transmission, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and declared wanting before all to reestablish itself rather than to return to the Congress.
At the time of his apparition to the televised newspaper “20/20" on the chain ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form sentences and needed assistance to walk.
L "transmission approached his difficult return after the bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, while crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had done a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote the text relating to the ceiling of the debt.
At the time of his first televised interview since the shooting of January, that killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sung - and qualified his restoration of "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years, replied "rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at the time of a special edition of an hour of “20/20", broadcasted the day before of the go out of the new book of the entitled couple" Gabby: a history of courage and of hope".
L "special transmission redrew the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly at the time of the first weeks, one notices it on his hospital bed, the shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She arrives to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragements of his husband.
Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sat in a wheelchair while the doctors learn him to execute simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And at last, his first word: "What".
Some days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of the music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: one notices the Representative in the process of singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and of Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?".
At the time of the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, that passes every day two hours with the doctors, declared not to remind of the shooting.
According to his husband, it was reading him an item on the March 12 shooting when she stopped it and asked for the first time of the news on the six killed people at the time of the incident.
The armed man, Jared The Loughner, is held in a prison of the Missouri and vigorously treated while awaiting the process.
"There were a lot of deaths" declared Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
At the time of his restoration, declared Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"Therefore I would say," Gabby, you were not beaten", asserted Mark Kelly.
You have just been slaughtered.
And you go yourself some go out, to reestablish you and return even stronger than never.
More pity than of respect for the troops
The event: a gala to Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for the veterans without home of the city of New York.
Rock Kid sang a ballad on the powerlessness, frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilot and Navies around him.
The crowd in suit tie put itself standing to its feet to acclaim it.
"The military officers, men and women, are considered as heroes", declared David Saltzman, organizing of the collection of funds of the spring.
A high present military noncom to the gala, to which one participated equally the admiral Mike Mullen, boss d" staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as an orphan sort", wrote the high military noncom in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intention.
I know it.
But this n" was not respect. Just of pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate difficult relations that installed themselves between the military officers and an American fascinated public but often distant.
Praises are lavished to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, declare some military officers.
The public be a question of what's more more as if it was grieved for the men and women in uniform.
"We not at all are victims" declared the general corporal Sean B. MacFarland, that directed the troops in Iraq and will leave soon for the Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only manner to support us is to confine us in the role of unlucky spirits."
It is a matter of a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, that do not wish to appear not recognizing or in disagreement with the public that they serve.
They realize equally that the anger of the returning troops of the war of the Vietnam was well worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on pity take place in any confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of its two sons of the fight with the Navies, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Certain would look at them with respect for they were confronted to rebel and traveled towards distant regions.
Of others would wonder if "a veteran in anger and violent hides itself under the surface" declared Cancian, that fought in Iraq and returned to work to the Government to Washington.
When it looked for a job, it declared, it felt that some people that did him to pass discussions asked in a subtle way if it would be able to hold the blow under the exacting anxiety of a job to Washington immediately after his return of the fight.
"When you approach the subject of the service, you confronted to negative impressions", recalls the colonel Cancian when it speaks with its sons.
The difficulties of the military officers arise, in left, from the American indifference towards the wars.
The victories rarely are congratulated by a country also not very familiar with the army and that sees few direct advantages of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
"As nation, we no longer promote the heroism of the same manner than for the Second World War" declares the retired general lieutenant David Barno, that directed the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead of that, the congratulations of the politicians and people widely concentrate on the depth of the sufferings of a military officer.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of endured services, the number of lost friends or the range of the injuries.
The army facing the growing pressure to hold sway against the rapists
This week, an audience capital will decide if 28 men and women will go in process against the army for a concerning supposed inaction of rapes.
If need be, hundreds of prepared complaints the next one.
The soldier of 1ERE classifies Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant of 11 weeks the night where she asserts to have been violated by a soldier.
C "was in October 2008. She returned to his barracks to Miramar Air Station, to the north of San Diego, after dining with a friend, when she met a colleague transporting a beer pack.
It asked him if it could rejoin it in his room to drink a glass.
"C" was an alarm signal" declares Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan one put aside his worry.
I thought: no, it is 19 years old.
"It is Texas" she says.
"I will have had to follow my intuition."
Some minutes after entering into the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught it the back way, thrown on the ground and violated, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 military, certain others again in service and of others no, will await with anxiety the decision of justice at the time of a historic process that will unfold itself to Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a carried process against the former secretary to the defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not to have stopped the generalization of the rapes within the army, going thus in opposition to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, an avocate of Washington, the process implied at the start 17 pitying. This number rose to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming one to have been violated or abused sexually by colleagues soldiers. They claim equally that the army did not investigate, followed or furnished adapted justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares taking it out on the trimmed ones with braid military officers, for the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure" she says.
"That are the individuals in position d" to eradicate the reprisals culture? The leaders."
The avocate declares equally that since the months of February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, of which the most could be part of future judicial pursuits.
His strategy: instead of mustering all the pitying in this matter - putting thus all its eggs in the same basket - she will file several processes, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The team of the defense, for the Department of the Defense, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a proposal to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defense, and essentially the Fact that the army cannot be followed by soldiers in service or not for caused injuries in the armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the supreme Court, person known as the Doctrine Feres, the federal Government is not responsible injuries suffered by the personnel in active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent to the military service of the pitying" indicate the documents.
The department of the Defense refused to do any commentary.
The things changed since the years 50.
While the women do not have not yet, officially, the right to go in battle, this distinction is registered only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a more and more important role, notably to come into contact with the local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two third in fight position.
It is time for the army to modernize itself declares Susan Burke.
She is not alone to take this fight: three other processes are in runs what's more of his.
To l" school of right of Yale, the center of lawful services of the prepared veterans a matter against the four principal military academies to supposedly have to encourage a misogynous mood.
On the other hand, the foundation to non lucrative goal Vietnam Veterans of America prepared a process against the army, while concentrating on the diagnosis of "disrupt personality" attributed to the victims of rapes in order to give them vacation - a comparatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for the human rights.
His group filed a process in December to the Administration of the Veterans, while accusing them discriminatory practices in the manner to treat the ask advantages for the people declaring having been victims of a sexual aggression in the service.
Nine independent projects of law of one another were presented to the Congress by a mixture bipartisan of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual aggressions were recorded according to the center of intervention and of prevention of the sexual aggressions (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) department of the defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions is under esteem. In fact, according to the own estimation of the Pentagon, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 arisen incidents that year.
The appeared report in March studies equally the percentage of judicial pursuits: in 2010, 20% of the recorded cases in the army were the object of a process - the half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complaining about the matter of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first ones of a series of traumatisms.
In the matter of Lyman, she informs the military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she says, one asked him to relate 11 times in details his rape to different policemen, doctors and ordering.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of his aggressor - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sat in front of a judge, to a process to the course of which one questions it on its sexual relations with his boyfriend earlier the day of his aggression.
Six people testified as morality witnesses for the author of the crime, that ended up to be acquitted.
"I remember day where the verdict was returned" declares Elizabeth Lyman.
"I believed that I was going to begin having contractions. I began screaming after the course."
"I was placed in psychiatric unity, and when I took out, I remember to have said to my order" This was not his process but mine"."
Elizabeth Lyman was constrained to consult a military psychiatrist, that ended up to diagnose a disturbance of the personality, the rendering unfit to the service.
In January 2010, she was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receive any advantage.
The matter Lyman and pitying others will advance or no, this is a long history, declares John Turley, right professor to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington.
Nevertheless, it points out, "A my opinion, they should be able to advance".
Only this criticized doctrine since his introduction is located between them and a verdict.
I always criticized the doctrine Feres.
The army is located of the decades behind for she does not have the same advantages and average of dissuasion put by the responsibility.
"Luck heavily are against them... but it is important that they try", it adds.
These things change only when the vouchers have the will to beat itself.
If the process does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the avocate of the pitying, will muster its hundreds of pitying others for other processes.
"We will continue to beat ourselves against the army on this question as long as there will be not reformation" she asserts.
Where jusqu" to what we would die, the one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy being part of its online anti-immigration opinions.
Monday, Breivik, that recognized to have been taken of a deadly madness in Norway in the month of leaving July 77 victims, was confronted to his first process.
While Breivik has acts alone, it was far being on the cyberspace: it had passed a big party of the time preceding the attack on his computer, to discuss with some one of the nationalist millions of that support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wish in to know more on these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... You connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it n" was not so difficult that that to rediscover them", declares Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a published report recently by the group of reflection of DEMOS on the numerical populisme in Europe.
Facebook is crammed of personal so many information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers simply could use the advertising tool of the site to find the people that they look for with a scientific precision - the manner in which the mercaticiens do it since years.
L "team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a millions of half members are fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She targeted them with announcements, but instead of to link up them to a new group one or produce, the announcements invited the users to reply to an investigation. The put questions concerned their education level, their attitudes facing the violence and their optimism as for their own future.
While coming into contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and its colleagues were able to question 10.000 supporters of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new manner to do the research", declares Jamie Bartlett.
Certain results not at all are surprises: the online supporters of the right groups are rather men, young and against the immigration.
But surprisingly, "those that associate online and outstanding activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those that remain behind their computer screen."
L "study of DEMOS is only an example on the manner in which Facebook became the new essential tool between the hands of the scientists.
The reflection groups, the researchers in medicine and the political scientists use the site to study all the subjects that touch the health questions as the social tendencies, thanks to the "I LIKE", publications on the walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users that add in average three contents a day, the "supernova of the data" generates an explosion regarding research, increasing the number of works of research of which the name of the site appears in the almost title 800% in comparison with the five last years.
For certain researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the Fact that it allows you to study people that you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you attempted to carry out investigations on the people on the part British national, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to return to the party, but they would never have authorized you to enter", declares Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all that - you have directly access to their information. "
Of said others that the site could offer a means to identify and to treat the sanitary and problems social.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the university of the wisconsin-madison, and of its colleagues, the studying young ones that spoke on Facebook of their exploits in condition to inebriation had enormously more luck to be alcoholics than the discreet students to this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the counselors, could oversee the site and intervene to help eventually a student of which the statute would speak too often of alcohol.
"You cannot treat a problem if you do not diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, the behavior and the development of the children to the research Institute for the situated children to Seattle, asserts the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children to risks, and that would not be in another recognized case."
Facebook also attains constantly to the news of its users.
L "team of the site that takes care of the data studied statistics concerning the position in love and the day of the holy Valentin, the participation rate to the elections of mi-mandat of 2010 and an index of national happiness (thanks to only available the news - the champions of numerical liberty have during a long time sustained that the site could render available his data treasure to other people to ends of Research).
But the users of Facebook know that the site observes them, that that their plaisent or not - in exchange for to be able to play Scrabble with a friend that is located to thousands of kilometers, the site is authorized to attain your information.
But that does it pass itself when the users of Facebook are part of an investigation of which they did not even hear to speak?
While the researchers have of the record well defined as for the manner to collect the news otherwise that while going through the Internet, it is any online something else.
"I do not believe that a big number of users already thought about the Fact that a researcher can study their profile" declares Neil Selwyn, sociologist to the Laboratory of the Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 that it took while observing the walls Facebook of its students.
"As much as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the methodology question.
Even without going through Internet, it did not guarantee anything that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and which you done in the reality are two totally different things", asserts Neil Selwyn.
This is the reason why, despite his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notepad and a pen remain the better tools than one can use.
"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with the people," it declares.
"The social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social one, is in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman" : first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man having admitted to have organized the two attempts that did 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described itself as a fighter "resistance" at the time of his first apparition to the process that unfolds itself to Oslo.
"I am a military order of the movement of Norwegian resistance and Templiers of Norway", it explains in front of a room of full audience of 500 people.
"In the matter of the competence of the court, I challenge it, for you hold your organization mandate supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue for it "did not want to leave him the timeliness to use this process to express its opinions."
For the same reason, it refused to leave Breivik, that brought with him a speech on paper, speak with the parents of the victims at the end of the audience.
The judge Nesheim equally asked the Police on duty Breivik in detention twelve weeks of more, forbade him to speak with the media for four weeks and warned it that authorities would oversee of very near all the visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
About thirty parents of survivors and of victims were present to the audience.
Some came in the hope to look at Breivik in the eyes, of others to be sure that it would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in the audience with the intention of to see the end of the process.
"I found it cold and inhuman" declared a survivor of Utoya to the chain of Norwegian television NRK.
"I n" was not comfortable, but I personally a little advanced after seeing and heard the suspicious one."
Clothed of a dark suit and of a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during the whole process. It looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes while entering and going out of the court.
Despite the strange idea according to which Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that it was not crazy. It equally declared that there is not any proof that it has acts with accomplices.
The July 22 attempts seem therefore to be the work of an extremist one rather than of an entire group of radical ones, which some will console maybe certain.
But that not reduced sorrow or the confusion feel by the very nation.
"I will have preferred that it resembles a monster, but this is not the case", declared a parent of a victim.
"That would have been a lot easier one."
7 lesson of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, to the movies this week
After the death of Steve Jobs October 5 last, certain ones compared to it Henry Ford - distinguishing itself by the technical genius and inventor of modern data processing.
But which the fans of Apple can find of more revealing one in a discussion of Steve Jobs rediscovered recently and that will be broadcasted this week in first party of a film on the principal markets, is at which not at all this creative spirit had understood the processes and flow of work of the products.
It was without any doubts a creator and a dreamer. It identified himself to a hippie one but was equally very meticulous and organized, as well as an ameliorative one of flowcharts - a man that believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease leaving them to think that an inspired idea does 90% of the work... [but] A considerable quantity of handicraft separates an inspired idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bobsled Cringely developed the televised series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series redraws the birth of the computer, and it sits during more of an hour with Steve Jobs for a long one and rare conversation.
To that era, that did about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It already worked hard on his new computer business NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small party of the discussion with Cringely is used in Nerds, it declares that the principal copies disappeared in the transportation.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a video completes is rediscovered in the garage of the director.
This video, lightly climbed back up, is the basis of the film of 68 minutes entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, that will be broadcasted to the movies Wednesday and next Thursdays.
For someone of known to hate discussions deepen, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiast to expose technological philosophies and its commercial strategies.
And unbelievably attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the responses come a long moment after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which ones Steve Jobs clearly weighs its thoughts, with the intention of to bring a precise response.
One discovers equally moments where the perfectionnisme of Steve Jobs reappears, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him blows of elbow to do it to accelerate and pass to questions or subjects of bigger importance.
Filmed before l" era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, one finds an aspect strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what it considers voucher or of bad one with the other businesses and is part of his own vision on the future of data processing.
It is a thing to read the evaluations posthumes of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something crude and of inspire on the man who we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of the magnitude.
It has a vision on the manner in which the things can be and must be.
It explains them then the continuation placement in work.
Here a summary quick one of seven sequences remarkable of Lost Interview:
On the manner in which it learned to direct a business:
"During all these years, I always asked: 'Why done you the things? "and the responses are constantly the same: 'Oh, simply because it is necessary to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one reflects in depth to the things in a business.
This I discovered.
Steve Jobs follows while giving details on its efforts aiming to simplify the accounting with Apple.
Perplexed as for the manner in which the costs were recorded - one begins often by a "standard cost" value at nose view, then tailored with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the timeliness to play a turn to the Pope:
Steve Jobs relates the anecdote of the "Blue Can" that it created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to pirate the telephone networks and to telephone free in long distance.
The device was the object of numerous written to the previous one, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Can as an appropriation act is contagious.
It describes the manner in which him and Wozniak have tested the can while using a public telephone, while passing a call then while being connected of a network AT&T to another while bypassing as much as possible satellites.
"We envelopped the ball of different things a half a dozen of time and you yelled in the public telephone and that you arrived a minute later to the public telephone of side issue," explains Jobs while laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Can, we learned that we could to create ourselves something able to check billion dollars of infrastructures in the entire world. "
We did not know big thing both of them, but we knew to invent a small thing able to check big things. It was an unbelievable lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would have an existed day without that.
Steve Jobs follows while relating a wonderful turn that him and Wozniak perfected: it telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Can to the beautiful environment of the night while being done to pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak with the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in crazy laugh just before that the Pope did not awaken.
On his love with the technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett) :
To l" age of 12 years, to the hunt to the spare parts to make a fréquencemètre, it looks for the number of Bill Hewlett in directory and makes a phone call him.
Shortly after their conversation of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs obtains a job of on time partial summer with hewlett-packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. C "was the only business that I had seen to this age and that formed my definition of a business and the manner in which the employees are treated."
Steve Jobs afterward became the one of the employees HP to visit the laboratories of research of the business, situated to Alto Palo, where it discovered the "first computer of never conceived office."
It was as big as a suitcase, possessed a small cathode tube. I fell some in love.
The adolescent one that j" was returned with HP and began writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of the innovation:
To several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about invent again products on a head blow.
At first of his career, while it installs himself to sell some cards of printed circuits, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working to only 30 days of credit, it dût to take care of the assembly as well as delivery of the devices finish.
Later, with Apple, it remembers met difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... one screamed me over while claiming that it is necessary for me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I in had enough, I took out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved itself unbelievably reliable.
On the big businesses that run out of steam:
Well before it does to relive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the manner in which many industrial leaders were going to be mistaken and lose the check on their part of market.
"Let's admit that you worked with IBM or Xerox, you done a better copier or a printing better one, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the business meets not more success.
The sales and marketing can do it to evolve, therefore [it is these types of people] that end up to direct the businesses and the specialized personnel in produces are put to l" gap of the taken decisions.
The genius in produces that drove to this monopoly position is completely rotted by the people that cannot imagine to conceive a voucher produces in comparison with a bad produce one - the handicraft require.
This produced itself with Xerox...
Xerox could have held all the computer industry.
She could have done ten times his current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the years 90...
They pulled out the defeat to the victory.
On the innovation as artistic form:
"A huge party of handicraft separates an inspired idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, she changes and growing."
You learn enormously on its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Certain things that you cannot do, the électrons are able it, the glass, the robots, the factories also.
You must keep thousands of things to the spirit (these concepts) while assembling them to one another.
At last, the decisions are taken by personal taste. It is a matter to try to expose you to the better products than the men created, and to try to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso said a day that the good artists copy and that the big artists fly.
We always have shame to fly excellent ideas.
This is in left what returns exceptional Macintosh. The people that worked over were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, that simply proved itself the better computer scientists to the world.
If this is not for the computer science, they would have done the extraordinary things in another domain.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the right of health while the course meets
The day where the supreme Court meets to closed door to examine the question of political discord, to knowledge if the opposition to the law of the President Obama of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at the time of a dinner sponsored by the office of lawyers that will defend the matter in front of the high course.
The event was situated last Thursday, when the nine judge met for an aiming lecture to discuss the petitions for examination.
The one of the matters in question concerned a process filed by 26 States protesting the reformation of the ambitious health care voted by the Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for the campaigning conservative to the national ladder.
The judges suited to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is awaited in next March, and the result probably will be nature to favor the destabilization of the presidential race of 2012, that will be in full expansion the moment the decision of the court will be returned.
The lawyer that will be held in front of the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, will be probably Paul Clement, that served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The lawful office of Lenient, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozens of offices that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Corporation (Federalist Society), a group of long dedicated date to defend the conservative lawful principles.
Another office that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents the one of the commercial associations that protested the law, the national Federation of the independent businesses (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, that presents a huge financial issue in the result of the litigation.
The dinner is been anxious a hotel Washington some hours after the lecture of the court on the matter.
Itself there was located, among others, Mitch McConnell, republican top of the Senate and declared opponent of the law of health.
The guests star to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present to the events of the Federalist Corporation during years.
And it does not have anything that goes in opposition to the deontology rules.
Indeed, the judges are exempted code of driving that governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were it, they would argue doubtless by the code of Canon 4C, that stipulates: "A judge can attend collections of funds of the organizations linked to the right and other although the judge cannot be a participant, an honor guest, or figuring on the such a event program".
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas nearby of two of the offices of lawyers of the matter, as well as to a business having a massive financial interest, sufficed to alarm the activists of governmental ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference with regard to the code indisputably the declarations of several judges that the Course respects the same applicable rules to all the others judge federal", declared Bobsled Edgar, president of Common Causes.
"The judges drank and dined and to a collection of funds of gala with lawyers that have cases in instance in front of the court".
Their presence and their participation to the collection of funds of this stormy event any complaint of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed few consideration for the critics asserting that they mix too easily the matters of the course with the group diary such as the Federalist Corporation.
And the woman of Thomas, Ginni, is a militant conservative one of high profile.
Besides, the conservative ones claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan that has an ethics problem, and non-Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general supplicant of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were reaches at the level of the court of first instance.
Its critics did pressure for that Kagan challenges itself to hear the case, saying that she too had invested herself in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan did not give any indication that she would do it.
Boeing records an order record of 18 billion dollars for airplanes of line
The airline company Emirates orders 50 Boeings 777, had line bi-couloirs, with the possibility of about it to buy 20 of more.
Boeing sells equally six Boeings Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market to more of a billion dollars.
It does not have nothing extraordinary to what a company receives a contemplating order 50 of its products.
It is on the other hand all a matter when the company in question is the builder of airplanes Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had attained the sum record of 18 billion dollars.
All so unbelievable one is of that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, an expression of now growing of future orders of airplanes.
In published anticipations Monday, the company of Chicago considers that the airline companies of the Middle East will need in the 20 next years of 2 520 airplanes of a total value of 450 billion dollars.
During during the weekend, Boeing informed order of commercial airplanes the dearest one of his history - 50 Boeings 777 bi-couloirs.
It is the airline company Emirates based to Dubaï that passed this order pharaonique.
Boeing announced to the Aeronautical Parlor of Dubaï of 2011 that the airline company is equally likely to buy 20 airplanes of more, which student the Total Amount of the order to 26 billion dollars.
Of another side, Boeing indicated Monday that the company Oman Air ordered six Boeings 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flatters itself important economies of fuel and of conveniences for the passengers.
The amount of these six devices s" student to more of a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," declared Neal Dihora, analyst of the Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have an immense value."
To the Middle East, the productive countries of oil possess a lot of their airline companies.
They have therefore not only the means to pay these airplanes, but one climbed of the price of the fuel - usually prejudicial for the airline companies for it represents their expenses more important - would be them not so harmful since the country would earn money with the climbed of the price of the oil.
This is an important point for these companies will be less susceptible than others to cancel or to differ their airplane orders when the price of the oil increases, signaled Dihora.
"They have a cover of natural risk", it said.
The order of Emirates reinforces the predominance of Boeing on the market of the big airplanes carriers and helps to brake the attempt of encroachment of the competitor Airbus with his airplane A350.
The victory of Boeing to the parlor of the aeronautics arrives four months after the announcement of Airbus to put back the beginnings of the biggest version of l'A350, that competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushs back its beginnings for some to increase the sprout after the request of its customers to increase his capacity of load and his autonomy.
The actions of the company Boeing increased of 1,5% to attain the 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten to the elections of the Michoacán
Luisa Got married Calderon declares that the drug trafiquants helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRAY in the race to the post of governor.
The sister of the president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost his access attempt to the functions of governor of the Michoacán during violent elections, and she declared Monday that the drug trafiquants favored one of its opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRAY, was in head of the race to the post of governor of this State of the west.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the whole process of vote and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the country completely", signaled Luisa Got married Calderon to the radio during an interview on Mondays following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized themselves ballot boxes, installed road barriers... and obliged the people to vote" for the PRAY.
The PRAY governed the Mexico for seventy years jusqu" to lose the presidency in 2000.
But it organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRAY hopes to win l" presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have distanced itself only of few Calderon, that was in head of the polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, candidate on the part conservative of his brother, the Party Action National, or SECTION, refused to recognize Vallejo as conqueror.
Silvano Aureoles, left candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, that occupies currently the functions of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidential ones of 2012 for this divided and left unfortunate.
Aureoles equally refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of l" State, denied any link with the trafiquants of drug and sharply counseled to the other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán a long time was dominated by the specialized coalitions of the drugs in the illegal dealings in marihuana, of heroin and of méthamphétamine.
It is a matter of l" State of origin of the president Calderon, and it chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against the trafiquants in December 2006.
Nevertheless, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the SECTION was murdered while it did country for Luisa Got married Calderon, and many candidates renounced locally in the country by fear.
Nevertheless, for the PRAY, as corrupt as the elections of the Michoacán seem, a victory will help the party in his momentum.
The man that one awaits to represent the PRAY in the race to the presidential, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and declared, "I think that this victory is very encouraging regarding next year."
The BASD incites sharply the Asia to come to the aid of the Euro zone
The Asian Bank of Development asked India and to the China to prepare itself to help the Euro zone go out of the crisis of the sovereign debt to avoid a décroissance in the long term that would prevent the development of l" Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the general director of the based BASD to Manila, declared that the two economical powers to the growths more quick of the world had "to do all that is in their Power" to accelerate the recuperation of the zone monetary by the bias of the International Monetary Bottom or agreed direct bilateral.
It dissuaded to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of an "indifferent eye" and signaled that an Asian financial support alongside the leaders and resources of Europe would allow d" to avoid a collapse in the long term of l" world-wide economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Consequently whoever can help Europe go out of the crisis is useful", it said to the Financial Times during an interview during the World-wide Economical Forum to Bombay.
"Asia can be protected jusqu" to a certain one not at all but she is not under cover."
"Therefore if China and India can help, that nothing not about it prevents them."
The latter months, the Euro zone seriously was shaken by a crisis of the sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan dangerously soared and the Prime Minister of Italy and of Greece resigned.
The flourishing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe did to gush the fear that l" world-wide economy does not return in recession, and gave rise to the call of the principal emerging economies to combine itself to help the Euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag presaged that the transports IMF any Asian assistance, but it also declared as this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the funds of financial salvage of the United States, the European Funds of financial stability - offered a bigger strength of negotiations to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the minister of the Commerce and Indian Industry, indicated that "India done all that she will be able" to help the Euro zone being given that his own economy suffers now of a decrease of the exportations and of a drying up of the arrivals of foreign capitals.
"No one wants that the Euro zone remains unstable and restless", it said.
"We have monumental challenges to raise and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This not is a choice, this is an imperative one, because where we would find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Of others support that the economies in development such as India should not help the rich Europeans while they do facing their important own economical challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor to the university Brown to the United States, declared that it would be politically very difficult to let an assistance accept to Europe to the 1.2 Indian billion, of which at least 800 000 screws with 2 dollars a day, indeed less.
"A day, they will discover that the Greeks take their retirement to 50 years and that they leave on vacation to the sun and they will have trouble to swallow it", it signaled.

Harsh warnings of the Pentagon on the reductions potentielles of the defense
The Secretary to the Defense, Leon Panetta, did climb the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the budget imminent automatic compressions would undermine the national security. It released a reaction in financial chain of the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of the Afghanistan, while going through the gatherings of civil ones.
The Pentagon already digests 450 billion dollars of reductions for the next decade, but feared now that an additional amount of 600 dollars or more of compressions is imminent if the Congress does not reach to an agreement on the expenditures.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry", declared Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, r-arizona, and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina.
It declared that the failure of the Congress to succeed in a resultant budget agreement in that one calls confinement, would induce 23% of reductions as well as the freeze many new projects.
"A reduction so important, applied thus without discernment, would return most of our vessels and of our projects of construction inexécutables - you cannot buy three quarters of a vessel or of a building - and carry gravely attained to the other efforts of modernization", writes Panetta to the senators.
"We would equally have constrained to separate ourselves of a number of our civil personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we almost certainly should send civil on vacation without salary regarding to attain the objective."
"These changes would shake the faith of those that support our military officers and would damage seriously our preparation."
The reductions eventually would touch the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of the operations of contingency abroad directly is not touched by confinement, the war efforts negatively would be affected by the engrave disruptions in the basic budgets", warned Panetta.
"The contracting personnel would be reduced, inducing delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contracts that support the war".
"The personnel managing the salaries would be reduced, inducing delays of payment to the war suppliers, and the lawful and political support".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking details on potential impact of the automatic compressions on the Ministry of the Defense.
"The consequence of a confinement on the department of the Defense would have would release a quick decline of the United States as undisputed world-wide boss of the military power".
"We fiercely opposed to this drastic action", declared the senators in a common communiqué Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"This is not a consequence with which can live us, and this is not certainly the one that we should impose".
"Confinement is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and she should not have to produce itself".
What the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of the senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the reduction Pentagon, remains to see.
Panetta was more and more virulent on the subject of the possible compressions, even if it reached itself to the more top posts combining Pentagon of the years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White and knowing House than it was confronted to difficult choices.
To a press conference the past week, the secretary to the Defense painted a dark picture of what could arise - a military officer with a shell, but no kernel.
"This is a vessel without sailors".
"This is a brigade without bullets".
"This is a hunt airplane, without enough pilot formed".
"It is a tiger in paper, a barracks army, of buildings and of bombs that have not enough formed soldiers able to accomplish the mission", declared Panetta at the time of its preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"This is a depressing force, poorly prepared and incapable to do facing potential opponents".
"De facto, she invites to l'agression."
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciated specifically how new reductions could "to generate important operational risks: response delay to the crises, conflicts and catastrophes; harsh limits to our capacity to deploy us and we to engage in the world; and risks unacceptable assumed in operations of future fight".
And Panetta declared that certain of the biggest projects of defense could pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and certain just to the first stadiums of the planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joined Strike, a new foreseen bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new vessel of coastal fight and the new vehicle of land, that would replace the Humvee of the army and navy.
Put an end to the development and to the essays of the F35 could generate 80 billion dollars of economies on 10 years, but its said supporters that this is an essential step of improvement and of response to the threats potentielles of China and of rival others.
How to spot a lie
A look on the recent headlines indicates to which not at all the deception and the lie are omnipresent in daily life.
The republican candidate to the presidency Herman Cain is occupied to exchange allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing the other to lie.
The administrators of Penn State were accused perjury to have prétendument cover with the reports according to which these a soccer trainer to the retirement sexually attacked boys.
Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a microphone open asserting to the American president Barack Obama that the Junior Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and contorted countries.
The member of the Congress of New York and fame of the Internet Anthony Weiner, is passed for an idiot while emitting quickly denials indisputably by proofs irréfutables.
The former candidate to the presidential John Edwards was accused violations of the financing of the countries linked to the extramarital cover of a liaison.
And then, none of the one that lived the history will never forget the media circus that the president Bill Clinton released while lying at the time of his second mandate on sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The cardsharping narratives to the tests of the school and university are legion.
There were cases where the teaching gave the responses of the tests to the students in order to be done well to see on their performance evaluations.
The mentors that should teach the opposite send the message according to which lie and the cardsharping are acceptable.
How much deception do we meet?
On a given day, the studies show that you can hear of 10 to 200 lies.
Indeed, a lot of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that the foreigners lie themselves to three returns in the 10 first minutes of their encounter.
Detect or spot lies is an essential competence that each must obtain, at once for personal and reasons professional.
Far from being a game of similar corporation to, let's say, riddles, where the objective is to shout: "I had you", the detection of the deception is a serious branch of knowledge base on scientific data collected during the six last decades in of prestigious universities having taken a research in depth of such projects, notably in psychology and in physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the myths more old on the lie were demystified.
The liars look in you the eyes.
They stammer, redden or shake themselves not always.
Not in to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A detector of qualified lie can discover the truth while examining the structure of the declaration, the microphones expressions facial, the formation of the question and the response time.
I passed several years to examine scientific results in the vast body and always emerging of the knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of the deception is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include notably the hiring, the interviews, the negotiation or the management.
The good liars are skillful to well to read the others, while putting them comfortable, while managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how the others the perceive.
We know of after the research that the extroverts lie more than the introverted ones, that the men to say more lies "centered on them" while the said women more of lies "centered on the others" - habitually to protect the feelings of someone - than the married people lie less often to their partners than the people non-brides (but that the lies that they relate tend to be huge).
We know as as if you perceived as a heathen one, the others will feel less guilty to lie you.
How can you say if someone lies?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This one calls "to establish the data indicators".
That helps to furnish a reference point to measure the later changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laugh, the vocal quality.
You must know if someone stirs normally its feet in permanence in order not to launch unfair accusations when you see it to stir the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indices of verbal misleading behaviors and not verbal.
Consider these indices as red flags, not proofs of the deception.
The misleading people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember of their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean itself towards an exit, change in a manner significant posture or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a posture change when all the difficult questions are passed.
The questioning ones indicate often falsely that discussion is finished just try release the post-interview reaction.
Also, paid attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped while using the passed while claiming that his murdered woman was living, releasing a national research to rediscover it.
The misleading individuals can equally use a left behind language: "I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat completely a difficult question.
The verbal informers the most common ones are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" at the time of his response to a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
That returns the perceptive rather than factual response is often a red flag.
There is not magic formula for the lie detection, but the development of the competences to recognize the deception is possible.
These competences will improve the luck of whoever to avoid the victimization by arnaqueurs in their professional and life personal.
The plan of controversial oil pipeline will be disconcerted after the threat of late approval of the United States
Some days after the administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of a project of oil pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - giving rise to the anger of the unions while appeasing the environnementalistes - the corporation trying construct the said oil pipeline that she is ready to rediriger the project to put back it on the rails.
TransCanada declared Monday evening that she will move the projected pipeline outside the ecological sensitive zone of the dunes of the Nebraska, and is confiding that the project anyway will win his approval.
The corporation announced the decision at the time of a press conference to the Capitole of the Nebraska.
The official one of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, asserts that the company remains confiding that she will end up to obtain the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different itinerary.
That does after the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay his decision of granting of a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential itineraries allowing avoiding the zones of the dunes of the Nebraska and aquifer Ogallala, of vast underground sources of water.
"This is a true way towards the before", indicates The Terry, a republican of the Nebraska to Fox New.
The new examination of the environment ordered by the Department of State probably would have pushed back any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officials deny the implication of the political one in the decision.
Obama, in a written declaration last week, described the decision as being the decision of the Department of State, and expressed him his support.
The oil pipeline of 2.735 km would spread itself Canada towards the gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700.000 barrels a day since province of the Alberta towards the refineries of the Texas.
For this to do, it is necessary for him to cross six States.
It is hated by the ecologists, but liked by work groups, that bet on the 20 000 estimated jobs linked to the oil pipeline.
But the opposed legislators of the Nebraska to this plan do pressure that a law for force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and aquifer Ogallala, a major source of drinkable water and of irrigation.
The study of environmental impact in course of the Department of State found that the project would put only environmental negative limited impacts, but the industry of the energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered a distinct investigation of the process of examination, centered on two questions.
The one is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, that was a counselor of country of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent an interest conflict for the program.
The other is knowledge if a business that was hired to take the initial study was an inappropriate choice of by his relation to TransCanada.

The Course validates "the analogical cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of the signal analogical by the digital ones is one of the change more important than the world suffered the last years
The supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has nonsuit constitutional controversies that the Senat and the Room of the Representatives formulated against the presidential decree that advances the said "analogical cut" of 2021 to 2015, for the eight necessary votes to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, herein the president of the Course, Juan Silva Meza, considered that the president Felipe Calderón did not surpass its granting when it emitted the decree that details the actions to follow to make real the transition to the earthly digital television.
With this result, constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited in order not to to have attained the qualified majority of eight votes for that the Course pronounces itself on the constitutionalité or non-constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The project of sentence, elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as not constitutional, because of the Fact that the regulation regarding radio and television is a granting reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in parking ticket of the principles of hierarchic subordination and of reserve of law.
To favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero same.
With this argument, so the Senate as the Room of the Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to protest the decree and while admitting the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions foreseen by this one for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the ministers has resolved to nonsuit also the complaint formulated by the Room of the Representatives, without discussing the project of which the minister Sánchez Cordero is so responsible.
In his intervention, the minister president said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the direction that the federal Executive cannot structure through general norms the measures for that the public administration itself there gets ready.
"I do not consider not more than if it did it one would affect the autonomy of the regulating organ", and it recalled that the planning of the political public one in strategic domains as the sector of the telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, that has for constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
The substitution of the signal analogical by signal digital is the one of the changes more important than the world suffered the last years and that translates itself in a better exploitation of the ghost radioélectrique, a better quality of the signal and more of chains.
Postpone the change, has it supported, would be to postpone the profits of the digitalization that implies a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "for that understands also economical, social, political questions and of national security".
These questions, has it underlined, "demand the operation of all a system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economical direction of the State, includes a granting group that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
It recalled that a big number of country of everyone already finished the digital transition and they did it through of the Executive, in vexation on account of the fact that they had the technical strong specialized organs.
One cannot conclude that the Executive, while emitting the protested decree, invaded of a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, for it assures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws emitted by the Legislature, it assured.
One analyzes the possibility of a discount "votes by vote" to Michoacán
According to the data made obvious by PREP, the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbal processes.
The possibility of discount "votes by vote" is a reality in the matter of the electoral process this year to Michoacán, where according to the data made obvious by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total verbal processes.
In this direction, the president of the General Counsel of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María of the Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that some days ago, the passed November 9, the electoral organ approved a series of guiding lines to harmonize the local norms to reforms it federal in electoral matter.
One will remember that Michoacán did not confirm or his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved reform them little before of that finishes the legal delay for that this electoral process can enter in force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication in the delays foreseen by the Law of the Newspaper Official of the State, with the argument of that it had some objections.
The same November 9, the Supreme Course of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has resolved constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Strength and qualified as "invalidates and illegal" the vote of the mandatory one state for reform them constitutional, for it does not have the right of the "to punish or protest".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "votes by vote", María of the Ángeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the guiding lines corresponding by the General Counsel of IEM it will be possible to realize partial and total discounts the votes by the local electoral organ.
Thus, partial discount of vote, of one or more electoral packages, it can himself that: the results of the verbal processes do not coincide; there is not verbal process of ballot and discount in the file of the ballot box is located with the president of this one; or there are errors or evident deteriorations of the verbal processes.
Of more, total discount of the received votes in all the ballot boxes of the election will be able to be realized when there is an index on account of the fact that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of the respective election and the one that obtained the second place in the ballot is equals or underneath of a point of percentage; to condition of that at first of session exists a petition expresse of the representative of the Left and/or coalition that presented the second one signaled candidates.
Total discount of the ballot can realize itself also if at the end of common discount it results as the difference between the winning supposed candidate and the one of the second place is equals or inferior to a percentage point, to condition of that it exists the petition expresse of the representative of the political party of which the candidate took out second, case in which one will exclude the electoral packages that were Object of partial discount.
It is necessary to mention that that is the position of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first one and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total verbal processes.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of the Italy to present the new government that will do facing a crisis that put this country by the economical disaster
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the president of the Italy to present the new government that will do facing a crisis that put Italy by the economical disaster and jeopardized all the Eurozone.
A communiqué of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
One awaits that it presents a composed office in his majorities by technocrates, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said that it was going to present to the president the result of its conversations with the political parties in his essay to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult phase", said the European former commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of its commentaries indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "framework now is well traced", it added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a time does more reduce than normally, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that pushed the costs of his debt to impossible levels to support.
The new administration directed by the European former commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
While underlining the pressure on Monti for that it hurries, the instability of the markets to place the yield of the Italian obligations BTP to 10 years by over of the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot this government".
We think that this Government is the last timeliness for that Italy goes out of this position of urgency.
The possibilities of success of Monti considerably were stimulated by the support on the part PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, to which one the crisis obliged to resign the past Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti will have a good result", declared to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary on the part of upright center.
The support of PDL, the Italian party the biggest one, is significant because until now a lot of its members had opposed themselves to the Government of majority technocrate that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be of the reform unpopular austerities.
Any locking or delay in its efforts could provoke a new one and devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches added themselves to the pressure while observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday its consultations with the political parties, unions and employer groups and youthful organizations and of women.
It will finish his turn of meetings Tuesday to the night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, that empowered an extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of the past week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt now came back to of levels criticize between the uncertainty on the success of the new Prime Minister.
To save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillions of Euros, would be too for the current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the future elections, foreseen for 2013, in spite of the generalized predictions on the Fact that the politicians will give him only the time to apply reform them before advancing the elections.
Monti said that it would like to include politicians in his office, but the big ones leave insist on the Fact that this one must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections in front of a process obliged by the financial pressure.
Political sources signaled that the reciprocal mistrusts and the disagreements between the parties complicate the essay to include political faces.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to the one of the costariciens
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned ones participated in 50 meet.
A huge contrast to the one of Costa Rica, if one compares the 22 summoned ones by the two countries for the friendly one of today, to 15:05 hours, to the National Stadium of San José.
While the national champions and of Europe, the number one of monthly classification of the FIFA, count an ample register of inter-selected games of classifies A, the Three-colored one only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was attained on Fridays past in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers that play in the League of the stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain to the year an excessive activities in championships of league and national cutting and disputes in European cuttings as the Champions League.
To all that it is necessary to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated éliminatoires of the European Cutting and the World-wide one of soccer.
The footballers costariciens, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to a zone, as the Concacaf, that is considered of a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the bigger record of the Spanish Selection is the one of the custodian of goal Íker Casillas, that the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 to London) equalled the record of the former custodian of goal Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 meet international.
Casillas will play today against the Three-colored one and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral flying Barcelona, some has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even were recognized the week previous by UEFA to quotation of the centennial others of the team ibérienne, mentioned Zubizarreta above with 126 and the before centers Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready of the centennial figure is located Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, the two with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the part costaricienne, and close to Michael Umana are located the left lateral Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the kicker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Blocking Michael with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Shines López with 35.
The less.
Those that some have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain figure Pricked Gerard (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
National side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The remainder does not arrive even to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, to Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin again.
The historic kicker of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that in records the more, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has includes the country in his turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" To Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bass player Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its better ones on Sundays next concerts on the National Stadium.
They awaited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them this will be also a become dream reality to produce itself in this country.
It is that the bass player and founding member Jeff Ament assured, while speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, the past week.
The group is located in the South American wing of his turn of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 fact his unique stop in Central America.
That day will present themselves on the National Stadium, from the 19:30 hours, next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the national ones of Tired Robertas.
That is an extract of the conversation, of which the rescript completes is located in The Nación on Internet.
For its followers costariciens, the Fact that Pearl Jam will produce itself to Costa Rica is a become dream reality. Do you Etes-vous conscious of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality for us also.
This one is our second time in South America and Central and so far that was grandiose.
I passed to Costa Rica only once the vacation; this is a so beautiful country and I think that we there will be able to pass some days.
That we emotion therefore to carry our music over there.
I ask you, for there is a devotion sort towards the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
Which is your message for your more fervent followers?
Thank you for to remain next to us during all these years.
It were necessary 21 years for that we arrived to Costa Rica; thank you for to have awaited so and we grieved on account of the fact that so many time had to pass until this concert.
Some said people already that his concert is the BIGGER show of the year.
That adds a little pressure to your visit.
Certain of the BIGGER shows than we offered during the last 21 years took place in the two last weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that that put ourselves in form for this concert to Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient of ourselves there to produce.
We like this country, we like to go surfing and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the better countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to go surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend that lives to Tamarindo and the waves are unbelievable over there.
My friends always went to go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to quotation of Mexico, are big places to go surfing; it is as well as we learned it, through the gents that like surfing.
In visionary turned it, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As us are ourselves never products over there, we have no restriction in the matter of what we can do.
We will try to do the BEST POSSIBLE show, with a big variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to offer to our fans a good and catalog various.
You never repeat the catalog.
Does to what have itself that?
I believe that it is partially because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each magnet of the different songs, this is for that that it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the catalog that we did not interpret anymore since very a long time, that helps us to remain concentrated and we surprises for that recalls us the reasons for which ones liked us these songs and that we can have forgotten.
That does that the show is more interesting for us and consequently I think than it becomes also more interesting for the people.
With this turn, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
While looking at behind, is it difficult to believe all that you succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
In first place, I believe that none of us had imagined itself only we were going to form a big rock group, and the Fact that we did it for more than 20 years done than that seems a dream.
We continue to relate our blessings and the fact to be able to continue to do the music together we emotion a lot.
We like ourselves and we love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places of the world to which ones always wanted ourselves to go.
The things could not go better for us.
What means for you does it to have been a basic element in the creation of the grunge?
That always was an honor for us to form left this group of big groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is not very common.
Of time in time, a group arises of a city, but this is a lot stranger when five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.
We trusted and this is an honor for us to form left the group of Seattle.
We play again with certain of them of time in time.
The past year participated us in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were at the Canada with Mudhoney, we saw to Soundgarden in their turn, therefore we are lucky to be again friends with all them and it is an honor for us to form left this sound of Seattle that has arises.
This is as very strange as a group as the your maintains itself united and with the same members for so many time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) rejoined us 13 years ago, and only that is a lot more time that a lot of groups last normally.
In first place, I believe that we are all lucky one to be again in life and, in second place, we preoccupy all for the others.
We are all intimate friends and grace has that there are musical boulevards that give liberty to each to test.
We have confidence in one another with the music of each and that could not go better.
Your relation with the word fame was not easy; nevertheless, thanks to your success, you were able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, that was easier for us to find a balance.
We assure ourselves on account of the fact that we pass not too many times in turned for it is easy to fall in this game of the big multitudes and people that like your music.
If one does not forget that the people are there for the music, that help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect the music and what brought it, without putting itself in head the Fact that one is famous and a rock star which interests not really to none of us.
How do you remember of your other project, Mother Coils Good?
I think that we wrote good songs and at first that was grandiose.
We were a group during almost three years and we did not publish a disc before death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of frustrations for the Fact that she lasted if little and the most important one is the Fact that we are again very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen a song or I see a photo I think about the unbelievable person that Andy was and how it did me to laugh, that always was a Pleasure to work, to laugh, to talk about the music, soccer and by far something else with him.
It was a surprising human being and it lacks us.
The Tired national group Robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with of different suggestions and that one was the group that we liked the more, therefore we are impatient to see what Tired Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.
Do for what change you always the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This one is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), therefore I do not know.
It is he who the sings and I believe that it does it with the first words that it imagines.
As bass player, which are its influences?
There are some so...
Among the first ones of which I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Sweeps, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There is so many influences, that I could speak all the afternoon on the bass players that I love.
How did Pearl succeed Jam has to maintain raising the grunge in vexation on account of the fact that this one no longer is fashionable?
I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I in thought, that reminds me the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the one that have arises at the same time and, if that is raising now, I believe that that is wonderful, for it is a music that is worth the penalty to listen and the groups as Mudhoney do now the better music than never.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now this one became more positive.
Does to what have itself this change?
It is interesting, for I believe that there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, as The End now Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if these can ring a not very positive ones.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow and there is a traumatism in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things begin influencing your art and your music and these songs, doubtless, represent that for me.
I think as as one also can be happy and even as that one can do the obscure music.

Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the timeliness of the summoning beyond the debate on the honorary ones
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again debates it on the role of Collserola to Barcelona
Towards the environment of the years '80, in the middle of the apogee of the already extinct Metropolitan corporate Body of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed notices of promotion of Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Of more, she contained also a comparison, some amount, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of a lot of people, superior limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the axis north south, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference no longer was Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the bear Yogi.
That was the position until, in September, the city hall summoned a méga-compétition composed by 16 competitions for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door puts back to the park idea, without any doubts.
This is that, or well someone wants to put doors to the field.
The question apparait all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, so in the matter of his organization as in the matter of the reflection on the city is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost a recurrent theme of which two members of this former class of elected officials speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And that is exactly one of the rare opinions on which ones coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, that itself there presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal forehead "it is necessary of" to debate on "the mountain forehead" for the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the one of the pâtés of green houses was not taken to end.
"It is necessary to leave the basis that the extensiver park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among others things for his big accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for which entitles it of "carry Collserola" contains a "traps glossary" : it is not necessary to think about these "as the accesses to a park, but the demarcation of certain zones in which ones it is necessary to act".
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the town-planning world, qualifies the suggestion as "challenge intellectual" with "some perils".
Perils that divert themselves from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the lived experience in the years '80 and that had in the zone of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own demarcation of the borders on which ones one can construct.
"To limit something means to already establish the following step", that is to say, his passing.
"It is necessary to think about again town-planning instruments, of planning, for the current ones [in reference to the General Plan Subway (PGM)] can provoke authentic disasters".
While being held more to the question, Modol agrees that, while simplifying, the pouring region El Valles of Collserola "can be heard as a park, the one of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that it already exists a work done by the Employers of Collserola that "must not be lost", while thanking for the timeliness that the city hall offers to his corporate body to intervene in this project "as early as the first moment".
Of more, it hears that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe one drives that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" if this profiles technical must direct the teams multidisciplinaires ("all a success", he says) that one has of the to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the response to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, for bases of the competition it lacks a global vision of Collserola: "One summoned 16 transverse competitions - he says - in the direction mountain sea, but there is not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the zone in his body".
This does, at least in this case, that it chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
Of another manner, a project for that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with the one of the architect of the door neighbor.
In his opinion, yes, the city hall should guarantee that the immediately superior band to the one of Ronda of Dalt should foresee, in any sound extension, an equipment zone that carries out a soft transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives to Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the been founded legal strength of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the initiated process against him for the claimed blackmail
After passing 72 years stopped, Manual Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the been founded legal strength of the Casino Red grants him the pardon in front of the Second Penal Court of the District, that follows a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attempt of the Royal Casino, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and video in which these présumément Manual Jonás demanded him the economical payment of a quotte for that the mayor of Monterrey allows the clandestine functioning of the house of game.
After the public denouncing, the Floor opened a penal process against the brother of the mayor PANiste and September 2 this one was stopped and maintained in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 of Offences Patrimoniaux, it was transferred to the Center of Detention 1, situated in the Former Neighborhood of the capital of the State.
It there remained during the 49 following days when one pronounced him a second order of detention after the agent of the Public Ministry has nonsuit the offences of corruption and organized criminality.
The 19 of October it was transferred to the penal center of Cadereyta présumément for have done to sing with a million and half of pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but it passed only some hours in the center of detention of average security for there were threats of death against him.
Authorities allowed him to continue the withdrawn process in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of the Garza.
October 25 an order of capture was emitted by the clerk of the Second Penal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, that said that after almost two months of investigation there were sufficient confirmed proofs to determine the guilt of Jonás, as the one relating to the encaissement of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the house of game in exchange for to allow his functioning.
This Monday, the been founded legal strength of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented itself in front the judge José Shines Pecina to solicit the pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region; consequently it could recover his liberty during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and that of the associates of the house of game had been the one that had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried of not to communicate the name.
By virtue of the file 197/2011 one grants the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and later one will not be able to present any complaint relating to the filed process against him; one will not ask him any repair of the damages and no not punishment more.
After the audience of the been founded legal strength of the house of game, to 15:50 hours one ordered the immediate liberty of Larrazabal Bretón.
The clerk of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved itself to the prison municipe of San Nicolás of the Garza to communicate to Jonás that it had been forgiven legally and his file would be classified.
It will communicate him also the order of immediate liberty as the judge emitted.
The secretary Dionisio Perisies Jácome gives communicates the details of the aerial accident in which lost his life the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportations (SCT) informed that the results made obvious on the accident in which lost his life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in completes structural integrity, without that the pilot can try a forced landing.
For a press conference, Dionisio Perisies Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transportations, mentioned that before take-off of the aircraft, the pilot noted that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that unity had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees to 25 meters where unity lost the fuselage".
It informed also on account of the fact that unity was conceived for 19 people, therefore this one satisfied the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
Of more, it said that the investigations done in the zone of impacte do not retrieve the appearance of pieces to the ground.
"In a research one retrieved that there is not pieces or components of the aircraft in another place, impact presented itself in a structural way.
"The helicopter had been conceived for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements to transport them.
The ground presented a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last some months, she even can last a year.
To his turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State worked in speed of cruiser and that happened on a rising soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal functioning cruiser at the impacte", he says.
During the press conference, the tenured one of the SCT, Perisies Jácome, enumerated six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the normative aeronautics, the flight was realized according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and to the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions to the take-off, and to the rate and has measures that the aircraft advanced towards the bordering zone between DF and the State of Mexico there was of the put to bed nebulosity to weak height.
Selected roads:
It is probable qu" because of the nebulosity conditions the crew looked for a zone of weaker height and more of visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impacte.
The coordinated impacte and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impacte it did not there have or loss of the check or deterioration of the trajectory of flight.
Dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
Available information so far allows supposing that the impacte took place on an upright and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remainders of the aircraft allows supposing that the helicopter collided with itself the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
One did not detect tracks of fire or of explosion:
In the place of the sinister one it does not always have any track in the remainders of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiples contacts with the ground.
During the land works one found pieces of the aircraft to a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presented a slope that goes since seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it possibly dislocated himself to alongside his trip.
Information furnishes elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter can have had multiple impactes with the ground.
After the meticulous research in an ampler zone than the encircled place, around the accident, one did not find pieces disperse aircraft, which bears the presumption of that impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social assurance directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of the children and young; this is borne by specialists of the IPN
The Mexican institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it directs an investigation to discover the gene of the obesity in the case of children and young, called protocol 'Genetic of the obesity of the children and adolescent' that will allow having the associated markers to the surpoids.
In a communiqué, the boss of the Unity of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20E Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one had formed a team multidisciplinaire of doctors, nurses, nutritionnistes and attend social.
This team is supported by specialists and students of third cycle of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and Center of Investigation and of Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) Institute Polytechnique National (IPN).
To the investigation one invites to participate the population having or non-right, to present itself to participating athletic unities of the IMSS to Valle of México, where carry out themselves the proofs to the minors all the Saturdays from 8:00 hours.
It underlined that the protocol began in Athletic Unity Cuauhtémoc (Estado of México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity unfolds itself in Athletic Unity of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado of México Orients).
After attaining the objective combining 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Athletic Unity Independencia (to the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Athletic Unity Morelos (to the north of Distrito Federal).
It explained that the objective of this investigation and the one e connaitre the components and the importance of the genetic one in the matter of the development of obesity and to identify with the children and Mexican young factors of risk to warn the appearance of the chronic degenerative diseases.
As one will celebrate November 14 the World-wide Day of the Diabeteses, it mentioned that the objective is the one to combine three thousand children and young between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to the nutrition.
They also will be asked on their physical activity and their antecedents of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid the risk factors that release affections as the diabetes or the kidney insufficiency.
It detailed that the Saturdays one will apply to all the participants of the anthropometric mesurages (weight, cuts, circumference of the size), blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycérides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one tries identify the associated people to infantile obesity).
Cruz López signaled that this investigation is the fruit of the preoccupation of the professionals of the health for the alarming one taken of weight in the case of the minors.
'The investigations of health of 1999 and 2006 signaled that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of the boys, of the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of the girls of the 47 percent; in the matter of the surpoids one observed also a dramatic increase', underlined the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated that the justification for the research of the markers is based in the Fact that the population of the country is different of the others by his genetic history.
It informed that in average, the Mexican ones have a 65 percent of heredity indo-américaine, a 30 European percent and a five African percent and this condition reflects itself in the associated people to the diabeteses and surpoids.
It explained that usually, the genetic one of obesity translates itself in the inability of bruler the excess of energy that one consumes (calories), that deposits itself under the grease form.
The researcher explained that the direct profit for the participants this is the complete evaluation of the children, which allows detecting if they present a degree of surpoids or of obesity.
Ila said same that the presence of the pleats of dark color (acanthosis) on the neck and the forearm indicate the probability to suffer from metabolic deteriorations and even pré-diabètes.
Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors put back it in writing to the parents, to which ones one explains each of the measures and changes in the life style that they must realize to warn the diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three principal components that cause surpoids, obesity and of other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, that is the daily physical activity lack, remain most of the day sit in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead of going on foot on short distances.
Another causes is the high calorie provision, that is to say the biggest consumption of sweetened drinks, moisturize carbon (tamales - meat pâté to the flour of enveloped corn in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a contained top of grease and proteins and the genetic analyzed one in this protocol.
Blacktops it UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops of the blacktop modified with polymères to produce a mixture with a better yield, regardless environmental conditions and of temperature
If the signal that the paved were resolved, it would be no longer necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrant every season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle of México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) UNAM, that assured that if the process of construction and discussion of the paved bitumineux is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his lecture A technological opinion on the blackcurrants, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it announced that the laboratory of which it is responsible develops of the blacktop modified with polymères to produce a mixture having similar characteristics to the one of blacktops it, but with a mechanical resistance bigger, so to high as low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of blacktop modified could be used in places in which these the climate is extremely hot, as certain cities of the north of the country, to improve the yield, and consequently, the formation of the blackcurrants.
It explained that blacktops it, the heavier party of the oil, is a body of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, that together give to the paved his characteristic behavior viscoélastique.
The behavior viscoélastique of blacktops it consists in the Fact that to high temperatures, closely of 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, to 120 degrees C his viscosity is very big and to 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while to very low temperatures, blacktops it becomes breaking, it added.
That means that in the streets the resistance of blacktops it is not uniform and modifies itself during the day according to the environmental conditions and of temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad of México in their majority were covered by a paved flexible one, composed from six put to bed materials, of which the three last ones imply blacktops it.
Between the put to bed more superficial is located the layer of blacktops, formed by of small bathed rocks in blacktops and compactées later.
Each of the small rocks that forms the layer, it signaled, is bathed year blacktops.
When the there past vehicles while generating efforts, this one allows that the forces propagate themselves very well in the paved.
If one had of blacktops it modified, these would propagate themselves better, agreed the chemical engineer.
On the layer of blacktops, he says, one puts a last layer called puts to bed rumble, done in fine rock, that is to say, sand that also is bathed in blacktops.
As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, she must have more mechanical force than the layer of blacktops and furnish adherence in the street.
Having left it the paved that receives and distributes the efforts, the rumble layer demands as as this one has an adequate thickness and the material of which she is done must be cared for.
The climate, specially humidity and the temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, specially water, he says, for these considerably affect the yield of the layer of blacktops.
When the ground wets itself, water sheds itself inside the layer is it is difficult that this one sort, which soft all the put to bed of the paved and consequently cause of the blackcurrants.
In the process of formation of a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that ruins itself is the film of rumble and only later is affected the layer of blacktops, but the damage does not have place immediately, but it is a process that must be cared for to the first signals with adequate programs of discussion.
The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and consequently the thickness of every layer of the always paved must be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee his satisfaction, to avoid the formation frequents blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is again a lot to investiguer and work on blacktops it, for example, the emulsions bitumineuses, that in of other countries already exist on the market and allow repairing the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What lacked to the candidate of Valle to be the new miss Colombia?
Analyze factors that did that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain the crown of miss Colombia.
Valle receives his title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to satisfy itself with the fact to find itself on the podium of the winning ones, carry the crown of money and the band that accredits it as new princess of Colombia.
With the obtained result last night to Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico brought up with the crown and the scepter, the department sum already 14 titles of Princess and Melina itself one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca that were located close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which ones Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Pink Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), White Leila (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that a lot of people puts itself is:
What did it lack? Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite one that in every presentation showed that she had it all to be the new Miss Colombia, for she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Better Face Pretty of Fashion, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro that took themselves the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first considered factor key in the decision taken by the juror to designate it First Princess is the Fact that she did not convince with his response to the question "? Which was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here the response of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of itself culturaliser, definitively I believe that the book that marked my childhood is" The small prince", this is a book rather deep.
At present I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called "THE fervor of the blood"".
This response did not please first of all because of the term "itself culturaliser" and deuxièmement concretely in order not to explain which manner every quoted book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read please a little, "The small prince" is a big book"
Between the launched hypotheses there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being preferred it, applauded it and the candidate that received all the preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the better hand-crafted suit, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and it is for that that she did not shine on the scene".
And one noted that in his first presentation in bath shirt to the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the day before coronation.
Even if to the two parades she had appeared sure of herself, one noted that she did not have the force and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como put some" (As to the house), Canal RCN declared that the Fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the Fact that the candidate that obtains most of the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
Of more, Valle avoided the press to the end, and that was an error.
Another hypothesis it is that Valle did not succeed convincing the jury on his interest for the social initiatives, that is in fact the gasoline of the National Competition of Beauty.
It is for that that two days before the election sworn it international Lucy Doughty declared that they looked for an engaged woman in the matter of the social necessities of his country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient with a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look at beyond the physics and to center itself on his social sensitiveness, that before beginning the Competition already are implied in projects", she explained.
One speculates as as Valle sinned by its defects of his behind and the fibrosis that observed itself in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, for precisely the jury elected it as the candidate 'natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and physical work person in charge.
The assistant of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco reconnait that Melina did not have the better body, that it in there had better, "but his fibrosis problem on the abdomen, that in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions that she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle did not know to do them.
His body was never his trump and she lost because of this aspect".
For this price, that the National Competition of Beauty puts back for the first time, after the parade in bath shirt has arises a cruel prediction that accomplished itself last night, one said that that was a small gift that Raymundo did to Melina for not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, a position that gives him the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the competition international by designation of the National Competition.
Nevertheless, she will pass in the history as one of the queens that in spite of his dazzling passage by Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Was thus the work of the person of Cali that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali is passed to the history as the man that confirmed the death of" Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The passed November 4 a dactyloscopiste of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the person that confirmed the identity of the supreme boss of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", while confronting its fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes that work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability 'of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada that works for 21 years in the domain of judicial investigation.
At first of his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where a lot of times it had to pass more than five days in the forest to arrive to the place in which were located the corpses qu had to be identified.
The year 2000 it did himself transferred to the capital of Valle and after having follows by the adequate courses, it specialized himself in dactyloscopie, that is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say the palms and the feet.
During the week of the operation against aka Alfonso Cano one had warned to Eliazar to take with him of the clothes at least for three days.
Something of very big one awaited it.
Friday the night it left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
It knew that it had to identify two corpses and that one suspected that one of them was the one of the man that directed the OLDER guérrilla of the world, consequently one asked him to take itself the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
But when it arrived with the investigation team to the place of the corpse, it did not recognize it by his physical aspect, for this one was very different of the one that it had seen in the media.
It did not have any beard, it was dressed as a peasant of the zone, without glasses and a lot leaner one.
But the impressions do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the one of the card.
His eye did not cheat it: it was a matter of" Alfonso Cano".
This same night, the native man of Puerto Tejada was the person in charge that confirmed to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was a matter of the supreme boss of the Farc.
To the research of the impression
For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manual Santos did to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people of connait not our work.
The dactyloscopie is an exact science, without error margin, that can be crucial in the crime resolution.
From to identify the corpses, the supported dactyloscopistes the investigations for the offences as the flight and the homicide and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When are captured, a lot of delinquent present false cards of identity or do not have any documents.
We take their fingerprints and the look for in the data basis.
The researcher told that in a flight case it had to remove a part of wall of a house, for in this place the thief had supported his hand to let a safe go out a lot of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult for they are not any adequate areas to draw from it a fingerprint, but in this case were able to obtain us the impression of the very hand and identify to the delinquent one that had participated in different flights", it remembers.
The impressions also can separate or confirm suspicious in cases of homicide.
Recently one found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
By intermède of the investigation one determined that a parent can be suspicious of the crime and in fact an impression on the bottle coincided.
Even if that no guarantees not that it is the assassin, that places it on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopiste of the CTI explained that one extracts "the fingerprints of the objects with of the reactive chemical one or physical".
When they appear, one uses a préleveur or a band to remove them.
Posterior, the impressions are sent to Asif, the basis of data of the déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there is again a lot of Colombian without papers", indicated the expert of the CTI.
It explained that all is not how one shows in the program of television CSI.
As all that shines is not any now, all that one touches does not become forcement an impression.
She nevertheless can be used, if one realizes the necessary confrontation.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities to New York
Hundreds of show jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti for there to camp.
A big party of the people attained the order of discharge and moved itself to a park neighbor.
The integrating movement Occupies Wall Street challenged this Tuesday the authorities of New York while trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from which they were evacuated to the dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of show jostled themselves in front of the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to attain thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the somewhere else movement replied to the discharge while occupying a park more to the north of the city, where there were again stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will install ourselves in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through of sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", says one of the spokespersons of the movement "Occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignant' to the dictated discharge of their camp personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived until the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings emitted an order that forbade the forced discharge of the place and allowed the showing to remain in the camp.
Of more, the 'indignant' occupied a new situated park to the confluence of the central Canals Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close of the entry to the tunnel Holland, that unites New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they succeeded occupying the place, but after the Police itself there moved and stopped some showing ones, even if Bray was not able to confirm the concrete figure, while assuring Efe on account of the fact that it saw some journalists to which ones one also had passed handcuffs.
The organization assures that there is centennial of people that had installed themselves in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved himself in support sign to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them in front of the Police.
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - that is a pregnant one of private property - remains closed while awaiting the judicial celebration of an audience foreseen by this Tuesday during which one must analyze the legality of the discharge of this morning.
Some showing moved ones even there carried and distributed to that hour of the copies of this judicial order and they delivered it even to the agents that oversaw the place, which caused 'certain small clashes', indicated Bray, that denounced certain official the Fact that hit showing them.
The judicial order forbids to the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupies Wall Street or to apply of the 'published laws after the beginning of the occupation or to forbid to the showing to attain again to the park with of the stretched or of other property that they used beforehand'.
The mayor Bloomberg indicated in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the showing, to which ones it nevertheless warned on account of the fact that the local laws do not allow them to install itself with of the stretched and bags to sleep.
The municipal counselor defended personally the realized discharge to the dawn to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which one stopped 200 people and that was decided because of the Fact that the showing 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that it had given the order to evacuate the place because this one became "a place in which them no one came to protest, but to violate the laws and in certain cases, to do harm to other people", for "certain stores had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their life quality".
"The discharge of this morning to the dawn was repugnant and shows that to the bottom Bloomberg is more been very interested in to defend the financial interests than those of the American workers", added the Spokesperson of the movement, that accused the mayor of "not to respect expression liberty".
The people in charge of "Occupies Wall Street" indicated as as they do not think to organize of "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with the community organizations and the unions to commemorate the two months of protest, that began September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Mary Virgin in a program of special television of Noel
To quotation of Michael Bublé and of Canadian others celebrate, she go out in the television program "It's has Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was attending it Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", first-aid worker in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", marries musician of rock Tommy It and now, the actress and models will be the Mary Virgin in a special program of Noel of the Canadian television.
The private canal of television CTV announced today that Anderson, to quotation of the "crooner" (strolling player) Michael Bublé and of Canadian others celebrate, go out in the television program "It's has Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1 interpreting a very special Mary Virgin.
CTV distributed today pictures of the program of television in which these Anderson, known also for the ample broadcasting on Internet of a video private pornographique in which she appeared with his spouse from this time there, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy It, dressed apparait as the Mary Virgin while supporting in a stays a doll that represents to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of origin indian that presented recently a part of "Violent My Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, apparait come Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel of CTV presents also the Canadian singer Bublé, that at the end of March married to Buenos Areas models it Argentina Luisana Lopilato, and that is itself not far of controversies.
Recently, Bublé called 'whore' the American Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts to New York.
Japan renait after the earthquake
The PIB raises a 1.5% thanks to the consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of decrease of the beginning of March
Since the months of March the Japanese economy found itself paralyzed, convalescent again after the devastating earthquake that became nuclear crisis, the worse catastrophe of the Japanese country since the Second World War.
The first estimations of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, in spite of the difficult world-wide context, seems to have lessened.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Crude Internal Product between July and September served to turn definitively the page: the PIB raised a 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% in made annual rate.
The one recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - supposes, what's more, the biggest rhythm of increase since the period of January to March 2010.
The recuperation explains, partially, by the return of the acquisitions of equipment to restore the zones devastated by the earthquake and the posterior tsunami.
Of fact, the businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, by report downwards of the 0.9% of the expenditures of observed capital of January to March, the first decline after six months of not increase interrupted.
Nevertheless, the true one stimulate Japanese economy does not base itself exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or to rebuild - infrastructures, to use the lacks for croitre of zero.
Japan awakened especially thanks to the evolution of the consumption domesticates, that currently represents the 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variable raised a 1%, pushed by the increase of the expenditures on vehicles, travel and recreation activities.
The scar of the yen
Tokyo put back itself to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese change - became one of the "values refuge" elected by the investors that flee the crisis of the debt in Eurozone and the disturbances anticipations of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a flagstone in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With one divides stronger, the products are dearer abroad, a serious back for a country of which the line of economical flottement is determined by the health of the big technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, did responsible of their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of E.U., the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
"It is necessary to follow the risks that persist, as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the quick assessment of the yen", signaled yesterday the secretary of state for Economical Political, Motohisa Furukawa.
And effectively, the perspectives not at all are encouraging.
The organization for Cooperation and Economical Development (OCDE) mentioned that the majority of the member nations presented in September of the clearer signals of economical slowdown.
The informer that anticipates the points of modulation of the world-wide economy put in relief that the principal ones be able are braked.
For this one lowered four decimals until 100.4 points, in comparison with 100.8 in aout.
Eurozone even was underneath average, that is located in the level 100, lowering n eight decimals until 99.13 points.
Athens supplies again the doubts
Said Papadimos that adjustments will be approved, but the conservative ones will not sign any written engagement
With the peripheral released risk premiums and the resettled uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues get tangled up in the labyrinth that drives to the go out of the big crisis of the European debt.
The sensation of that the "consensus" new Government of transition hellène rather is imposed by the requirements of Brussels that by a real conviction of the political forces begins being confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos signaled yesterday that there is not of alternate one for reform them structural and that the period of hundred days establishes in his designation will be can be runs to apply them, the leader on the part New conservative Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it was not going to support the new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated his requirement of new elections for foreseen date, the one Of February 19.
"The principal task of this Government is the one to apply the decisions of the summit of October 26", declared Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will finish tomorrow with a confidence vote for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate the job, reforms it disciplinary code of the officials and new measures against the fiscal escape will be the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras no releases the doubts on his position: "We were involved ourselves to help the transition Government, but we were not involved ourselves to anything of more".
The leader conservatif went a step further in his pulse that E.U. and IMF, the organisms that must unblock the 8,000 million that Athens necessitates with urgency, and said clearly that it will not approve any letter of engagement of realization of adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated again by the impacte provoked by the avenue all of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not unblock the assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the principal ones leave hellènes sign "an engagement writes without ambigüités as early as possible".
The Spokesperson of the Economical Matters, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth slice" of 8,000 million, even if it does not have a not final date more.
The Greeks have again a lot to do.
The Queen Sofía: "This are instruments for the progress and the hope"
The Queen underlines the place "preponderant" Spain in the matter of this finance type
Spain "attained a preponderant place at the world-wide level in the role of the Microphones Finance".
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country became in these two last decades the second giver of the planet in the matter of this cooperation instrument of which "the gasoline" lies in the Fact that this one is an "instrument for the social progress, justice and the hope in a future better for any humanity, based on the confidence in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the v-e Summit World-wide of the Microcrédit to Valladolid with the certainty that" there is not doubt" that this operation type are "absolutely essential" to attain the Objectives of the Millennium establish by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specially, in the one that has as goal the reduction to the half of the volume of the people that live with income under a dollar a day, to which one Is set up it "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to enlarge the network of profitable ones "in all the corners of the planet, and assumes this task with" responsibility", signaled the Queen Sofía, that hoped that the initiatives and the provisions origins during the Summit, that will extend itself to Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and timeliness better for poorest and especially for the women", the profitable principal ones of these ready ones.
We have "attains a lot of objectives" and "we are done facing a lot of challenges".
The Summit of the Microcrédit is envisioned not only as a debate for, but also as the plateforme has to leave of which ones it is necessary impulser "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the objective is that at the end of 2015 there is 175 millions of poor families that attained these financial services and that hundred millions of these families go out of the poverty threshold in which they live now.
The impulse in the conception of the microcrédits in Spain and in the remainder of the world "followed the initiated path there are some years of a manner pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, underlined the Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealistic in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she connait since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh for connaitre in the field his ready politics of.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World-wide Summit to Washington and of others meet as those celebrated to the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "to every encounter I was able to note an evolution continues", explained His Majesty, of which the relation with this project brought him yesterday the qualifier of "family boss" met to Valladolid from the "fork over poor".
Finally, the Queen Sofía finished his intervention while encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and in the solution research to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Imperative étique"
The minister of the Exterior Matters, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an imperative étique" for any democratic State.
In this direction, she exposed that this would be an error of vinculer the cooperation with countries in the process of development to eras of economical prosperity, for this one is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that the microcrédits suppose "a serious political and severe dedicated one to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed nations must work under criteria of solidarity and not to leave that this one is the victim of the compressions.
For Spain, the microcrédit is "one of the principal lines of cooperation for the development".
The secretary of state for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "confidence" to the people "excluded to which ones all farms the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of Fastened it, wished the welcome to the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the united spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president to the universal vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Union democrat (CDU), Monday November 14, to Leipzig, unfolded itself without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president on the part Christian democrat.
The future of Europe initially was not foreseen to the program but imposed on the fall, notably to satisfy the campaigning that judge politics of the too lax government with respect to the Greeks today and maybe Italians tomorrow.
The proposal on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted to the almost unanimity.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which had right, to the coming from their interventions, Angela Merkel then, some hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile minister of the finances, did not leave places to the doubt.
The principal idea of the chancellor - and proposal - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but of Europe".
Not only because Europe, this is peace but because "nine millions of jobs depend directly of the Euro".
For the chancellor, "the time came from a breakthrough in Europe".
That could translate itself by modifications to the treaty of allowing Lisbon to reinforce the check of the European Union on the political budget one countries of the Euro zone, but that could equally lead to the election of the president of the European Commission to the universal vote "in order to give a face to Europe".
Such is in any case the one of the suggestions of the proposal adopted by the congress of which the instigator clearly is Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is not very probable that the Twenty-seven agree quickly on this revolution: the Great Britain there is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy it east equally.
But the stake is put.
All the same, the delegates rejected to one crushing majority the suggestion to balance the each country weight to the board of directors of the European central Bank according to the weight of every economy, which evidently came back to to reinforce the weight of Germany.
Concerned to appease the climate inside his party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl But she not not did more try win his congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in prompt difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the proposal on Europe consecrates a paragraph to the importance of "German French friendship", Angela Merkel did not evoke France.
Safe in hollow.
While recalling that there are two centuries, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
Of fact, this was the one of the more humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does represent the fraud to the stops disease?
After benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the stops disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday November 15 to Bordeaux to visit a cash register of family benefits, and to pronounce a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - fight against the social frauds and the assistanat.
And to accompany this offensive, that leaves a will to save money in a harshness context, but is not less warning of an axis of the presidential campaign to right, the majority wants to concentrate on the stops disease.
First in a goal of budget economies: the government envisions to impose on the employees of the deprived a fourth day of lack before the taken in charge of a work stop.
In clear, without agreement of specific business, an employee that falls sick would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks giving rise to anger, but that would allow retrieving 280 million Euros, according to The Echos.
And that would be accompanied of another measures, of more symbolic reach: to impose on the officials a day of non compensated lack in case of work stop (they do not have so far any delay of lack, against three days in the deprived).
While these questions are in discussion, the majority restarts equally the thematic one of the frauds, targeting this time the abuses linked to the work stops.
"The checks will be a lot more important ones and, what's more, if you took, you will reimburse", warned Xavier Bertrand to the microphone of RTL, Sunday November 13.
As for other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the frauds to the work stops.
This one does in fact the object since 2002 of a followed constant one and of political offensives, that most often bore fruit.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's delay first on the national figures.
According to the national cash Register of disease insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were delivered in 2006.
According to the Institute of research and of documentation in economy of health, the daily compensation represented in 2008 5% of the expenditures of health, with 11.3 billion Euros.
On this sum, 46% concerned the vacations maternity and accidents of the work, and 54% concerned the stops disease, is 6.2 billion Euros.
And therefore 2.5% of the expenditures of health.
In 2010, the French knew in average 14.5 days of stop of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.
An average that hides certain gaps: another investigates, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees questioned said not to have taken any day of stop disease.
Another study, this time disease insurance, precise that in 2010, 37% of the stops disease were of an inferior length to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a months, 15% of a to three months and 11% beyond.
When one compares them with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere to the work stops.
A long conducted study in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence (for reasons of health or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% to Denmark, 15% to the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% to the Netherlands.
The fraud to the stops disease represents very little facing the moonlighting.
As for the fraud, she attains only a weak extent.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 does that the checks are systematic on the stops disease of more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1.5 millions of checks, the CNAM noted that 13% of the 285 000 realized ones for short-lived stops were "unjustified or too long", is 37 050 cases.
In the case of the stops of more than 45 days, systematically checked, one counted 11% of case "misfit or unjustified" on 1.2 million, is 132 000.
Altogether, therefore 169 000 cases "unjustified", on several millions of employees having had a stop disease.
A figure that represents well little face, for example, to the one of the moonlighting.
According to the representative UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the question in June, this one would represent 9 to 15 billion Euros of lack to win fiscal per year, is more than the total cost of the daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new program of adjustment to rectify his economy.
It is what declared Monday November 14 the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, in front of the Parliament, adding that the cents days given to his union government would not suffice to accomplish this task.
"To follow the efforts of turnaround of the economy, we need the European support of our partners and of a new program of budget adjustment", declared the government leader, that pronounced his first public speech to the opening of the debate on the confidence vote to the Parliament Wednesday.
The implement taken decisions at the time of the summit of the Euro zone October 27 will be the "principal task" new government, for the participation of the country to the Euro zone "is in game", it added.
Consequently, Mr. Papadémos foresaw that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "to the surroundings of 9%" PIB of here the end of the year, after being of 10.6% in 2010 and of 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, brought Monday its support for the already approved measures to attempt go out of the crisis of the debt but warned that his party would not be involved itself on an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures", it said at the time of a meeting with the representatives on his part, New Democracy.
It was said agreed with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and debt, and of fight against the wastes but hostile to all political one that would prevent the economical return.
To Olli Rehn, the European commissioner loaded economical and monetary matters that warned that the IMF and THE E.U. would not unblock the ready one of 8 necessary billion Euros without written guarantee of all the parties that they would support the foreseen measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word sufficed and that it would sign nothing under exterior pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and the attended suicide, says a committee of experts
The Canadians live in the denial of the death, according to the report of the Royal Corporation of Canada
Regarding cares palliative, the committee claims that the governments, the health care institutions, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative cares, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian corporation lives in the denial of the death.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept in fact to speak with their doctor of the conditions in which ones they want to die and take disposals to this effect.
This is the one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Corporation of Canada, to which one participated six experts linked to various domains, of which ethics, the right and medicine.
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal Code in a manner to allow the attended suicide and euthanasia, when this choice imposes, with a competent judged patient to take such a decision.
Of entry of game, the experts quote a recent investigation of the Economist Intelligence Unites, that compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada itself there classified 10E, the study notes that "the médicalisation of the death to Canada generated a culture in which the people are afraid of to approach the subject of the death".
Médicalisation or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative cares, we retrieve the experts authorized by the Royal Corporation of Canada.
And despite the wish that have most of the Canadians to die to the house, 68.6% of them end up to die to the hospital.
As a whole, country, it is at the Quebec that this rate is the highest one, with 86% of the deaths arising to the hospital.
On the delicate question of euthanasia and attended suicide, the authors of the report arrive to conclusions that go in opposition to the position of the federal government, that already said to want nothing to change to the criminal Code concerning euthanasia and the attended suicide.
Now, according to the experts, that equally reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or décriminalisées, there is not any proof that this induced decriminalization of the abuses in the application, that is to say the practice of euthanasia or attended suicide on of the non competent people or not consenting.
On the contrary, asserted yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, one would rediscover more numerous case of these floods precisely in the countries where euthanasia and the attended suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced to Canada, where she is clearly illegal".
"The attended suicide is practiced to Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Let's recall that 85% of the Canadians already pronounced themselves in favor of euthanasia because they believe that she would allow the people in end of life to reduce their sufferings, according to a poll Angus Reid carried out in 2010.
And 66% swellings that the fact to legalize euthanasia will not have for effect to send the message that the life of the elderly or handicapped people has less than value.
As for the people having practiced the attended suicide, the probes estimate to 41% that they should not be followed.
Regarding maintenance or of suspension of the cares with a patient, the position is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the criminal Code that the collection of the cares for which there was a refusal legally validates is not criminal.
The committee of required experts as as the professionals of health are formed to the duty to respect a refusal of the cares in life end, without being afraid of the criminal pursuits.
Regarding cares palliative, the committee claims that the governments, the health care institutions, and the doctors work together to assure better palliative cares, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
At last, regarding sedation palliative or final, already widely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the required committee that she is considered, when she does not serve to reduce the physical pain, as euthanasia, and that she is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Certain experts in the domain of the right of health already emitted reserves concerning the conclusions of the report of the experts of the royal Corporation of Canada.
Me Rock Deschamps, specialist in right of health, qualified of" extreme" the position of the signatory experts of the report, among others things because she not limit the practice of the euthanasia to the patients in final phase.
"That opens the door to a position where all an each that would be tired from life and that would have more than 18 years could ask this than one helps it to commit suicide", says Me Deschamps, that had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Me Deschamps underlines as as the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in social fabric of the corporation.
Now, "in corporation, he says, there are beacons and constraints".
The specialist of the right of health Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, that she qualified of "shows pro euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, that is itself member of the Royal Corporation of Canada, protests in particular the data of the report as for the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and the attended suicide are legalized, is at the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Damask denounces a "plot"
The Syria is more and more isolated

"If Bachar had at heart the interest of his country, it should resign, but it also should create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", said the king of Jordan, country neighbor of the Syria, in an interview to the BBC.
For its part, the boss of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored that the efforts of Turkish mediation undertake since the beginning of the year with the Syrian system sold themselves by a failure.
"Those that are not in peace to the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave", it declared, referring to the Syria, country neighbor to consideration of which Turkey adopts a line more and more length.
The United States are themselves of their congratulated sides of a "reinforcement of the consensus against Assad and the schemes of the system" Syrian, after the decisions of the Arabic League and European Union.
"The international community, the United States, THE E.U., the Arabic League, countries as Turkey adopt a more and more hard tone" facing the oppression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the department of State.
During this time, 16 civil ones and at least 19 members of the forces of the system perisies in the region of Deraa, in the south of the Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory of the human rights (OSDH).
Two civil others perisies "at the time of exchanges of shooting and of pounding to the heavy machine guns to Jobar" in the city besieged Homs, according to this NGO.
At the time of a press conference, the Syrian minister of the foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem nevertheless considered that the country itself "directed towards the end of the crisis".
It has besides sharply reacted to the decision of the Arabic League to suspend Damask of its works, that constitutes according to him "a dangerous step".
The Syria "will not bend", it added, assuring that "the plots weave against the Syria will fail".
After his decision to suspend the Syria, the Arabic League studies at present a "mechanism of protection of the civil ones" and wishes the sending of 500 members of Arabic organizations of the rights of the person, of media and military observers in the country.
The French minister of the foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said itself in favor of the sending of observers of the UN to help to protect the civil ones of the oppression of the system that according to him confines itself in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is foreseen tomorrow to Flap to take stock of the implement plan of go out of crisis decided November 2 and provident notably the collection of the armed forces of the cities in prey to the dispute and the liberation of the showing stopped.
The Russian minister of the foreign Affairs, Sergueï Lavrov, judged yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arabic League, while China urged the Syria to implement the plan of go out of crisis, while being careful not to support eventual penalties against Damask.
Italy
Required Monti of the time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future government leader Italian, Mario Monti, claimed a little time to the markets to form his team and to implement a program, that will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the government Berlusconi.
The European former commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and the employers.
It should set up an office comparatively restricts composed from exterior technocrates to the Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, representative of one of the small numerous parliamentary groups engaged in discussions, after meeting the president of the designated Counsel.
The president of the Room of the representatives, Finished Gianfranco, for its part said to expect that Mario Monti solicits of here to Friday a vote of confidence to the Parliament to assure itself that the new government has access to a sufficient support.
The consultations will finish by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list, doubtless of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock market and bond markets yesterday, while their request of the time.
In "democracy, there are precise delays" to prepare a government and his program, it underlined, being said "certain that the markets will be patient and will understand".
His designation by the president initially had been greeted by the markets, but the worry resumed the over notably after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in Euro zone in September.
The designated Prime Minister should constitute an understanding team especially of the technocrates, even if it underlined that it would like there to include of the "political".
The new government must last up to 2013, dates back to the next legislatures, it estimated.
According to the president of the Room of the representatives, Finished Gianfranco, the new government will obtain the confidence of the Parliament of here Friday.
Mr. Monti was involved itself, once take office, to work in the urgency and in the goal that Italy "returns to normalcy protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of the European commissioner Olli Rehn underlined that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change".
THE E.U., convinced that Rome will not attain his objective of budget balance in 2013 despite the adopted plans of austerity the latter months, asked notably new measures of harshness.
The "patronizes employers" Italians Emma Marcegaglia, that will see it Tuesday, insisted also on the necessity to restart the economy, "for a country that does not have any growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and his independence as European commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "era change" for the Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of the serious one" and an "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown one will be the longevity of his team.
The president Napolitano would want to avoid early elections, for Italy must place here April 2012 for 200 billion Euros of obligations of State.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped the Iran to develop a usable trigger with a nuclear weapon, asserted Monday an American NGO specialized in the atomic risk.
The institute for the science and the international security (ISIS) bases on the recent report of the international Agency for the atomic security (AIEA) and of other documents emanating of this agency of the UN to identify this researcher.
The AIEA did leaves last week of its "serious worries" as for a "possible military dimension" Iranian nuclear program.
According to drawing ISIS widely in documents of the AIEA, Mr. Danilenko, been born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the years 60 in a nuclear center Soviet military officer to Tcheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been implied in the diamond factory synthetic by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to establish a producing business of the "nano-diamants" to Kiev.
Economical difficulties of his corporation would have driven it to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
It next would have cooperated to the Iranian program of 1996 to 2002, before his return in Russia.
In his last report, the AIEA evokes "of strong indications that the development by the Iran" of a system of nuclear detonation "was helped by the foreign work of an expert, that not only knew well this technique, but that, as a State member informed the Agency, worked during the bulk of his career on this technology within the nuclear program military officer of his country of origin".
The crimes and anti-moslem offences increased of 50%
The crimes and offences against the Moslems increased closely of 50% of 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, the other racial and religious violence lowered or not very progressed, according to the statistics of the FBI render public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of the perpetrated violence against the Moslems is passed of 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, is 49% of increase, against a progression of 13% of the violence against the Catholics, a decrease of 4% of the offences against the Jews and a global increase of 14% of the crimes and antireligious offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" very lightly increased to 6 628 cases, of which 47.3% motivated ones by differences of race and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is perturbing to see these crimes and offences to increase again", underlined the organization of the human rights Human rights First, "the increase of the violence antimusulmanes is particularly significant", added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First a long time underlined that the violence against the Moslems, as well as all the forms of hate-filled crimes, must be considered as one engraves violation of the human rights", adds one of the people in charge of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to attack itself to these abuses", it adds, considering that that could go through an improvement of the reports of police on the "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the American federal right is an inheritance of the era of the fight for the civic rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence linked to the race, the color of the skin, the religion, the origin and now sexual membership.
Twitter modifies his plateforme and resembles more to Facebook
The site of microphone blogging Twitter introduced Monday of the changes in the presentation of his plateforme, to allow notably to its users to observe the activity of those that they follow, which does to resemble his service a little more to the one of Facebook.
A new onglet "activity" and another "name" allow following more legibly, live the activity of the others "Twittos", the netsurfers of which one follows the messages ("tweets") and those that follow you.
That allows knowledge if they do to follow by the messages, if they subscribe themselves to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new formula of Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the body of the network Monday, indicated to the AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.

Austria
inscription of a "rule of now" budget in the constitution
The government of big coalition social-démocrate/démocrate-chrétien in power in Austria decided Tuesday be in line with the constitution a "rule of now" budget in order to reduce the public deficits and thus to avoid an eventual degradation by the credit agencies of the sovereign grade of Austria (triple A).
It is the social chancellor democrat Werner Faymann that even announced him this decision to the coming from a counsel of the ministers, while the Austrian public debt is of 74.6%, widely above the criterion of 60% maximum fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht, but clearly underneath the country debts as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the creditworthiness of Austria was lowered only of a single notch, of AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion Euros of interests what's more each year", argued the vice chancellor and christian democrat minister of the foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria gives thus after a request of the summit to Brussels of the member nations of the Euro zone of October 26 last one: the bosses of State and of government then had claimed the here inscription at the end of 2012 reduction of the public deficits and of a return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or in a law of same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government comes close to itself the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt a such "rule".
Of here 2017, the structural public deficit will have to diminish each year of 0.75% of the crude internal Product (PIB) and, to count of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal Government will not have to surpass each year 0.35% of the PIB, while the regional States as well as the towns will have to present budgets to the balance.
The objective is to do to pass to the horizon 2020/21 the public debt under the criterion of 60% fixed one by the Treaty of Maastricht.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens of a new intervention on the market of the change
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again on the market of the change if the yen had to continue climb.
"We will intervene as we did it the last time if we note an excessive volatility" in the rate of change of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen climbed back up not far from the historic levels that pushed Japanese authorities to intervene October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yens against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese motto that had just established a new record of vigor since 1945 facing the green ticket.
But the yen uniformly is climbed back up since, doped by purchases of investors that consider it as a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of world-wide economical slowdown and of crisis of debt in Europe.
The dollar is ironed Tuesday under the 77 yens and the Euro brought down under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, nearby levels having released the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yens and the more than 160 Euro yens.
This flare-up of the Japanese motto night to the exportations of the archipelago for she increases the cost of the products Made in Japan and reduced the value of pulled income of the foreigner by the Japanese firms, when they convert them in national change.
"Japan fights to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and the March 11 tsunami that devastated the region of the Tohoku (northeastern), underlined Mr. Noda that fears that this renchérissement of the yen does not kill in the egg the fragile return.
The third world-wide economical power renewed with the growth to the third quarter -1.5% in comparison with the preceding quarter- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebond of the exportations and consumption of the households leaden by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister judged that the cherté of the yen did not reflect "the economical basic Japan".
The minister of the Finances, Jun Azumi, for its part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), that opened Tuesday a meeting of two days of his counsel of monetary policy, to take all the possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the assistant governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ already had taken "the fitting measures", giving to understand that no additional monetary softening was to be awaited Wednesday.
At the time of his last fine meeting October, the transmission institute increased of 5,000 billion yens (47 billion Euros) its purchases of vouchers of the Treasure, doing to pass to 55,000 billion yens (519 billion Euros) the ceiling of the amounts that she devote to the various financial title purchases to flood the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the rates climb, the stock Markets crack
The risk of contagion of the crisis of the debt always mines the European indices.
Despite the designation again heads of state in Greece and in Italy and of better figures of growth in France and in Germany, the rates of the weakened countries follow their ascension.
Always worried for the stability of the Euro zone, the European stock Markets sink themselves a little more in negative territory, this Tuesday November 15.
To Paris, to 10H, the CAC 40 loser 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax to Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the yields of the loans of the States of the Euro zone in difficulty, the action markets through the world continue to return a part of their recent gains".
"The investors, nervous, are only too conscious of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker with IG Markets, quoted by the agency Reuters.
The stock Market of Tokyo closed in decrease of 0.7%, suffering to his turn of the renewed fears of the participants of the market on the subject of the capacity of Europe to contain the crisis of the debt.
"Japan, as the remainder of the world, has the fastened eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a corridor of narrow variations as long as the investors will not have proofs that the position is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, managing funds with Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed worries on the future of the Euro zone penalizes the uniform currency, that follows his decrease Tuesday.
The Euro evolves to his lower level since a months and half.
Towards 10H, the European motto is worth 1.3570 dollars, in fold of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she backed up after the party of the chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in congress Monday, adopted a provident proposal notably the possibility for a country in difficulty go out of the Euro zone without for as much to leave the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates beyond 6%
The rates of loan of Italy and Spain remain at very disturbing levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian obligations to 10 years attains 6.85%, the one of the Spanish titles of same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rate of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to supply the fears of the participants.
The boss of the future government Italian Mario Monti claimed from the time to the markets to reestablish the position in Italy, threatened asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has, him, asserted that the implement taken decisions at the time of the summit of the Euro zone October 27 would be the "principal task" of his government.
Spain meet again in the line of gazes at markets, while are held Sunday of the legislative elections in the country.
The rate gap ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years of Germany and Spain attained a new one more historic top.
While waiting for the figures of growth of the Euro zone
Side statistics, France recorded an economical growth of 0.4% to the third quarter, is a little better than the 0.3% awaited, reach by the consumption of the households.
The Insee nevertheless revised downwards the figure of the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of the crude internal Product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth one that worried the more the economists.
Germany, of his side, recorded a growth of 0.5% on the same period.
A first estimation for the body of the Euro zone is awaited to 11H, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energetic political:
the facts must take it on dogmas
If it is a subject that one not can treat from considerations of current term or under the blow of l" emotion, this is well the energetic political.
Availability and the cost of l" influential electricity directly on the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of the businesses.
It is healthy that an electoral appointment is the occasion to reflect to such issues and to the place that there holds nuclear power.
The debate will be fructueux only if it explores the body of the economical, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must be founded their opinion on facts objectives, rational data.
While we are 7 billions d" human beings on the planet, l" demographic evolution will induce a doubly request d" here electricity to 2050, without depriving a huge party of the world-wide population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the rarefaction of the fossil resources to continue to produce l" electricity in permanence, without forgetting the pressing necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas transmissions to fight against the climatic dérèglement, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not modify anything of these parameters.
This is the reason why Germany remains isolated in his decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case or of Belgium, that submits hers to the necessity to be able to find a replacement source able to substitute itself, or Switzerland, that hears just more to construct only central of last generation.
On the other hand, the Great Britain, Finland, the Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for quote only them, follow their projects with determination.
The United States, them, decided after Fukushima to add a unity to their park while resuming the construction of a central one interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, centered on the renewable energies, sometimes is presented as an example, the reality annoys the speech.
The choice of Berlin will translate itself by the renchérissement of the price of l" electricity, an energetic dependance worsened by increased recourse to the imported gas, in particular of Russia, a leap of the transmissions of CARBON DIOXIDE induced by the construction of central ones to the gas and to coal.
In some months, the body of these unfortunate effects do themselves already to feel.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Champion of Europe of l" wind, of which it pulls 30% of his electricity, it is also the one of the biggest users of coal and of gas owing to the intermittence of the wind; by virtue of what, its transmissions of CARBON DIOXIDE and the price of his electricity respectively are 65% and 50% more students than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our political energetic one, our neighbors acquit a bill d" superior electricity of 40% to the one of the French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of l" energy constitutes a factor key of competitiveness and a pledge of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, the French businesses benefit from l" least dear electricity of Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction from nuclear power would generate a strong increase of the price of l" electricity, that would render illusory the beautiful declarations on the réindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.
A price that a wide majority of French refuse themselves to pay, of as much as they do not show any opposition of principle to this energy, the polls show it.
Let's recall that the energetic political one of our country allowed building an industrial system of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs induce.
Strongly exporting, she induces a galaxy of specialized SMES on the international markets and the return very creators of non able to be relocated jobs.
If France came to decide go out of nuclear power, this would be to sacrifice good number of these SMES while reducing as sorrow skin the 6 annual billion Euros of French exportations d" equipments and nuclear services.
Which electrician would order a conceived EPR to work sixty years while the decline of his manufacturer would be programed?
To resolve l" energetic equation, it is necessary to admit that it does not exist any source of production d" electricity miracle, not more than it not some exists of devilish one.
The development by solution Areva not very transmitting of CARBON DIOXIDE, nuclear and renewable, indicates the complementarity of the sources d" energy.
For nuclear power, maintain the highest level of safety is an imperative absolute one.
We have in France an Authority of safety that exercises an intransigent and transparent check on the central existing one as on the work-site of Flamanville.
Our teams, of which professionalism is recognized, are lived same obsession of safety.
In a half century, the nuclear industry knew three accidents engrave.
A single one, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal exploitation; there remained without human or environmental consequence.
To Tchernobyl, the conception of the reactor and human faults impardonnables provoked the drama.
To Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented extent that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will pull the teachings of this accident, as her had done it for the two preceding ones.
Fruit of this gait and of a cooperation between safety authorities, the exploiting and the French and German builders the EPR presents a conception returning it able to withstand of such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the desirous electricians to construct a central one, the stop of his construction to Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offer to the competitors of Areva and EDF while their leash the free way to seize itself leadership in the essential development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the better energetic bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave l" emotion, dogmas and the maneuvers partisanes to dominate a debate so determining for the financial situation, social and financial of our country.
Is the immigration a load or a luck for the economy?
The political regarding immigration conducted one under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under various angles -glut of the services policemen, judicial and administrative subject to politics of the figure, compatibility of this political one with the self-proclaimed statute of "country of the human rights" France.
More recently, it is administrative harassment of which are the subject them foreign students that did the current event, the minister of the Interior (to read May 23 Liberation) proclaiming to the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, of masons and of waiters of restaurant".
But she is only rarely analyzed under the economical angle.
It is that there is on this subject a rather wide consensus between left and upright.
To right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac that declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in an understanding country close to 2 millions of immigrated workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome the very misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided to the left as to right.
For the two edges, the immigrants are perceived as a load for the economy and the French corporation.
The only difference be anxious the degree of generosity that one will deign to grant with respect to the immigrants.
In his program, François Holland restricts itself to triteness, indicating that the codéveloppement will allow resolving our "migratory problem".
This idea of the immigration as a load, a problem, is maybe paying electorally; but she is economically very costly.
As the recall the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthesizing the knowledge more recent on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages.), it exists a wide consensus among the specialists on positive impact of the migratory flows on the economical growth, the salaries and the job in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restrict the immigration weakens the growth and night to the job.
The fears with respect to the impact of the migrant ones are based on the idea that these risk substituting itself to the national workers, all particularly the not very qualified ones, exercising a pressure downwards on their salaries.
But the experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are a lot more supplementary than substitute to the national employees, exercising for the bulk of the trades in sectors in job scarcity.
The immigrants not very qualified work in sectors that do not attract the national employees, and the done more qualify in dynamic sectors in which these the formation does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on the salaries
Same manner that a surgeon will have trouble to work in a country that knows a scarcity of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between national and migrant do that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the job of the national ones.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of the migratory flows induces an understood increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real salaries in the long term.
And this without taking into account the Fact that the variety brought by the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to the economical growth (strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the prices Nobel American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were been founded by immigrants).
The migrant ones are also net contributors of the social systems, in average to height of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The world-wide organization of the work estimates for example that, in Germany, an arriving immigrant at the age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (recipes less spend) of 150000 Euros to the public budgets in average on the body of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of mandate, to be going to look for the lacking points of growth "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, using it to dissuade the immigrants, had the exact inverse effect.
Europe invented the democracy, remains to think the European democracy
The democracy is a precious good; this is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able itself in to remember him that, to have invented it to Athens more than two thousand years ago, knew to alongside the XXe century the tragedies of the Big War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but so French in Spain, Salazar to the Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some were able to believe that it would suffice, for that the democracy prevailed definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it manner more direct that is.
One knows, since Napoléon "the Small one", that it was a matter there of an ease of thought.
The universal vote, to be the necessary condition of the democracy, not some is the sufficient condition and even can be done "oppression instrument" as said formerly the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, the democracy requires well more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a check of the strengths, an education, Lights, economical and social solidarities, a justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is an economical crisis, but she is all as much and first a crisis of the political one and democracy.
The palinodie of the false true Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: the one of the powerful necessity of a return of the political one, but also the one of the disrupting feeling of his impossibility, of his incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be surpassed.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today moved itself, and that, for a lot of them, the republican soldiers no longer pull in the good direction.
We have nothing to win to demand a succession of national referenda, organized to the taste necessities and in dispersed order.
A free hand to the European absolute monarch or an on foot joined jumps in the emptiness of the nationalist fold: which choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want any cleavers but an exercise, common, of full right, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is not crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, to the Portugal - one would not know besides where to stop l" enumeration - for there is only a crisis, and she is in Europe.
It is Europe completely that folds itself to the diktats of the markets and credit agencies, that suffers as a result of his powerlessness and of his defect of solidarity.
It is Europe completely that is humiliated on the international scene.
One worries about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - but it is Europe completely that loses gently his sovereignty, and with her each of its nations.
The urgency, this is to give again to the popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
For it is together, that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, liberate itself markets and prepare the future while investing.
The go out of crisis will suppose decisions at the European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, safe of course to drive us to the disaster.
After a long time to have fought this suggestion of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone claims today the European economical government.
Is.
But to think it without a political and democratic integration stronger, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must assume a new step of the European construction.
To do the Republic in France, it was necessary "to do" republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains in effect.
We must construct a more integrated Europe on the economical plan.
That will be able to be done only while constructing a more democratic Europe on the political plan, a true European popular sovereignty.
To do Europe, let's do the Europeans.
The cards to flea "without contact" generalize themselves
The world-wide parlor of the card to flea opens Tuesday to Villepinte, close to Paris, in a climate optimist.
The year 2011 in fact should finish itself on an increase of 11% of the world-wide sales of cards to microprocesseur (bank card, telephones with card SIM. ..), to more than 6 billion unities, according to the office Eurosmart.
The segment the more carrier is the one of the technology without contact that allows paying the public transit or to regulate its purchases while approaching simply the card of a reader.
This year, 460 millions of cards to flea without contact should be sold through the world, against 320 million a year earlier!
Their party again should progress in 2012 (580 millions of unities awaited) and represent close to 10% of the global market of the card to flea (6,925 millions of cards).
A long time to the leads region Asia Peaceful, Europe wins land for the payment without contact.
Some 26 millions of bank cards already Aimed are equipped of this functionality and 75,000 final ones of payment accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Aimed were deployed.
But the hypermarkets put the mouthfuls double.
Intersection thus emitted this year 2.5 millions of cards Step MasterCard without contact.
To pass to superior speed, it is necessary henceforth that the banks equip their customers.
"Two big French establishments were involved themselves to broadcast in the future systematically to their customers of the bank cards equipped for the without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, general director Aimed Europe France.
The banks test the payment by movable
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the movable telephone.
Few devices today are equipped technology NFC (Near Field Communication) essential to carry out transactions.
"They took delay".
"But they at last should know a true leap the next year".
"We bank on the sale of 80 to 120 millions of unities in 2012 in the world", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks make the first move.
The agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test of December to next June to Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and assistants will be equipped of a holster authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project to Strasburg and Marseilles.
And the general Corporation, she also, said yesterday to prepare the placement on the allowing market of an offer to its customers to pay without contact with their movable one.
Sahara to the Nigeria, the terrorist forehead spreads itself
Paris worries about the links between Al qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Suspected of long date, the links between the terrorist group Al qaida to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram confirm themselves.
Sunday, the vice minister Algerian of the foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even asserted that Algiers has some henceforth "obtain the certainty".
"The manner of which the two organizations operate and the reports of the services of piece of information show that there is well cooperation", it explained without more of precision.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation on the rapt of two French to the Niger in last January would have disclosed links.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by close of Aqmi, Antoine of Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the next day at the same time that several of their abductors at the time of an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigators and nigériens had to rediscover several telephone fleas belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the past calls orients about several based speakers to the Mali, to Niger and to the Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigators: the one takes to a Nigérien that stayed at length to Maiduguri, a city of the north of the Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man that says itself close Aqmi and sect.
"This is an advance but it is necessary doubtless to await more definite proofs before to talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"One knows since years that the sect benefits from financial supports and exterior intellectuals and that she shows herself more and more active", tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
The latter months these "supports" had been more and more evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its methods opératoires, that imply henceforth the recourse to kamikazes or to explosive vehicles more and more complexes and of even bills than those used by Aqmi.
The international community, start with Washington, from that time did pressure on Abuja for that it takes into account the problems put by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities in fact a long time considered the group as a community of enlightened people not very worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, of a school and iman fondamentaliste Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - that means in haoussa "the western education is a sin" - advocates the Islamic instauration of an emirate in the Moslem north of the Nigeria.
In this poor region, the known association a quick success.
She becomes politicized and demands a strict respect of the charia while its militant ones engage the fight against the irreligious central government.
The latter aim first the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the campaigning Boko Haram show themselves particularly active, multiplying the attacks against the commissionerships.
The reaction of Abuja is, as to his habit, without nuances.
The army invests the city, one counts 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, stopped living, is killed in prison.
From that time the sect will toughen itself and leave its fiefs of the north.
To last Christmas, she claims an attempt that does 80 deaths to Jos, then another to Abuja.
In June, it is again to Abuja that Boko Haram takes it out on the reassured QG of the police at the time of an attack commits suicide, his first one.
In August, the local seat of the united Nations will be his first international target.
The terrorist creation of an axis in Africa that would sail Mauritanie to the Somalie while going through the worried Nigeria henceforth all the specialists of the security.
While Aqmi invested the Mali and Niger, that the Somalians of Al chebab operate to the Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, at the time of a discussion to the Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said itself ready "to divide all the pieces of information".
The world according to the republican candidates to the presidency
On China, on the Iran, on the assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete simplisme and of ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can she manage a complex world with simple, indeed simplistic ideas?
To listen the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
Since some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply the thundering declarations and the short cuts in the matter of foreign political, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on the Iran, on the assistance to Israel, the slogans - often not supported - burst out.
Mitt Romney, the more better placed in the race to the nomination of the "Big Old Party", threatened to lead the Chinese in front of the WTO and to question them "for manipulation of their change", a theme carrier in an America exasperated by the migration of entire sections of his industry towards Asia.
So worse if that must imply the commercial triggering of a war, it said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of political artificial foreign one, failed to strangle itself facing an attitude that "flatters" the emotions.
It called for a muscular but constructive dialog Peking (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, that stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
To the picture of Reagan
Romney equally promised military strikes on the Iran if penalties fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop the Iran, it boasted."
"If Obama is reelected, they will have the bomb."
It also promised to increase the military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama to fail to its obligations with respect to this partner.
The contractor Herman Cain, second candidate the more better placed, posts for his part an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, it called to oppose the Chinese military threat because Peking "tries to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant on account of the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, that supports Israel and wants strikes against the Iran, says itself ready, for his part, to engage the American army to the Mexico against the coalitions of the drug.
The recourse to the torture against the presumed terrorists, forbids by Obama in 2009, is equally recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a truck in foreign political.
The opponents of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and as it won the cold war.
They recall that Obama was itself an amateur and that it had to put water in his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They insist with reason on the naïve failure of his dialog with the Iran, on the too precipitated departure of the "houseboys" of Iraq, on its prevarications in Libya, sticking him thus a label of weak one.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population judges rather positive the report of national security of Obama, that eliminated Bin LADEN.
Since the Iraq, she distrusts the military interventions that drive to the enlisement.
And, while deducing that it is necessary to rebuild economically the America to revive his leadership, Obama hits more just.
The North Stream, new door of ntrée of the Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline North Stream, linking up directly western Europe to Russia while passing at the far end of the sea Baltic, entered in service.
It must furnish gas for the equivalent one of 30 millions of homes.
Gazprom, the gas giant Russian, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness.
More than 500 guests of which four heads of state and of government participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, to the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline that links up directly, under the sea, the Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together the flying one of the valve ordering the entry of the Russian gas in the network west European.
With this new gas pipeline one, 27.5 billion cubic meters additional of Russian gas will arrive each year in Europe western by a first tube of 1 224 km linking up the region of Holy pétersbourg to the mecklembourg-poméranie Land.
A second tube must be finished at the end of 2012, allowing delivering altogether 55 billion cubic meters of gas, is the equivalent one of French the very consumption.
And one already evokes the possibility of some to construct a third one on the same traverses.
For Gazprom, the achievement in time and in hour of this huge work-site has airs of victory.
The project strongly had been protested by the Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream in fact will allow delivering gas directly in Germany, while avoiding any passage earthly by a world third nation (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose a little their Power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to weigh on Russia while threatening of him to close the access to the markets wests European.
To the more fort of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new Soviet German pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy the Poland, in 1939.
This is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
Europe of the West, while bringing its support for this Russian project, there won a bigger security of its supplying.
But this is at the price of a weakening of Europe of the energy, since the project created a gap between European of the East and West.
Russia knew, in five years scarcely, let his vision of a direct alliance prevail between Russia and the rich western countries, strongly consumers of gas, and of which the deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is one composing from our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that secures us in a manner organic", confirmed François Fillon while inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing to which not at all the big gas contracts are as political as economical.
All that explains the wide ones smile posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is equally a technical exploit.
The submarine tube is in sheathed steel of concrete in order to protect it against the anchors of the vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, to 200 m in average.
To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
"A hundred must have been removed or destroyed, as a precaution", indicates Jens Müller, spokesperson of the corporation North Stream.
It was necessary also to multiply the measures to protect the wildlife and the flora.
The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, that nothing interrupts on all his length: or valve, or station of maintenance.
A check platform was foreseen to the wide one Sweden, but the people in charge of the project there renounced while the Swedish one were not very desirous to see a corporation of Russian State to establish itself in a manner permanent to the wide one of their coasts.
"In case of damages, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute", precise Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the contained gas in the gas pipeline escapes therefore in the air.
But this case is judged not very probable by the builders that foresaw the solders to know an escape all the 100 000 years.
The supervision of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by a submarine robot, led by a vessel, for the exterior observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
Form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
To the arrival, after three complete days of travels to the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers precise the news on the eventual deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was conceived to work fifty years without having to undergo the least repair.
The circulation of the gas simply is assured by the pressure.
She is of 200 bars at the start, and of 100 to the arrival.
Five corporations united their forces to realize this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, that keeps 51% of the parts.
Itself there joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five corporations created a common business, named North Stream, in charge of constructing and to operate the gas pipeline.
She has his seat to Zoug, in Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.
Gazprom next rented to this corporation, for twenty renewable years, the entirety of the capacities of transportation of gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the quantity of actually transported gas", precise Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was assured to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank ready.
The total cost of the works should attain the 7.4 billion Euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment brought up itself to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to return in their expense, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a coastal planted sablonneux of pines.
Valves, high of 4.5 meters, form the door of go out of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and the specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this final one receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas to every hour that passes.
To full capacity, this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012, 6 million.

One is far confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine surpasses the Italian borders and exports itself in 70 countries, France until the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait robot of the buyer, for the grade notebook seduces just as well the businessman as the student and the professionals.
To the picture of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, opened spirit and cultivated.
The small Italian business, that counted 12 employees to its beginnings, in account almost 100 today and disposes since 2008 of two offices; the one to Milan and the other to New York.
She distributes its notebooks in the bookstores, Fnac to the small shops of center city and knew to impose his identity.
"We followed the air of the time and this new need of writing, despite the leap of the e-mail", explains Got married Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exposition "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a cover in leopard, to the occasion of the Festival of the film of Locarno.
Taking advantage of his success and of this will have cultural, Moleskine knew to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, slip-covers d'ordinateur.. The brand declines itself on all a range of supports.
A success that did the envious one: to the fall 2006, Way Way was repurchased by the funds of investment SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
