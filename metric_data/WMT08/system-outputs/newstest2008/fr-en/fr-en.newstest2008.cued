Unlike the central banks American, British and Canadian, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not fallen the rate of Intéret director by saying that the reduction of Intérets, with the growth of the price of Matieres Premieres and reducing the rate of unemployment, would lead has the generation of a spiral inflationary.
The ECB would like to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to 2%.
According to a analyst, it is the catch 22 for the ECB: "We must deter" inflation has, so that we do not have to speak on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3% is a record during these Dernieres twelve years and in Spain, it is up 3.6 has 4.1.

Gallup indicates a crisis of government
Apres a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (alliance of young Democrats) has significantly increased at the beginning of December. And since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institute polling) has never seen before a weak Socialist support, namely 13%.
For the voters Fideles, the difference would be, because of the greatest determination of voters in the opposition, support of more than two thirds (71%) against the support of a Cinquieme (20%) for the Mszp (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (forum Democrats Hungarian) and the Szdsz (alliance of free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is of 2% in the entire population.
On the voters Fideles some to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties rose by 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in comparison with the previous point the lowest, the proportion of those who have ruled that the economic situation in the country was Particulierement serious has never been so high, it amounts has 41% and according to 46% supplementary the situation is serious.
Apres more optimistic prospects of spring and last summer, families are again more pessimistic about their situation Financiere.
For next year, the majority of the population provides for a worsening and only a Dixieme provides for an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71% of those polled, has a majority that has not been seen in the polls earlier Gallup, have ruled that the Prime Minister was his work more harm than good.
13% of those polled have confidence or a great deal of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor Orbán.
54% are not at all confidence in the Prime Minister and 27% to the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society belief that discontent vis-a-vis the Prime Minister can be Treaty without change of government.
While Apres riots last October, 35% of those polled wanted the government and Prime Minister remain in office, the rate currently accounts for only 20%. The relative majority (33%) believe that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
Has the question about intend to vote, 60% of those polled meet that they would certainly vote and the 20% supplementary say they would probably vote.
To make a comparison, for a' legislative election organise next Sunday', only 55% of those polled participate certainly and 15% supplementary participate probably. Following the current intentions, the result of the referendum would no doubt.
74% of people would say no to the fees in higher education, 79% say not at the expense of consultation and 84% say not at the expense of residence has the hospital.
Only when we look at the Memes proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively, 81, 84 and 89% of voters reject the introduction of fees, charges of consultation and costs of residence has the hospital.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its price of ESRP of 20%
The big supermarkets implanted in the triangle trading Budaörs kept the average increase price of 16% of the year Derniere has the difference that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Rule of Napi Gazdaság (economy daily)
This year, in the triangle trading Budaörs, a basket of Christmas daily usual also has risen from 16% on average, an increase of far greater value has thousand agricultural-environment is clearly state in all the big supermarkets.
Prices, "who had already gone' in large shops food last December, no longer have increased brutally by report has the basis high previous.
However, consumers are of course shocked to see that Articles bought far below nine thousand agricultural-environment year Derniere Coutent now more than ten thousand agricultural-environment.
The basket daily in the big supermarkets those polled has exceeded 91 agricultural-environment, at least, the threshold psychological ten thousand agricultural-environment.
And the value of the highest basket stood has 10 573 agricultural-environment.
(In 2003, this was value of 6 800 agricultural-environment.)
The price of Unicum and fish living remained almost in the year Derniere, however, the price of net Turkey, nuts and poppy have increased considerably.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread has followed the data of Ksh (Institute central statistics), but in Auchan, have been found bread of a kilo has 139 agricultural-environment only.
Competition has not fallen below the price of the product of 200 agricultural-environment.
It was surprising, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle record of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 agricultural-environment, it Coutait that 257 agricultural-environment recorded the bottle is understood.
It Empeche that this year, in terms of basket daily, Auchan was the more expensive and Cora cheapest.
To Apres our calculations, Cora has increased the price of its daily basket of 15% while Tesco and Auchan have increased respectively of about 18% and 18.
By comparing the basket the more of the year Derniere and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a gap of 12% while the difference between the cheapest year Derniere and the more expensive to this year is of 21%.
Prices rose by 1 480 agricultural-environment on average.
The year Derniere, prices rose by 1 206 agricultural-environment on average, knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was already noticed in the price of Christmas of last year.
This process has made perplexed trade, the big supermarkets could not determine clearly what margin apply on products as they were unable to provide for the impact of change prices on consumption.
(if a trader calculated badly the rotation of a product, it is in danger of losing a major advantage on the margin adapted has the intensity of trade.)
As a result of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in the price of basket daily has evolved Maniere so excessive basket that the more expensive was higher 1 720 agricultural-environment has the value of that of 2006 when the difference between baskets the cheaper was only 844 agricultural-environment.
This year, the difference was not if excessive since the value of basket the more expensive was in excess of 1 630 agricultural-environment has that of the year Derniere and cheaper prices rose by 1 284 agricultural-environment also.
By bringing the two seasons Christmas, we have seen an increase in prices, catastrophic in less than 20 months the price of Articles of daily consumption have increased by more than 30% in the big supermarkets.
(This confirms not necessarily data Ksh: for certain Alimentations of premiere need, the Institute of statistics has seen an increase in prices over 30% in 12 months.
That is the case for example of flour and of the egg.)
According to the daily shopping basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, already well expensive year Derniere, has increased by has just over 10% compared has the basis.
According to the evidence, the suppliers of meal occupy a stronger position that suppliers egg because they have succeeded has to accept the sharp rise in prices also by the multinationals.
In the golden triangle trade, the big supermarkets not complain not, they are constantly good years.
To Apres our experiences, the majority of customers will look more prices in the three big supermarkets visited.
They Achetent while quantity, they take the food long-life by hues.
On Wednesday morning of tails important have formed the coffers of the three big supermarkets because the number of customers has increased suddenly.
Indeed, according to our information, the turnover is less important province, many multinationals complain Aupres companies Survey 2006 can not achieve turnover planned, not only for food but also for the articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals are economy on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The conditions hygienic hospitals, the number of insufficient beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help has block infections, says the doctor chief of the national centre of epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also the economy on disinfectants
There is no long an infection MRSA has been diagnosed in the service of Traumatologie hospital János.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected on a man in hospital following has a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection in 2006 place.
The injured a serious car accident is out of the hospital but little time Apres it has of return because of infection MRSA and, since, doctors have not been able to make an operation important because of the bacterium which is in its body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 infections Hospitalieres generated by an agent Pathogene Multirésistant have been declared the Systeme national monitoring nosocomial, has indicated Karolina Böröcz doctor, chief of the national centre of epidemiology.
Has to know that this is the number of infections caused by an agent Pathogene Multirésistant which has really been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Some two-thirds of infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, in other words by the staphylococcus aureus resistance has the Méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people are carrying the bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus (its) in their nose without to develop a disease.
The infections caused by its (such as Angines, Amygdalites infections, skin, infections traumatic) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if the antibiotics are used to Maniere excessive or inappropriate, the bacteria, which reacts to antibiotics, develop a bacterium well resistant to antibiotics which Proliférera quickly in the poor conditions Hospitalieres.
In the event of poor functioning provisional or extended the Systeme immune, this bacteria can cause infections Hospitalieres serious, such as a infection traumatic or endotoxic, on the sick older, small weight or with a weakened body.
According to the doctor director of the hospital János, there is nothing particularly in infections MRSA, these infections are parts of the daily hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is no MRSA only the or the it seeks not, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The its resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, carers puts gloves rubber and masks of protection and we have of antibiotics suited to the cure", said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, patients in hospitals are examined if they are carrying MRSA, however infection can not always be avoided.
The Prélevement of the sample is not has fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by the MRSA could be prevented but the conditions and the present circumstances are not in favour, in hospitals Hungarians, to prevent the development and the proliferation of agents Pathogenes resistance, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection manifests itself in the hospitals and above all in the old peoples homes, hospitals should monitor the sick hospital and isolate the sick immediately carry MRSA.
However, the Prélevement microbiological is not has fashionable in hospitals Hungarian.
We must bear in mind that the fund national social security to fund these tests.
Most cases sees the day that if the infection MRSA is detectable on the patient, said the doctor chief of central epidemiological.
The European Union has strict recommendations on has adapted the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are directives Hungarian also for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
We must make efforts to that therapy antibiotic is targeted, in other words examinations microbiological should be made to Empecher resistance to medicines hospitals but not always take account.
Achieving Prélevements microbiological is even more rare in outpatient care and care basis, gave Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are economy on disinfectants
Scientific evidence suggests that the MRSA Proliferent of ill has another more often through the medical staff.
It is therefore vital to wash their hands, to put gloves and masks of protection, but important shortcomings are detected in hospitals in this area.
The MRSA Proliferent by infection forwarded by inhaling droplets and by contact, but because of the conditions in hospitals Hungarians, the patient contaminated can not always be isolated.
Moreover, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too ESRP each other when in terms of an epidemic, patients should be far apart from each other to 1.5 metres to a minimum.
Unfortunately, we can also see as hospitals, situation Financiere difficult, cut back on disinfectants, they lack Infirmieres, patients are many, the risk of contamination is even greater, has indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower of Maniere demonstrable or the proliferation of the agent Pathogene can be blocked.
Project government against the MRSA
The treatment of the infection MRSA represents exorbitant expenditure for the coffers of social security, which is why we fight against this everywhere infection.
In Britain, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to information published, this programme is effective and infection MRSA show a tendency declining in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reveals among its priorities in the incidence of prevention agents Pathogenes resistance (as the MRSA also) and the prevention of infections Hospitalieres caused by these agents Pathogenes.

Investors more vigilant Achetent already in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to the analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria seek in 2006 time has to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others are of France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly in Romania.

Fodor 6% and Hungarian
According to the communication Gábor Fodor, Minister for the environment and water, the meetings of professionals is Achevent Tuesday, Wednesday, yet Apres the official opening of Ministers, the negotiations on the system of international climate Apres 2012 will continue.
The experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries of the world will discuss on the road map in Bali supposed to define the efforts has done Apres the period of reducing emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, serious discussions are carried out in that connection between the developing countries and the developed countries.

The Troisieme demand wants a guarantee, in Matiere of retirement age before the legal, which would allow in the Systeme functions who deserve before 2010.
The Quatrieme reason for action is the rejection by the free trade Union of railway workers (Vdszsz), linked to the trade unions in the league, of the proposal of Ministere of the economy and transport on the railway lines secondary and waiting for another proposal.
Political capital: the guard Hungarian has increased the risk countries
According to the division risk analysis of political capital (risk analysing division), the activity of the Hungarian guard, consists in Aout last, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (movement for a better Hungary) is increasing, in many respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "warning of risk, society point out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian guard, the greatest risk policy is already that" in the short term ethnic clashes aggressive can happen following has the worsening of the ethnic tension already existing between the population Gypsy and not gypsy Hungary'.
The research institute has added that the political strategy guard Hungarian aimed probably has cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, it is because of one of the main shortcomings of political actors Hungarian: the public actors have passed the public debate on the matter of Roma representatives of political groupings radical and extremes that have a political strategy based on the dispute between the Roma and Hungarian'.
The Probleme is aggravated, the normal dialogue impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of conflicts aggressive is more likely, they say.
Indeed, according to the research institute, as a result of the increased attention media Hungarians and international activity guard Hungarian "has deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary has abroad, in particular on the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country.
They remind us that, following has greater publicity has given the reorganisation of radical groups and extremes right Hungarian since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations were set in Hungary since the summer of 2007 is giving the name of' national association Self-defense'.
"The common feature of these rallies is that they define as a civil organisation when they say publicly preparing their accession has missions defence (disasters, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the inability of the police, the military, in other words of the State, have added.
They have pointed out that everything was going following the method which, on the basis of the by society policy and parties, seeks has disguising different political ambitions under a civilian aspect.
The emphasis on the Caractere civil and the statute of association serves only that has avoided Pieges legal of the registration of these associations in court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity guard Hungarian is a factor that is also increasing the risk in relation to the neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries cite guard Hungarian as a potential source of risk and politicians ultranationalists of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their political Anti-Hungarian with reference has the Constitution guard Hungarian.
This influence the political stability of the region, have added.
According to the Institute of research, the Constitution guard Hungarian is not a single Phénomene in Central Europe, have increased political risks on the region as a whole.
As they say, the functioning of the guard Hungarian looks like, for example, has the activity of the National Guard Bulgarian whose constitution has been declared by the Bulgarian national Union (Bnu) Aout in 2007.
The many Roma disorders that have occurred in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the Bnu decided to set up a guard by saying that the objective of the organisation is "self-defense national'.
In their view, these Dernieres 17 years, the Roma have terrorised'' Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, remind the political capital.
They have added that the initiative had given rise to intense debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of some organisations of Roma Bulgarian on the Constitution of their own guard by way of resistance to point out the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the guard Hungarian showing similarities with that of the National Guard Bulgarian not ruled out that the Roma Hungarian react has the threat of the 2006 Maniere by organising their own self-defence, can we read in the warning of risk of political capital.
At the request of information of the Agency brief, Attila Juhász, director of research of political capital, said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events taking place that could have an impact on the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a warning of risk.
The Fete is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of Fete and, around Fetes, it became aware of reorganising the working days whose number will reduce the next year.
The Fetes are not uniform in the EU and the us either.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of Fete national and state and day of rest.
The rest days are often linked has Fetes religious or has historic events important.
In Hungary, we Fetons the new year, the last day of the year which ends and the first day of the new year are also rest days, all the more so that the Réveillonneurs can rest in peace.
Moreover, in a year, we have in any eleven Fetes marked in red.
On 15 March is a Fete national, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as on 23 October also which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 Aout, we Fetons the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the Fete labour and on 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and friends who have died.
Moreover, we have two days has Easter, has the whit and has Christmas.
The days of our Fetes State, national or religious falling rarely on a weekend, according to the timetable, it became aware of reorganising the working days in cases or it is a working day before or Apres the Fete marked in red.
It is true that we are paying the price of weekend sustained by working or by going has school on Saturday before the weekend extended.
For many years, the Minister of labour rules in a regulation Particuliere on the days of replacing days before or after the Fetes.
The law extends to all employers and for all their employees employees, on the officials and on the people working in the public service.
It does not, however, for the service companies, the institutions without interruption and turning point in service, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be modified only around Fetes of the end of the year: from 24 December, life is private almost throughout the country because according to the most people experience rather overtime or taking holidays they have saved has these purposes in order to move the days between the day of Christmas and New Year at home.
The next year many Fetes fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the days of work has this year.
The timetable will be reorganised the premiere time around the Fete labour to allow employees to stay at home four days of Affilé.
On Saturday 25 April will one day be working for a day of rest on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: on Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing the Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year ahead with the sign of Fetes because from 24 December, everyone will stop non-stop 2006 if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.

If you want to respond to the expectations, you no es more interesting
We advance slowly in the usual matters in the morning.
Everything has once, a tune Particuliere be heard has radio: the voice of a violin has effects which electronic associated.
I amounts the Its.
Music exchange rate and the low comes to accompany the tone of any at a time, then a choir female has just join as a true smart.
Mr2 diffuse the song wings of love of Zagar.
Life music Hungarian has spoiled point for a long time with a MAGP electronic of good quality.
However, now it seems that matters is different if you tapping the new Smiths of Zagar.
The emergence of Yonderboi, some new production interesting arising from the underground digital Hungarians are beginning little has little has changed the overall picture and, despite the new way of rock siding harrowing the Guitare, the Hungarian électropop proves that there is the new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came of Pécs and it was playing own in the Group of Yonderboi before it embarks on its own way, Peut-etre because there is no room for two feet in a 2006 footwear'.
Its draft (Zagar) and its music, a compound of jazz, music Dansante electronics and MAGP, began has become well known when he was entrusted the composition of Soundtracks filmed (P.ex.
The season Ferenc Török).
The training playing at the beginning in small clubs began has to be known by greater public when the magazine Wan2 quoted their first Smiths of 2002 among the most important 50 records market Hungarians and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the trend Hungarians would also be competitive has the West.
Zagar and whole have become undoubtedly trendy'' but nobody their asked whether they wanted well bring this label.
The group has responded properly, it has out a new and better record.
The Smiths entitled cannot walk fly instead, out recently, can open up new paths for them, although the title would represent continuity with the previous years has Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but alongside music air now appears, following the spirit and the tendency of the time, the Guitare stronger impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer working currently in England with the group the puzzle, has shown its talent in these songs at the premiere of the Smiths the park millennium.
On the Smiths, there is a true tract for radio, Mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting recently of the popular music from morning till night, has started to introduce the drowning of wings of love registered with six Chanteuses Hungarian ("underground'').
So good therefore (?).
Hvg.hu has asked questions has Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: this new tract leads me has put a question: does your music is remained a music for some layer?
Zságer Balázs: the term of music for some layer I said no great thing.
For me there are two castes in music Légere; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop music but trade and music sincere.
The music itself saying alternatives, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and become and trade.
However, a good pop song can be sincere.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of the language or Frontieres.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference between the public and Hungarian Foreign, is it that one or the other is more open has your music?
Zs.b.: has abroad, especially the West has music Légere most old traditions.
The, people go to the concerts and young people not only a dozen or Vingtaines years but also the elderly.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have taken place in the music Légere because they believe that it is also part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what is the role of the public in tone work?
You interested to know which, or and how many people listening to your music?
Zs.b.: I am of course pleased that people are increasingly Many has our concerts.
However, we have never done music for the market.
For us music is not made in order to achieve the objective but for a very reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or influence mutual functioning health but it is perceived that changes in the elusive.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted to respond to the expectations of the public, you will be more interesting.
Hvg.hu: do you follow the example of Auditors Yonderboi?
It is working only and Carriere rather has the West.
Zs.b.: we really do not follow its way 2006 if sometimes some are trying to find traces in our music.
We are rather players in team that have confidence in the presence music for others and let us be deployed.
At the beginning, it was inevitable that on our music is compared has that of Yonderboi because many of us has leaving his group and has taken a different path.
Hvg.hu: on the Palmares of Mr2 Petõfi, wings of love holds the premiere place.
Many people have heard the name of Zagar for the premiere time by means of this song.
With this style more popular you open consciously towards a layer broader?
Zs.b.: we have not provided to a tract to sell the record.
This song means more.
We have sought to the final Smiths to try to mitigate the orgy of sounds and the most difficult themes addressed in all the record.
Hvg.hu: how do you chosen the six Chanteuses?
why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.b.: the idea was to have a choir gender gospel.
We have had the idea of putting together this choir good youth of the scene music Hungarian.
And was made up the choir has six Members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi neo [], Juci Németh, that has been described as then underground'.
Hvg.hu: you wanted this song like this or girls have changed a little?
Zs.b.: this piece already existed for a long time in a version instrumental and then when we have put together the Smiths, we thought it was still something has this song.
As a result of agreements drew the voice of the song.
I have sung night 2006 the tune that girls have learned later.
I have been almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that I was galvanized at that time but we needed to edge of'.
With my voice it would not have had the 2006 force.
Hvg.hu: on the record and the chorus also I thought that girls were Arriere plan.
There is no solo (with the exception of a solo short of Judy Jay), they have no role only, they sing all together and they not sing stronger than the music, therefore music is not that accompany their song.
They were Derriere on the scene.
Is it wanted?
Zs.b.: the fact that they were in Arriere plan is the only has Problemes technical.
On the other hand, which was voluntary, is that we did not want to distribute roles of solo.
The song also said that we must abandon a little our egos, forget that has just or, which will or, we must just leave that these wings, the wings of love, we win.
I wanted the other feel that state euphoria that we have felt when the song is born.
Hvg.hu: which songs you did the more work?
Zs.b.: in fact, no about the process of creating music, we have had pieces more difficult at the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray' s dilemma, or I plays has a piano together, or with Rock' N'roll via to the girls, or the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, small has small, everything is put in place as in a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your preferred on the new Smiths?
Zs.b.: this is changing all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already dropped'' this record.
At the moment, these are prophet is has fool, escape from the earth and never the same.
The Tradeur perfidious has risky billions because of his inferiority complex
a fraudster Dissimulateur.
And appoints its former used the giant French society general, the owner of the Bank Czech Komerční Banka.
The Bank has lost due to almost EUR 5 billion.
But it seems rather than Kerviel is only a major player who wanted to match his colleagues, and which, furthermore, can not be regarded as incapable.
Contrary to all the major houses of Bank, he acknowledged in time the crisis of the market mortgages American.
"It is fragile," have implied superiors who denounced the police.
However, if we stick to the evidence of Kerviel reported in the media French, which the world, the transactions of this man have produced at the end of last year a benefit amounting to EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis over the US
"all I wanted to, it was make money for my bank", he says in the statement.
Last summer, he has managed to take the crisis American to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, it has felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that the so-called' mortgages sub-prime', given to customers low-income or to those who had met in the past difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not influence the economy as a whole.
Kerviel scepticism about them and it has been.
And, at the end of the year, its benefits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half a million people, I did not know how the announce", entrusts Kerviel and would add that it did, of course, nothing kept for himself. "
In all the interrogation, it must admit have distorted the reports so as not to be environment.
He has managed to fool superiors, although the stock market Eurex has begun to take an interest in its transactions.
That risks nothing N Geneva has nothing
Craignait-il to be found?
In fact, it is not.
"I felt that the mere fact of obtaining 1.6 billion for the Bank would meet."
Where its willingness to risk if major?
It has managed to his post that gradually.
It had begun to work in society in general 2000 just after he finished its studies at the University of Lyon.
Their salary annual revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it was already assistant Tradeur and, in 2005, it has become Tradeur independent with a salary annual 90 thousand dollars.
However, he knew that it would gain ever as far as the other.
"Since I first meeting in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered that the other.
In view of my university curricula and of my professional experience and staff, "said the investigators Kerviel.
However, shortly after he took office, it has its first great success.
Thanks to the actions Allianz, he won half a billion euros building on the reduction of this title in London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As you Gagnes, you left alone
"There were as a snowball effect," he said policemen.
But the higher knew of all, or rather, they knew.
"As I Gagnais, as if they were to turn a blind eye."
But then comes the scope of the beginning of the year.
It loses EUR 1 billion in a day.
Has Mid-January, after the weekend, it decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to work, it is no longer employee of the Bank.
A few days later, the Bank announcement that it has lost EUR 5 billion because of him.
And how is it that has discovered?
It has become suspect because of his leave.
"The last year, that was only four days leave.
A trader which does not take holiday is a trader that does not allow his book' to another, concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers have signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the years to come, make 14 billion (around EUR 365 billion kronor Czechs) to the Czech Republic.
It is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can achieve in Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes will be intended for regions Czechs.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor in the framework of the programme company and innovation.
The transport sector will benefit from the most, up to 150 billion.
The programme transport is the most important and the operational programme is up to 22% of financial resources that the Rép. Czech can achieve in the framework of these projects.
This money will cause an increase in the budget from the bottom national transport infrastructure which will manage next year a sum of payments billion kronor.
The programme company and innovation, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more effective.
So far, the Czech Rép. was part of the new members, beneficiaries of EU funds the less successful.
The Court has confirmed the trouble to 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua has confirmed on Thursday sentenced to 20 years in prison for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 to fraud of $100 million (approximately 1.8 billion kronor).
However, later it was released and lived under house arrest in its Hacienda around the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of state this Centre-américain, depending between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again Encarcéré is at the moment, according to the Agency PA, unclear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will depend on now prison officers, or they will leave Aleman end his sentence at home, or will again in prison.
There are four years, the Court has proved that Geneva Alemán was regularly money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
It was fictitious companies and the accounts were in fact the members of his family and supporters closer.
Some of this money has gone into the funds that Geneva Alemán was created in order to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That is the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
Why is this budget is exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by the government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
One for the current year happened a year ago thanks to the support of the Socialist Party Czech čssd, because it is the Minister Sobotka who had prepared and čssd could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the turbulent debate before the vote of the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies adopted without any problem this law which, although the more influential, is usually neglected.
That is something of a paradox.
We like it or not, each chapter and every rule are the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is constituent part of the policy, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media coverage and that is why we give more attention in the media.
The disputes politicians are much more l Geneva opinion that the figures rash.
The national budgets of socialist governments are suffering from past three ills that the current budget is not able to deal with both:
The first is the important given at the expense of mandates imposed by law, set up not only by pensions, but also by social security contributions, adopted last year by the "coalition' silent composed of the parties čssd and Ksčm.
The second is an economy deficit, as a result of the first evil.
The third hurdle, him, is the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, this is not the budget deficit State which is the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb, it is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors broadcast, often in stunned, obligations, disproportionately into their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, rights tax and appropriations Bank, new sources of investment.
In previous years, they managed to repay these debts by selling the actions of mass distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained of the State in the framework of privatisation.
Today, they have more of this Souce.
If we stick to the facts only official and verifiable, we see that:
Our economy is already for several years, like the rest of the world, a period of growth and čssd does not fail to Venter.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But, instead, they Endettaient the rule of more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs far more reasonable that our Republic.
It is a disgrace monstrous which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of the countries that, on a global scale, are less threatened by poverty.
There is therefore no need to social programmes massive who, precisely in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily Enflés.
Although it has managed to remove some of the expenditure populist absurd, approved last year before the elections, if a discrepancy of the age limit for retirement, and a reform of the pension system will not happen soon, then any political will cease to exist in that country and anyone who will be in power, it will only administer.
In éxagérant barely, we can say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats distributing Méchaniquement the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget can not be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which means that the costs are ordinary rejected by the costs of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion scheduled for 2008 would be unnecessary if the previous governments had not remove all the money that they could.
If we really do not want that policies in power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile coalition government, aware that the state can not spend that the equivalent of what happens to take in taxes and rights tax, calm necessary to the preparation of new laws of reform.
There is that recent which will gradually a budget State balanced.

The banks want to resolve the crisis
The Federal Reserve of Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Switzerland and Canadian have decided to combat all the crisis of the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets by the Intermédiare of auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, by a system of auctions, interest rates Auquels they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the EDF American will send at auction $40 billion and, furthermore, it will provide 24 billion to the European central banks and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual States have determined action so concerted, to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"It tends to resolve the major problems of the economy growing, namely the lack of free capital that banks could pay', writes in his report to customers Bernard Baumohl society Council economic outlook group.
"The concerted action by central banks has diminished the likelihood of a recession in the United States of 65% to around 50%', adds Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because loans not reimbursed, especially in the US.
Analysts are still waiting other losses in billion.
"If central banks have chosen this approach is that they should really understand what can be successful," said the chief economist of the AMRO agitated Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad', adds.
The central banks fear that, if the banks themselves will have a difficult access to loans, they will pay more to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and plunge the US economy into recession can influence the economic growth of the world.
The central banks have made this choice after that we have not managed to bring down the interbank rate of London, called Libor, used to borrow interbank on the market.
Which meant that banks feared always borrowing mutual, despite the fact that the central banks American, Canadian and English have fallen on several occasions, in the autumn, their interest rates.
"It will have the same effect that a further cut in interest rates," said the Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio society Tempus consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of central banks nothing to prevent the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem which is the fall of the housing market in the US.
President Klaus: the debates ecologists are incredible
Global climate change are supposed to harm, above all to the developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again opinion on the problem of global warming.
The critical struck this time on the UN International Conference on climate change out in Bali.
Has Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not Green, he stated that the debates ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric the accompanying and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President has pointed out, when presenting his book, which it has great importance for him and that is why it is committed to this cause.
It has also expressed its satisfaction of what its White appears also in German translation, since, he said, "I do not often meeting that the caricature of my views'.
Now, the interested parties can read its positions without them to be distorted.
Klaus pointed out that, although it is not weatherman, it has nevertheless, in his opinion, enough of provisions to draw up such a white.
This is an academic able to follow and assess Treaties scientific, it has the practice of the statistical and it is also economist.
The major conclusions of the books, is, according to him, the arguments: the climate change is constantly evolving, it is normal there is no view of all researchers on climate change, the effects of the current changes are neither excessive nor so serious, they do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, unacceptably inefficient and expensive.
All the more that with the experience of a totalitarian regime, it considers unacceptable to impose views Invérifiées to others what it feels as an attack dangerous to freedom.
In response to the questions of those present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against' a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a environmentalism fundamentalist which does not take account of the relationship between the costs and profit they make ".
Has Vienna, Klaus had already discussed this subject two months ago, to the Institute Hayek.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving licence in the time
Six hundred thousand drivers have left to run on and failed to renew their old driving licences whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask the renewal, so that the authorities are in their way to deliver a new licence before the end of the year.

Polívka has lost Valaiské Království (the Kingdom of Valaisko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the dispute about the marks Valaiské Království (the Kingdom of Valaisko).
According to the Court judge regional Ostrava, it is he who had used for the first time the title of King Valaisko, but the project has been set up by the team around Tomái Harabii, a former colleague of the player.
Polívka was not present at the hearing today.
Indeed, according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not finite and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr Harabii and his team Parasitent on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial of the lawyer Polívka.
In his view, the Kingdom of words Valaisko talk to everyone precisely this player and comical.
Harabii is of the same opinion.
"There is behind us work of almost ten years.
Money for research and development of events, "he said.
According to him, it is the money which is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they are aware of the fact that the project was successful and that they could benefit from them.
It is they who want parasitic on our work,' he added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, it is Polívka who used for the first time the title Valaiský Král (King of Valaisko) in its television programme.
The player Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned King in 1993.
However, at the time, there was no connection with the project to set up a Kingdom shadow.
A few years later, Harabii with the idea has come to seem passports of Valaiské Království.
Action humorous originally a business and a lucrative business, followed by the creation, by Harabii, society Valaiské Království.
In 1997 Polívka has accepted that his name and its signature are mentioned in the passport and it has even proposed to holders of balances on the price of the visit of its firm and its spectacles theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge has also mentioned that Harabii has simply use the idea nude, published by Polívka in the emission Manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of dumping Polívka Certainemement has helped the draft Valaiské Království," said the judge.
It has added, however, that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabii and his team who had dedicated himself to the draft intensively.
The cooperation between the parties today enemies continue until 2000 when Harabii organised for Polívka a culmination official Vsetín.
But on that basis, conflict began to accumulate between Polívka has Harabii, which culminated with the evidence "of King dumping 1 elected forever".
The leading role in the Kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabii, assumed by the singer Jarmila šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka has lodged a complaint against Harabii and its society, demand that the Court has now rejected.
What could clarify the matter, it is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the Princess.
It should produce a new king.
He was not yet betray the details and the date.
"We do not want to go fast.
It would be taken as the parade of kings to Slovácko.
The King would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course be ", has added Harabii.
Test of the Peugeot 207 Sw 1.6 Vti: Diparition prejudices
In fact, I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
His qualities of rolling were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, the conduct and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be qualified to less than the average.
However, there is currently on the market his successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more so because the combi appointed Sw goes even further, it only remains for me to reflect.
When I Testais the Hatchback classic of the Peugeot 207 I Plaignais for example of space for the head on the seats of behind.
While there over the complaints because the car combi means that large wretches will, in this regard, at home.
Will see quick
I am going to refer very quickly within too so as not to repeat myself.
This is a design more or less successful, my only comment on the Tunel central which seems to me to poor.
Here, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car sounds if elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain of seats or dossiers too short is over.
Guidance side-impact has also much improved in comparison to the model 206.
With regard to the area, an increase in the size of the car is sensitive here, too.
The combi disappear is also the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A boot in the boot
The most important on this vehicle, it is therefore its Soutte to luggage.
I have to assess it as very well accessible (also thanks to the ice Pivotante back) and stowage rather easy.
The blind spaces are in possession of elastic posts which constitute a compromise ideal.
It is not awkward and can be extended while being able to take objects Asez heavy.
But let us stop us volume.
This fact, according to the tables, 428 l in shaping basis, which is in relation to competition a figure rather way.
Apart from the Skoda Fabia combi vehicle, the more sold in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 Sw with the new generation of the product of Mlada dumping, we see that Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to go on holiday abroad or to instruct a she, this figure is almost criticism.
But, if I had to bring out the benefits, I would mention the below cash remaining after the overthrow of files seats back perfectly right, or a Marche-pied very low.
120 horses distributed on four cylinders
The car that we have tested was equipped with an engine Otto four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 L and a power of 88 KW.
In fact, and that is what should look like a 1.6 which walk a Hatchback family.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it is pushing well.
If I compare it with the equivalent of Skoda which often gives the impression of having a pot exhaust closed by a Serpillère, then I can not be enthusiastic.
If we examine the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that has been tested a car quite well equipped, with an internal spacious and a very good engine.
The price of a vehicle with an engine Otto 1.4 litres amounting to 329 900 Kč is still is satisfactory.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is bad enough.
The equipment premium, also tested, increasing the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have prepared and more airbags head, a air conditioning automatic, Essuis-glace automatic, a command automatic rear windows ...
In fact, the vehicle costs ultimately 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add at the cost of Fabia additional equipment, and you will get a figure very similar.
It is therefore more than to choose the mark.
The integration of pupils Slovak in schools Britaniques is doing badly

Cuba, the most beautiful island Caribbean
for visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
All you expect your leave can be achieved if you are a good choice.
Beaches gold and white as snow, high waves or a sea calm as a pond.
Of Palmes and all inclusive servers with you on the beach offering a pizza, of the ice or cocktails heady.
The Kitesurfing, the golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Sea of Caraîbes, you are not going to return to this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of big Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus has qualified as the best place as the eye human has never seen.
Havana has become the tabling and the place of transhipment treasures that the Spanish had stolen and carrying in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The hotel Nacional has been erected at the beginning of the 20 years'.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the Mafia American, which has done build, because everything a crime in the US (especially in the prohibition) was recognised and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Parmis its customers, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava, Frank Sinatra.
Has Havana, buildings at heights led and cars, from the symbols cults of 50 years' of the last century, were circulating on the broad avenues.
Ernest Hemingway has bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, almost Havana, and, to Cojímar, he had its yacht.
The stars of Showbusiness and politicians of America full leaving their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can allow yourself your autograph on the walls of Bodeguita Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a hotel luxury, you Mixera the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars cults still run in Havana, since the Jigoulis and the us once imported have already for a long time, in a climate if Salé and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the most old, is significantly decrepit, Nullepart elsewhere in the around there is so many monuments colonial splendid that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism provides the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels led not only in Havana, but above all to Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is proposing a fantasy which is unique in the world and which will be appreciated above all by fans small trains.
Cane was returned since the plantations extended in the sugar factories on a close by small trains and steam engine.
Their rolling stock was not renewed for decades and that is how we can see on the march of small locomotives whose contemporary are also only in museums.
Where direct its not?
The majority of visitors no shortage places the best-known.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or on Havana.
If not recall that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and those who like this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most corners fanciful to Cuba.
A vegetation Exhubérante forced on a soil chalk.
Of Mogotes, balloons limestone and rocks amount in candle from the bottom of the valley, and, of the fertile land has taken in their emergency, even its rock rotten are covered a carpet plant very dense.
The valley is where is grown probably tobacco Cuban of the highest quality.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of factories cigars Havana.
Someone will perhaps also interesting that was turned the Chilean episode of major.
Trinidad
City former based not long after the Spanish have colonised the island.
That is the market the slave trade and that of sugar which have brought glory and wealth.
The wealth has embodied in the beauty and the nature of that city Ville-vitrine smaller.
Koloniální Ipanělská Architektura, Výrazně Ovlivněná Pozdějiími Francouzskými Osadníky, Za čtyři Staletí Téměř Nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive mountainous Escambray, is a place to point out that even in the 1950s' of the last century, there was no road link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation enabled it to remain aside.
It is building nothing, and that is why we Démolissait nothing, everyone is simply to have a roof over their heads.
If, in Trinidad, more time that a afternoon, then it is worth go and see also places Interessants in the surrounding areas, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
Then, the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa of the Música which drives after the bed of sun and where music is Assourdit that the small morning.
Baracoa
Some appoint this village situated to the extreme is Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the road that leads.
The two roads leading up for Guantánamo must take mountains high and Accidentées and are going through a landscape almost without expressions of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the pitfall is of Cuba, thanks to its countryside intact, on the world heritage list.
It produces the best chocolate, to the Church, there is the Cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it has come about one hundred years after the journey Columbus) and since the hill where is the former Chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains table, the most famous is El Yunque.
On coffee, of rum, cigars, the massive mountainous Sierra Maestra, of the Bay of sows and the island Isla of Pinos, of cabaret Tropicana, of sanctuary of the Holy Patrone Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of the old slaves, about all this could play a host of pages.
Only, as you rightly said, it is better to see once.

The Secretary General of NATO Jaap of Hoop held today something similar.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have roughly 90% of soldiers and equipment we would need, and this is not enough, "said of Hoop to the Reuters news agency at the end of the negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
That is passive
In recent months there also between the countries involved conflict on the issue if all the allies are indeed their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have representation in Afghanistan relatively large.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the requirements of struggle which they are subjects are therefore not also rigorous than those in the south and east of the country in which we are operating, "said gates.
The tabloid Britanique sun has described this week the German soldiers of lazy.
"The Afghans who discovered: the Germans play, while our own fighting," wrote sun in a document supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing the Tenis table.

The anticipation of the analyst of next finance Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in the course of the year 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that has not yet.
If it appeared that the situation on the scene Polique changed, that policies were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not expect this change,' he said.
The debts are increasing
The debt of the State is the debts of the central government and it is mainly caused by the cumulation of the budget deficits of the state.

The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the budget of the state which will obviously Ateindre 76 billion kronor this year, instead of 91,3 billion kronor originally scheduled.
Secondly, it is a question of sources maximum provided for the Agency consolidation Czech, namely 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of titles of income of State for 43 billion Crowns and the reimbursement of the European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion kronor.
It likened today before a court in Khartoum to be appointed a bears in toy
The teacher British judged in Sudan to insult to Islam has been condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days imprisonment and deportation, has indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left pupils of 6 to 7 years give the name of Mohammed to a bears in toy while representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was punishable by a sentence of lashes.
This lady teacher British 54 years in office in the unity high school in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at home and convicted damage to Islam and insurgency, pursuant to Rule 125 of the penal code Sudanese, following a number of complaints from parents of pupils Auprés of the Ministry of Education Sudanese.
The story goes back in fact in September, when this teacher ask its pupils, between 6 and 7 years, to choose a name for the bear in toy class.
"Eight names out of the mouths of children, which Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed', tells the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as first name preferred.
Mohamed is, of course, the name of the Prophet Muslim, but above all a first name very common in Sudan.
Children have then achieved a white class with the photograph of the bear followed the legend' my name is Mohamed'.
The bear own was no label with the name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the Prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the members of Muslims Gillian monkey, teachers in the same school in Sudan, has said that he knew well and that it would never have done anything that can be insulting to a religious faith, "I regret that it has just asked the children to vote for a name', it is in his view that a' mistake' innocent.
View shared by many pupils of the teacher who describe as' very friendly to its pupils' and' which is never said of religion in class'.
Let us remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second name as given in Britain, it is written of English 14 different ways.
This first name often chooses by the families Muslim is a way to honour the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
For example, can we give a toy?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.

The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense Sunday, to exit polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their desire for stability, or even to authoritarianism, after a campaign very locked.
Three days of parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin addressing today to voters a message television on public service broadcasting, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
It is as high on the list of United Russia, the party Pro-Kremlin whose victory looks overwhelming.
Yesterday, President has not now revealed by receiving the ambassadors foreigners, simply to deliver a new burden against the West accused of interference - its favourite subject during the campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and want fair elections, the more transparent and open elections smoothly, "he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, there is still a long way to go.
It denounces a campaign tainted pressure.
The Communist leader Gennady Zuganov said that there has been no "elections also dirty, even at the time of Yeltsin'.
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the former of the World Chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for demonstration illegal, is still not allowed to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo Sovieticus'
Behind these legislative without suspense are emerging two issues much more open:
- who will succeed Putin to the Presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make known.
Voted in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not run a third term in a row.
But no successor has emerged.
- what role will play Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party which choose the government and President?
In any case, the legislative and presidential power outgoing will win.
This is a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo Sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their own destiny, think the sociologist Lev Goudkov, Director of the Centre independent Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, of the University of State of St Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has been delayed in that country Christianisé five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has brought the model of a state paternalistic, fully accepted by the population all the more that this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain amount of flexibility economic', think Maria Lipman, Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians' renounce of voluntarily personal responsibility' that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the USSR.
"What is the point of reflect?'
The phenomenon affects all social classes, including the world affairs.
And the elite administrative intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (on 85 heads of Russian regions) run the lists of local United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefer stability.
On behalf of what the Russians will not be voting for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a professor of 54 years: what is the point of reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why the change?'

A single aspect Ternissait its Joy:' My hurts, this is not the fact that we have more increased but that we have less fallen', Affirmait-il.
However, it has focused on the fact that on a weak market,' we have less fallen'.
Telecinco finished yesterday the day with a progress of 2.54%.
This gain stabilises its loss to 15,66% for the last year.
The stock market value of controlled by the company MEDIASET (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% in more) achieved and the 4.488,88 million euros, according to data Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, which has given yesterday 1,52% and which accumulates lower 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of other companies Comunication listed amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million in that of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with antenna 3 is of the fact that' we are talking about two companies similar.
The fact is on what we can do, on the same market, at what cost and how we Rentabilisons in terms of hearing'.
Telecinco announced last week that it provides for this year to become the first television channel to overtake the 1, 000 million income advertising raw, as has assured Giuseppe Tringali, the advisor delegate Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary managing the advertising of the group.
For that this fact announced is real, the television channel should register for the current year increased 3.6% in its billing for advertising in relation to the 965,4 million of the exercise of 2006.
For its part, billing net antenna 3 has increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to achieve the 734,4 million) While the net incomes of television rose by 0.7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that the Annalistes show, for the best development relative Telecinco stock market is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the compromise official to give for minimal 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make happy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to the analysts, gives the market at the moment signs of fatigue.
Lehman brothers has recently reduced its estimates of profits on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 2009, to 7%.
This is due, they argue, down to the predicted growth of income of 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company has fallen forecasting gains antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

As Secretary of the organisation of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono itself have announced for a press conference after the meeting held at midday federal the headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because' it is important to rely on the best "in political life and Bono" is among the best ".
Moreover, he said that "yes" It seems that the politician channel will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the Congress if the Socialists will win the next elections.
Bono replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, which he made public on 15 November its decision not to stand for Prochainess general elections and to abandon his political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the framework university.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the government has not stopped insist that it is the task at the forefront policy since he has abandoned two years ago.

A propaganda climate
Since the movement against climate change is submitting to a persecution without mercy both skeptics of its predictions that those who give priority to other political battles and social, it must demonstrate consistency iron.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement that is as President of the government Zapatero and who believes that this fight is greater than that of Islamic terrorism and which proposes even to sign a "new contract for the planet.
This approach requires to explain why the action, or inaction, his government have contributed decisively to what Spain is at the head of the European Union in the Non-éxecution protocols Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the Non-éxecution, in which sectors has produced and why his government, that of the contract with the world, has not prevented.
Moreover, it should be clear to the Spanish what measures it will take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what savings energy individual and collective we will be forced to do, what economic consequences that trigger.
That is to say, which will surrender and who is to pay for save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanations.
Precisely because it is to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed Electoralmente so dangerous to Zapatero that it has rushed to deny it.
That is to say that this is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real consequence.
With phrases which have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, Mr so useful for the election campaigns which does not speak, which is not denouncing and which does not require, painted the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited only to be a contracting party purely virtual and which does not claim that we refers in bicycle or we Rafraîchissions with the range.

What assurance I agree?
The motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, implies a spending important will depend on a number of factors, such as age, gender, age of driving licences, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the Internet, among others.
Having a car that is the main.
There are that, Escoger El Seguro of Automóvil Adecuado ES Incluso' Difícil that Elegir El Gruma of Vehículo.
And that is that, choose the motor insurance adequate, is even more difficult than choose the model of the vehicle.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by a contract insurance, which states that the company receives the value of the premium paid and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which establishes taking account of various factors such as age, gender, age of driving licences, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the Usageque we in fact, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices in line of statistics, so that more likely to have an accident is high, the more popular to pay is high.
It is for this reason that the people of more than 25 years and women have to pay premiums lower, since the statistics show that these Persones have a rate lower claims of their caution.
In the same way, using of censuses, companies have concluded that the people married tend to have fewer accidents that drivers single.
The use of the vehicle that affect the frequency, and therefore on the likelihood of having an accident.
By increasing frequency the likely increase.
There are many of the variables that insurers take into account in establishing the price of the premium.
That is why, that the driver must study the situation in choosing the motor insurance which is best suited to its profile.
We would have to express here the variables at the time of the most significant choose one or other types of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have to deal with various disadvantages when a contract with insurance at a price accessible, as can be the low experience in the conduct and the age of driving licences.
Although the ideal to be well be assured insurance to any risk, other options more economic exist.
The drivers the more far-sighted can opt for insurance any risk frankly, so that they get the blankets insurance to any risk but at a price more accessible.
This form of convention means that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the amount of the sinister the customer pays will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher more the amount will be low", specifies Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of first Europa, Ombudsman insurance online.
Another option is the insurance to third enlarged, so that the customer assure protection to deal with the damage caused to third parties, but by for those caused on its own car.
Moreover, it would be covered against the flight, fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are minor of 25 years Essaies be careful and to avoid the sinister as far as possible, because it has implications for the subsidy, can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the basic tariff of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase of basic tariff.
"Subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase subsidies, "clarifies Noguera.
Beyond 25 years it becomes easier for drivers when a contract with insurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced through the experience gained.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose insurance any risk frankly.
"Normally young people can not benefit from the experience gained in advance after an accident', provides the director of the European company in Spain and would add that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the past' fear of amateur'.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children that it is better to negotiate a insurance to any risk, the Momento that its economic situation allows us to do so.
Marriages with children are viewed by insurers as people with the rate of accidents the weaker, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance to any risk frankly (can be of EUR 300), or insurance to third enlarged from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of subsidy.
"They conduct a more relaxed and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a greater proportion of exemptions", judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners insurance to any risk frankly is better (as it of EUR 150), or a Asurance to third enlarged when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that the motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver contingency claims, but also because it represents an important spending, and that is why it is vital to study properly insurance which suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to arrive at the elimination of final
The AC Milan and the Glasgow Celtic be measured next Tuesday to San Siro research from the point that their lack of achieving their objectives respective in the closure of the Champions League, since it serves to the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify.
The Italian - ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a match it in Portugal, while the Glasgow Celtic nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who gets Benfica which four, he going to.
These two matches d of the group will be played a week before the sixth day ends, since the AC Milan must argue the Semifinales of the World Cup clubs in Japan on 13 of this month to find a place for the final of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the match at no stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the result as expected, although the two teams try out successful, since the Italians will not speculate at home and the Glasgow Celtic by gaining knows that it would remain first and ensure better crossroads in the elimination of final.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be sufficient to classify if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not earn, but it can not computer only on this since with nine points the Games is for the Ukrainians, who have lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who have won (2-0) in the other duel direct.
Thus, the Milan try to poison the evening the Scottish, which have high hopes to classify for the elimination of final for the second time in the Champions League, having been defeated in the latest edition by an end of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
In the meantime the victory of' Rossoneri' triumph would only Shakhtar, if the Celtic lose, to classify for the elimination of final in order to continue the Champions League of UEFA.
And that is that the Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could achieve the third place with a victory.

The Scottish health authorities have said use 1161 people overseas, set up most of doctors and nurses.

The investigation has shown that the current procedures of controls on health authorities to Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.

The climate of Venus could prove to be the future of the earth.
Scientists have yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a planet pleasant to live.
The data from the vessel European in-orbit have shown that the world is certainly two times smaller than the earth, contrary to what it was thought before.
Venus is the world the closer to the land.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with the orbits similar, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists believe now that billions of years, Venus could have been conditions similar to those of the land, and may even have been habitable.
But the global warming effect due to the carbon dioxide, erosion air Dûe to solar radiation allied to a rotation slower Venus has led to a different kind of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and storms of flash and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of from express the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the future potential of the earth due to changes catastrophic climate.
Professor of physics department of Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of from express, said: we are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the earth, although the planets in even they are almost similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that there are billions of years, would have been Venus originally identical to land, can be even with a surface habitable.'

Still open to all
Mitt Romney said not match as candidate for the Presidency, in response to the questions of a slip of snow.
Despite this, the candidate for the Presidency Republicans have finally agreed to participate in the debate you tract, during which many ordinary voters registered with their questions, the volunteer for candidates.
On Wednesday evening 28 November, no questions has been as ridiculous as after another debate you tract, when a slip of Snow asked the Democrats their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, a candidate for the next elections.
We know on what criteria, producers of CNN, which Russia has the debate, have chosen the videoclips of you tract to show the candidates candidate.
But the first half a time of the debate, the longest addressing a single issue, was focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the subjects for the strong Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to telephone when they would understand things pleasant: the governed noted increases approval when the candidates expressed so gross.
The exchange the hardest and most along the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr Romney which is at the top of the list of important early elections of the Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that it was lazy about illegal immigration in his mandate as Mayor of New York.
It has attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to use of illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters have become particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be prepared to promote a' Amnésia "(offering illegal status regular and the opportunity to become citizen).
Candidates minors as Duncan hunter, a congressman California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, managed to deepen this.
Neither has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, can be due to the fact that they have begun to combat immigration before and more incisive than others.
In general, the candidate, at least on immigration, have the same views: borders more rigid, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This ally, the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears about the external world, promote the Republicans to forget, or to minimise the divisions between the libertarian and conservative Catholics.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues have been raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for the control of arms.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether to water down the nose should be regarded as a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidate believed in its entirety, the content of the Bible.
This has led Mr Giuliani to have the courage to say that the Bible is its White preferred, even if it is not on to believe in the history of Jonas and whales.
Another speaker has asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to its conservatism Christian long-standing - say that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, it started to laugh and said that Jesus is too smart to stand for election.
The human race Insolitement remains open to all.
The rise of Mr Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent enormous subsidies research carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, and the Sifflements during the debate on Wednesday.
These two there are émergés of nothing, because the two protected of the Party are unable to agree to decide who is the candidate most famous and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifying the party early and convincingly thanks to a message of success on the greatness close American leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of labour
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which sink; even if it resign, the situation will not change.
Given the trend of scandals British, it is not particularly lucrative.
No decorations sold or hotel bills Paris of politicians, no finger of up from outside the marital Sucé.
But that is that a revelation shows that a rich man of affair would masked for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than GBP 650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: a new battle which Gordon Brown would be well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister has lost ground in its draft election, insulting stupidly British intelligence declaring that opinion polls have not influenced its decision, and that he hoped on the contrary, offer a government compact and effective.
On the contrary, such Vince cable, the brilliant LEADER Liberal Democrat, has said that the terrifying Mr Brown has turned to Stalin to Mr bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the brink of crash showed a flaw directives and a judgment poor in emergencies.
The proposals inadequate for change in the tax code have caused a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million of personal data on the part of the authorities of taxes, has been a incredible cock-up administrative.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the military spending cuts: they have declared that be Defence Minister is for them, a part-time work.
At present, the suspicion of donations shady from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of labour (and its former head of the vigilance) have that they have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr Brown is heading inevitably to exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust in them, but leave in general their doubts of hand in a new government is in power.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister can not improve matters, or even govern for a long time, because it risk the suspension: the public administration is broken; the firms of Ministers are the balance sheet; the press research bad stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other leaders policy, it can not claim to be a beginning.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, it was his lieutenant higher.
The problems of Northern Rock and the data taxes, for example, are linked to the decisions of Mr Brown taken when he was Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, as the long investigation into the funds of the party "of the face value for the Members of the House of Lords', voters may think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that is in danger of Mr Brown is not so tragic that it sounds.
The blunders are not so monstrous as Members of the Party of the Tories believe.
As in Mr bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to implement the trends Stalinist Mr Brown, always in favour of a government reliable and slightly brutal.
The new scandal on donations policies is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a figure very particular, which compares its donations to charity, has said that it wanted no public recognition of its charity.
It can have a different opinion, but it is not for him to decide.
Laws against the anonymity of big Subventionneurs politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public has a right to know that contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said to be aware of the programmes of Mr Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, must therefore be questioned, as Mendlesohn, responsible for the collection of subsidies which had spoken of donations dubious in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is no evidence to suggest that it has been aware of these steps, even though most payments made has been made following its arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has half.
He quickly condemned the necessary legislative of his party, but it has not drawn attention to the fact that the power of decision is based on a device that it well acquainted, make use of a committee of inquiry into this matter made up of a bishop pension and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown, as must find a permanent President for the independent committee standards of public life, without leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the funding of political parties.
That would force the Labour Party, in a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead to give up his report with the special financial confederations; in short, a bitter pill for an advocate such Mr Brown.
But it should deal with some facts supporters.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to recover voters, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate a watertight integrity and strong powers.
Fraud of cards.
The crisis of mortgages Contaminerait-elle the American market credit cards?
When there are blood in water, it is natural that of fins artificially, Tourbillonner around.
Now that the US home market is going through a critical phase, predators are intended to the American market credit cards.
Analysts to home Goldman Sachs believe that the loss of credit card could reach $99 billion if the infection mortgages extends to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clear.
There are increases in rates of costs and insolvency, which measure the share of the balance sheet not recoverable or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its appropriations to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of the bearers.
It is too early to panic.
The costs and the insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax Agency, the rate of the insolvency of 3,89% of Troixième quarter is lower than almost a point in relation to its historical average.
The deterioration of rate is understandable in part by factors technical.
A change of laws in 2005 in the US, on the bankruptcy personal has caused a fall abrupt archives of bankruptcy, which in turn has caused huge losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore rates insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of loans should get worse.
The industry heralds disbursement rate fixed, which highlight the amount of debt monthly that consumers must resolve.
Sureté and trust in the capital of credit cards is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of finance structured.
Dennis Moroney of Towergroup, a society of research, has predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% over the last year.
The infection direct links between the crisis of mortgages and the market credit cards certainly exist: the consumers would prefer to increase their indebtedness now that the mortgage fair have disappeared.
But the card industry are more attention to the flow of species rather than the value of the heritage, and therefore the fall in home prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even bring benefits issuers of securities credit.
The premiums consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of borrowing; therefore, debt by credit card would become a priority to repay the first.
The card industry are able to respond much more rapidly than mortgage and with greater flexibility in such conditions of crisis, because they can change interest rates or alter the limits of Rédit.
This should in theory reduce the risk of an early resumption of actions.
"We are not going to we wake up one morning and re-evaluate all loans.' said Gary Perlin, the director of capital one.
If a disaster financial market credit cards is unlikely, there is a strong risk to have a reduction.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contraction in the credit market lead America to the recession, the industry will certainly face a future macabre.
Please pay careful attention to the fins Internet.
The British bankers argue guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers should go to express their roles in relation to fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr Andrew Fastow, have changed their declaration, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared innocent of seven accusations for alleged fraud collusively in 2000, committed by Fastow in a financial fraud secret to enrich the despite their employees.
They should be put before the Court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they are all found guilty of committing a fraud.
The three ex frameworks Greenwich Natwest, a subsidiary of the group plc Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous everywhere in Britain because of extradition procedures that have lasted two years.
In the US, their case is still outstanding question for this inquiry launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations that were imposed in 2002, have made it clear to Fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, called the "Three of Natwest' claim to be come to Houston in 2000, to organise a scenario fraudulent with Fastow and its ex right hand, Michael Kopper.
Natwest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a partner Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the orchestrator of many scenarios fraudulent, which has helped àtruquer procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank considered its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British are already its value.
A society controlled by Kopper bought the interests of the Bank of the subsidiary to GBP 1 million.
The bankers have paid $250 to Kopper as interest in this society.
According to the accused, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that society energy was have to pay $20 million to Greenwich Natwest for its actions in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers Fastow, and others.
According to the accusations, bankers would have reached $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the other would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, pled guilty Fastow for its active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The trio British was arrested after three months.
Fastow enduring a imprisonment of six years in prison in federal in Louisiana.
Kopper was imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of an endorsement of $1million each, which oblige them to live in the US during the trial.
Enron, before seventh largest society national bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting, could no longer hide its billion debt or even propose its speculation phoney as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion loss of value of the market and more than $2 billion loss to the pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the former President general Jeffrey skilling were sentenced last year, for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
The accusations against lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.

The second question is important because David Graveney, President of Sélectionneurs which was exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the Bureau of Hugh Morris, President Director-General of England, beginning to meet the application forms to become a national team, at least part time.
Anyone who will not happen to win the Dossard No 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
This is never easy to destroy what allows a man to arrive at the top of his profession while another is not going to happen, in addition to the lower level, sometimes by bad luck more than by lack of power.
It is not the only the cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to emerge Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee' tubby?'; both, new frameworks with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted, but there is room for a single one of them.
Who has the right to determine the level of just a Cricketeur unless it is given at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Has within a team, a Cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a Batteur must be lucky to reach the Cricketeur a day.
But capture the eyes of Sélecteurs is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson that seemed certain to play the first test, even if Stephen Harmison be said in full form and continued to leveraging to serve.
Anderson took 32 doors first-class on 33 towers in order to win a place.
Chris Tremlett has taken that 29 to the same average, but both of them have already experienced their moment of glory the greatest level and hope to offer.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who play at the stage Asgiriya, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it is little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth batty has played in each test and has succeeded in the first, with five doors and 40 towers useful, but it was Paul Collingwood, who fought to emerge, which has managed to become the Cricketeur important of the test, and that, despite the fact that its dual% marked against Australia in Australia can still be considered.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following a further discussion after the session today at the stage Asgiriya, will certainly their instincts Conservatives and promote more experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
For Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning the Innings of the test of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class against six for Bopara, which to 22ans is seven years younger and his excellent ranking the launch.
But Shah has only ten rounds in its two Innings in May against the Caribbean during the test Lord, its city of player of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the Sélectionneurs when Vaughan again in form, Réclama place for the next game, seems to have distressed its elk if obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing is fear on a ground cricket and it has exaggerated when it has recently scuppered on a 4 in a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It has postponed that of light wounds, was shocked, even if the first thing that he was to take its Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, its équipier who looked by far, and ask s'' it saw that?'
Bopara is by far the best Batteur, its rate Filante enables it to make services it will, and that it TAOs with confidence and solvency.
Choose human right is one thing, choose the right moment is another.
Is it can be the true art of selection?
I would be conducive to give a chance Bopara, but that does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the maps tea suggested, which will play this week ending.
The bus back people back to work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria has happened yesterday in Baghdad, dumping these exiles without money or without renewals visa, or others who hope that the city has found normality.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have far away from their homes.
Has the station bus Mansur, even before the arrival of Damascus 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of government official, the terminal was full of refugees of Syria and Jordan which are income by their means.
I have decided to go in Syria after they have killed several doctors to Baghdas' said Sabah Al-qubaisi Sunni, a doctor.
"I returned today because I saw on television and read in the newspapers what happened to Baghdâd and since the city is now safer.'
They say that "the Mahdi army is committing more crimes!' he said, referring to the militia Shia of militant Church Moqtada Al-Sadr, which has imposed on his men to remove at the moment.
Qassim Al Atwani, a teacher Shia 38 years of the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with its two children, because it could no longer renew its visa Syrian and because the regime prevents the Iraqi to work.
Its neighbours of Shia to Amariyah have called for the report that the militia helped by the US, has made it possible to drive Al Qaeda in the west of the capital, and have invited to return.
One of the new entrants of Jordan is the head of a tribe Sunni and Shia who has had to leave their homes in the north of Baghdâd because of a grenade attack after it has prompted the citizens to revolt against Al-Qaeda.
But it should return to combat.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have set up a militia anti Al-Qaeda to Sleikh, and that they needed to me and my boys.'
"That is why I returned today' said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years.
Many say that they have attracted by the calm growing of the capital since the US troops came, and in the view of further education of "groups of citizens involved' well armed and cooperating with the US military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say have been forced to return to cause of the problem of visa and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi have fled the years.
Salaam Al-samarrai, 51 years, the father of three children, has expressed the suspicion felt by all on visas for exiles that Nouri Al-Maliki, the Prime Minister Shia, which would have asked the Syrian Government to limit to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country because squads sectarian of death.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki Vienna in Syria and urges the government to give visas to Iraqi, forcing them to return to Iraq" said the pensioner Sunni.
"I can not be trusted to a government that supports the criminals who burnt my House when I am party'.
The fall of violence can be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out areas of Shia and vice versa, creating a place where tensions are minimal.
It is feared that a sudden flows of refugees increase again tensions sectarian and back the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The lowest federal state leads training Professionelle, and even conspicuous by the international orientation of its universities.
It is only in an area that a deficit hanging over the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I Exliqué yesterday for the 50 times to a Non-sarrois, that we are not French" - that is the slogan that the lowest federal state, by self-mockery, has for its 50th anniversary.
In this respect, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, a system which is placed in the fifth instructor training of the Institute for German economy in Cologne.
For example, already by tradition, colleges and universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded to Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
So far, the students have the chance to complete their studies by a double or triple a diploma.
Witness the Quotitée high 15.6% of foreign students.
The Saarland led by elsewhere also children in the country until the universities in many higher than the average - many of them without a degree of gymnasium.
"In Saarland, use of the system of vocational training," said Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training in Iw.
More of a young on five gets its way of studies in a vocational school, and the Saarland stands at more than seven points above the national average.
Also the opportunities of a combination of vocational training and academic are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double curricula is the second best of Germany.
Despite a practical training and a growing demand, the number of Diplomés engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education Sarrois forced colleges and universities to a campaign of marketing in matters of science of the engineer.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in schools general.", said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced in all the federal state of tests of comparison.
For that children are beginning to learn earlier, the last year of Crêche is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federal states copy.
Only of future studies of comparison can be if the performance of pupils are improving in a sustainable manner.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the actual pupils risk has shrunk from 29 to 20%.
All in all, however, the Saarland has not improved as well as other federal states.
The Bavarian do better.
And the general despite Sarrois, the knowledge of foreign languages are not measured by the PISA studies - one might otherwise gain points in this area.
Because the language of neighbour is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez rule the watches
In Venezuela, the case will soon ticking other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will go back the clock half an hour in the South American countries.
Chávez in the meantime becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Official Journal of the Venezuela's, owing to a new law, the case will be dealt with at least four and a half hours time universal.
In this way, the countries South America gets a time zone which does not exist in any other State of the world.
The Anti-American Chávez justified its position by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Moreover, Chávez announced on Wednesday (time local) the cessation of relations with neighbouring, Colombia, owing to a matter of hostages.
The nationalist left-wing announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remain President of Colombia, there maintain relations or with the head of state, or with the Colombian Government.
"I can, already only because of my dignity", said that Chávez look forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the country oil will have to vote by means of a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would strengthen significantly its power in the country.
The trigger element of this dispute was the decision to withdraw Uribe to Chávez the mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the rebels Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe would "typical" in the face of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new bell of mobile phone fact fury in the country: "pep Qué no you Callas" (why do you not Tais-tu) is the sentence that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It has been imposed by the King of Spain Juan Carlos which, the most recent Ibero-American Summit, was annoyed by the arrests constant left-wing populists and it has said to remain silent.
A reduction in wages threat Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic climate, according to a prognosis, a real Moins-value salary threat employees Germans this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the foundation Hans-böckler, employees should be expected in 2007 to a real reduction in their sheets pays compared with the previous year.
"The fault lies with the development of low wages, to the increase in the value added tax and increases food prices and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomic and research on the economy, the newspaper' Bildt ".
New burdens could also intervene on Assurance-chômage for the employee.
The Finance Minister peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper' Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung' that the planned reduction of the Assurance-chômage of 3.3% for the new year was certainly correct and sensible in the current situation.
However, the Agency national employment no longer has the right to be found in the embarrassment to ask the Federation of appropriations or financial aid, in the words of the politician of SPD.
It has been able to Tuesday that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons had led the inflation rate at its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices have risen by 3.0% from one year to the next.
Venus is the twin infernal of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus resembles more to land that what we thought until now: the European space probe "from express' has discovered flash into the atmosphere and Tourbillons of wind the Poles, similar to those who are in the winter on earth.
For almost three decades, the scientific imply that there are flash on Venus.
The European probe "from express' has demonstrated today - it has detected electromagnetic waves to the limits of the atmosphere: the flash on Venus break out to a height of around 56 kilometres of cloud in cloud, relates Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine Nature''.
According to the theory of the famous Cyprine, the Flash would have revealed life on earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus life: "if there were, it must have been a date very old of history", explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie institution" in Washington.
There should be today little things living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense that on earth, there is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the twin infernal of the land, but it remains a twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so to land in their masses and dimensions, was hit development also different, is the fundamental issue of the ESA mission.
The departure of "from express' in November 2005 was an important step in research Vénusienne, since no probe was under way for the Exploration of the world since the 1980s ten.
In the opinion of researchers, the most recent results of research that have now been presented in several articles of "nature' point out not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They show that the similarities with the land of our Planéte neighbouring are more that supposed at first sight.
And researchers have found, in addition to the Tourbillons of wind already known to the North Pole, an eddy clouds of the pole South, still much more quickly.
The phenomenon remind currents of air in the hemispheres land in winter, writing a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Di Astrofisica Spaziale E Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second Planéte of Sytème solar has almost the same mass that the earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost as great.
The Planéte called Star of the evening or in the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
It does move, however much more slowly on itself: one day Vénusien hard 243 days landowners.
Although Venus, with on the surface temperatures 460 degrees Celsius and pressure of 92 bar, hardly ever calls the earth, scientists imply that the two Planétes have set up in similar conditions.
On the two, water has accumulated and has remained on the land in the form of oceans, but has lost in the area on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has set itself on the ground in the form of, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the dispute parties on the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, it criticised the SPD because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sum the grand coalition to close the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not submit to the outside world a nation divided on this issue," said the Köhler Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid, although I respect for the differences between cultures' said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should retain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would hold a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced himself from the political traditional one China.
"China knows," said Köhler.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed its dissatisfaction with regard to the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained particularly of the "policy display" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, irritations virulent became felt in the reports Germano-chinois.
The Chinese government has not only having the German Finance Minister peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to reports of Spiegel, has also frozen dialogue said of strategy of foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now requires of Allemmande Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in office official, based Wen Jiabao and the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama show that it is trying to separate of China and Tibet other Regiones Tibetan, which also includes other provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Fighting street with the police, firing, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Everything must be done to that the dissatisfaction social in Germany not breaking out in the streets by violence, has demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Barricades which burn, of violent which derive on the police with guns hunting: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared a similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that an explosive social Contitue is not also at home and defuses in violence.
We must take this seriously, "he said the' Neue press" seemed to Hanover.
All young people not happen to cope with the rapid changes to the social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the common work already firmly to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would affect not only the integration of immigrants.
"Summits integration at the conferences on Islam, it shows already its initial success."
But it would be too early to an end warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that in the suburbs German, there is no problems sociological or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the conurbations Paris northern, young people had carried out serious street battles with the police during the last night.
In Toulouse also, cars and public buildings have burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German Government, that is what is necessary for the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned that the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not also explosive in France.
But it would remain, however, a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes the fact that the quota of unemployed among young people under the age of 25 years from immigration would be higher than the average.
We must primarily ensure more places to training.
Kolat insisted:' We must give young people a perspective'.
President communities Turkish added, however, that social control in the family had more take place in Germany in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want also destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must be careful."
We should quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training'.
In the meantime, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-bel, has remained very calm at night.
Police units are in place, a helicopter hovering the area with spotlight.
The authorities have expressed in office three arrests and a few cars and waste burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1 000 security forces assure the calm.
The police will as long as necessary, Annoncait the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of race.
In the Tuesday night, almost 80 policemen have been injured during the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
In the night following overcrowded, unrest in Toulouse.
The riots éclatèrent after an accident of movement in which two young had lost life Sunday.
According to the first elements of the public prosecutor's office, the police is not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The entry into stage utopian of Chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the substance and that there is nothing left to expect it.
In which country experiencing this Chancellor?
After his speech awkward in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor of content, it must be said: not here - not in the countries which should ultimately be governed by it.
The charge of too focus on policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel a sentence harsh and arrogant.
It is provincial, has said and has just shown that it does not want to understand what the criticism.
In Parliament, it has made visible for all to how this criticism was true.
There was no interest concrete or little feelings for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela is presented as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, which runs away in foreign policy and even there remains in the few.
For example: climate protection in this area, it welcomes again and again on the agreements Heiligendam, but does not say how the climate objectives must be achieved in our country.
Similarly, praise themselves - have so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it is clinging to formulas, that growth would affect the people.
By that it destroys his image as a pragmatist, which solved the problems instead to embellish the world.
But in the empire of cloud Angela, the problems of domestic policy are a rubbish marginal.
Poverty by children and concerns of low-wage workers?
There is still a few sentences accessories to this.
In this area is indicative of the number of times it made when it comes to slip child allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three Démarrages to make a sentence half.
It unsteady in ground unknown, when it becomes practical.
The branch attack
In the debate of Youtube candidates Republican presidential, the two favourite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard battle offensive and must now fear a candidate outsider.
The tension candidates breaks out already at first.
It would have been of New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants, reproach Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
It against for its part by heavy criticism: "I say that its own House was a haven for illegal immigrants responds Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts to have used immigrants without papers.
The candidate amount to the attack: as the basis Republican has also no favourite official, the eight presidential candidates for the use of debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The films fans 30 seconds that Internet users have sent via Youtube are little more than of Souffleurs.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have left Hitler coming to power', is launching John McCain to its candidate Ron Paul which is the only in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also is to lecture vigorously by the veterans Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn torture as the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation which appearance the drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture is in the reactions of the common Chamber of St. Petersburg in Florida.
That the conservative values are leased or that increases the future of taxes should be rejected, the applause into in the auditorium.
This is where are proving once again where the weaknesses of two favourite.
"I made a mistake at that time', explains Romney contrite and present his apologies to the basis and the public television for in 1994 yet been an advocate of abortion.
Giuliani instead going on in a crux conducts when they are called its opinion on interpretations figures of the Bible.
Musharraf exists for the first time in civil.
One day after its resignation as head of armed, human power of Pakistani Musharraf has been invested as President.
And eight years of domination by the army end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Television Pakistan has broadcast live the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has vowed to respect the Constitution and the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday it had submitted its burden of head of armed to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani and Etait and bowed to international pressure, in particular that of the United States.
Eight years after its seizure of power by a coup without bloodshed, the former general rule now for the first time as head of marital status.
By this withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another requirement central is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf stand the state of emergency, according to the chief prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and so will fulfil another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, that Musharraf had occupied after the introduction of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the re-election controversial of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime five soldiers were killed in the region tribal Northern Waziristan northern in an attack on a military convoy, and four other injured.
According to indications of the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are their return.
The Supergroupes Germany of the 1970s Rejouent: the three Members of the Group Harmonia have again taken their reassured in a concert in Berlin.
For their return are appeared recordings of their great success' live' 1974.
Even at that time, they were well best-known abroad.
The feeling planned happens then in the form of three gentlemen announced to the poster at night.
Everyone has a small `in front of him, his cable and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, throne in the Middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is kick from the left of Michael Rother, young 57 years and in possession of a computer mobile and Guitare.
On the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-joachim Roedelius, 73 years, curve on its reassured.
Everyone contributes to noise, among other even a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to too disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Group Harmonia plays of new assured few distress among the fans Krautrock.
It has the right to disclose here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name thinking in the collective memory of the MAGP, but under no circumstances as sustainable for that this group lack also painfully for 32 years.
But why the German would it not also have the right to celebrate its legends living seventy years?
All the more so because this misleadingly called "Krautrock" has increasingly liked in England and America that in the country of origin.
Lorque the music industry has awarded the price in 2003 echo the survivors of the group of Cologne can for their work in the Chamber, we have seen the faces MAGP German interrogators.
When the red hot Chile peppers have also thanked the groups the Düsseldorf and Neu! in the praise's surprise, no longer had limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother come on the scene of red hot Chile peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the Transfiguration into the unknown is the only.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed that two years and that during this period, the power to impact which has felt was weaker than this allocated subsequently by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name very promising cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the stage Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the Church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly Dépanné in Kraftwerk and had finally a name as Guitariste with Neu!, which was then perhaps the German group the more radical.
To 1973, Rother followed, however, the musicians of cluster in exile in the Fôrets of Weserbergland.
Here, in a former firm of Weser, a ruin of 16 century, they lived as members of communities fleeing from the city.
Less ideological that in the Community "Kommune, where I Roedelius had the right to be hurt as Nanny.
A life rather artistic how Spitzweg.
So-called was in the dustbin a flag of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for the art.
Many Retint Harmonia far from it.
The first Smiths is called "Musik von Harmonia", and this luxury''.
Because also calm and small that was music, suffered the group of misery material.
The harvest of dead wood to serve no alone in search of itself.
The CDs' live' 1974 which has just seem has been recorded in a together to Griessem before a public record of almost 50 head, as someone believes remember.
Rother issued at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius a requirement immoral.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother Atterit in the spheres of the esotericism and Assura its existence with Albums as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster is Réanima in the 1980s and has for more than success that Harmonia has ever had.
We must the Smiths live of Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as German contribution inherent in the music contemporary.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the film staff Roedelius.
The resurrection of physical Harmonia takes place at home cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidised publicly, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian cope is, the British, former punk and author of white pocket' Krautrock Sampler ".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. washed.
By which all of the fluctuation band of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with regard to the POP future.
Operations left behind by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno hangs in the Chamber in the mid sounds strange: "the only real music, you listen to the future'.
There are photographs showing producers with Harmonia in the piece of the firm.
Projections other photographs in black and white tools cable in bazaar serve to the training of the myth.
Before, the three veterans are again occupied to improvise.
But more and underpants of microphones to the high and the battery, to draw the instruments of sounds unbelievable thanks to the instruments to effects built oneself.
Today, the music electronic looks like the music electronic.
The three major Fignoleurs of technical.
To this even the choir of the House will only change.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, we coughing and whispers under the cloud of sounds, and we sings to a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah' emphatically.
Krautrock has always been a concept very English.
It has never comes to rock.
The roots have been less looked in the blues that in the conservation of music (can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of conventions artistic or social (cluster).
Anyone who shouts' 68 "has not completely wrong, and Harmonia also leaves is now more irritating by this now.
But what is the most itself will be covered in detail on the scene.
Where begins music and where end?
This can rap on the nerves of someone (?) or give of closes moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical.
With "the hunting party" and "peace murderous", two films again address the war in the Balkans.
But the two are unconvincing.
Is the projects are based too much on the action and on the exchange of firing senseless is on the contrary they are too Larmoyants.
Here, even Richard Gere in "the hunting party" can not help.
The good news of all: of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the hinterland as dismal of the war in Bosnia, that the player Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the best man of the 1980s, because too many roles Gentillets and Futils in films to feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism has pleased the desire to be.
Today Richard Gere suddenly the most important argument to look after all, "the hunting party" - when the hunter becomes the driven out (why films today should also be long and confused that collective agreements of drivers of locomotives?)
It gives a magnificent representation full of Clins of an eye: basically its character to postpone war Simon hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and industry films were not as kind: a man who has the best of times behind him for a long time, but which, even as a monument in ruins to its decline, however, has kept remains visible of its former charm.
But despite this asset, "the hunting party' continues together with production German" peace murderous ", beyond this week, following never-ending films failed on the war in the Balkans.
"Peace murderous" can be done quickly the trial: the film talk of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), save a Serbian of freelance Kosovars, in which one of the two quickly fall in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are for once not presented as the only causes of all evil, this film also flat that a Téléfilm is lost far too quickly in the action and exchanges of firing senseless.
This remains a sort of "alarm for Cobra 11' without motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "the hunting party", why basically there has never been a true good film on the war in the Balkans.
The history of the three reporters American war, who determine for trail upwards war criminal "The Fox', could have perhaps become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both both Richard wrote), on another occasion a new" Apocalypse Now ".
Because the stories are the same way of striking: two male will in small team in the forest, to do something that the military can not do and for the two male, this is becoming a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the "hunting party" is that it leaves simply not Simon hunt be the cynical deserted with a heart, as presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must give it also an adventure romantic with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then the "hunting party' becomes definitively bad, when the delay, in the area of the last five minutes, by a process speeded up, manages to NATO, the CIA and all the premium hunters of the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and allow for a fair revenge the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so bad that we should seize the International Court in The Hague of crime against the logical film.
In this case, the film has a concern human too deep.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and it suspect the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreement) not lead hunting fairly intensive because of political agreements secret.
But the well-intentioned and bad are this time so that a similar famous Poême of Brecht comes to the idea.
That talking about a mask wooden a demon Asian working on the table of Poête: "compassionate, I see no front inflated, as is clear: Fatiguant to be bad."
The films such as "the hunting party" have exactly such head Tumescentes, but that implies the Fatiguant to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were major flops.
We can add: there has never been a good films on South Africa.
What is true whenever: when a star lagging behind on a trouble spot or on a minefield, it out then something like' Rangoon "with Patricia Arquette," Jenseits go Grenzen "with Angelina beautiful or'' Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo Dicaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close over time.
In any case, decades have always gone before Hollywood can turn a good film on the Holocaust with "the list of".
Certain films must still mature - those who are today of traditional works on Vietnam "the deer hunter", "Apocalypse Now' or' stop metal Jackett" have by no means been celebrate unanimously to their time as heads of work.
But perhaps we know today also simply too much on conflicts of the world, where each massacre is in direct on two screens at the same time, at home
And this pleased to Scénaristes the lack of sensitivity they need to tell fine stories.
"To be or not to be" or "the dictator" are in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not know yet how the Nazi regime dominated really.
Perhaps we should not attempt to be good when we want to do good Flims.
Perhaps we must have their eyes artistic sarcastic and farther of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When has asked on the parallel between its novel historic "dictionary of Lemprière' and the war in the Balkans, he replied:' It is up to the fact that certain things change never".
"The big cities will always be appallingly dangerous, men will always be murdered a Facon Horrifiante and war always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust harvest criticism for the cancellation of traditions.
The fall in the Mayor of with the application of Hamburg for the summer Olympics met in politics and economics to of fierce criticism.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the brink of water.
But von Beust appeal to the realistic when assessing opportunities.
The main director of the Chamber of Commerce to Hamburg, Hans-jörg Schmidt-trenz, described on Wednesday abandoning as "bad for the local economy'.
Recently, no other project has made so many forces of motivation in the city that the idea of traditions.
"Without this objective, the momentum Politico-sportif could not have been maintained in the same measures'.
Schmidt-trenz invite the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another agenda changed".
The Mayor Ole von Beust not on Wednesday at its previous declarations, according to which the ambitions Olympic Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2000/2028.
"It is not Hamburg which decides to an application to the traditions, but the Federation German Olympic sport' said von Beust to Welt online.
It refers to the decision expected of the Federation of sport at the beginning of December, on the application of Munich for the winter games of 2018.
This means preference for us, that, in the time that we anticipated until 2000/2028 so far, we will have no chance. "
However, the dream does not belong to the past, once said von Beust.
The sports federation of Hamburg (Hsb) lamented the statements of Beust.
This would be the impression given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to ignore an opportunity, in ground projects already now", said on Wednesday President of Hsb Günter Ploß.
Abandoning the application would be more in contradiction with the statements by the head of the Senate on the occasion of reception in the plenary assembly of the Federation of German universities of sport.
There, von Beust would have described the application of Hamburg to Universiades of 2015 as being "not a substitute" the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of universities of sport initially in the past weeks nominated Hamburg as candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor has criticized the Senate not to have used this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of small Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it has played the map of traditions and ruled out the construction of housing," said the delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the small Grasbrook a plan integrated into the traditions and subsequent uses of housing, the CDU would have relied solely on the "factor event".
The application for the Summer Olympics in 2012 for its part would have raised in Hamburg much enthusiasm.
Hamburg had however broken against Leipzig.
It is not the funds Warhols.
That linking the concepts Sweden and cash in wood, believe in Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, funds wooden manufactured in Sweden throwing a shadow on the list of works of Warhol.
Many of the ninety Brillo-boxs' type Stockholm' catalogued there are of counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen'' has questioned the authenticity of a few months ago Brillo-boxs year of 1968 Andy Warhol, research internal of Moderna Museet Stockholm today lead to a result Désenchanteur: the six "Brillo-boxes', including the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave in 1995 to Moderna Museet, are copies - and many of the other hundreds of Brillo-boxen' type Stockholm", circulating on the international market in the art.
History is fairly, a chain disconcerting production artistic and Curatoriques.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-boxes", funds wooden painted, based on the design of Rouge-bleu-blanc cards soap powder Brillo''.
An exhibition of his work Moderna Museet presented in 1968, with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of funds Brillo made of card: they did not originate (for financial reasons) by Warhol, but had been delivered directly to the factory Cartonnage Brillo.
It was not of works of art, but rather of their models, of samples of exposure.
At the same time, Warhol had authorised in 1968 to produce a few coffers wooden Brillo in Sweden, which were not at Moderna Museet.
Witness the time to speak today about 15 coffers wooden who at the time would be inflows right in the history of the art and auctions, as Brillo-boxes original of Andy Wahrol allowed, with the Appelation' type Stockholm ".
Some of them have achieved in the auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed, only about a hundred coffers wooden had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then pass.
In truth, the 105 funds Hultén have been produced in Malmö in 1990, only to exposure to the St Petersburg.
At that point, Warhol was already death for three years.
Lars Byström, leader of the Conservative Moderna Museet, has examined, in addition to six Brillo-boxes museum, three other of private collections Suedoises, including two have been Confectionnées in Stockholm in 1968: their panels Stratifiés were first printed and Poncés, then it has applied with a them of oil paint white.
The texture copies which date back to 1990 reveals that the paint has been directly applied without layer on the panels Stratifiés, by means of a scroll of paint more - it is not a oil paint, but a Acrylique.
"These funds have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from the list of official Brillo-boxes of Andy Warhol" suggests, the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "if the' Andy Warhol art authentication board' in New York is not just another decision, the Moderna Museet classified the six coffers in its collection as copies / material exposure."
Already in July the authentication board has of course, announced that it into on the "serious accusations' which will be raised in the case of funds soap powder.
But since we psychotic there a Inéxorable silence.
