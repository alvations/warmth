On Sunday, said agency Reuters Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank House.

According to economists, it should be notification that the approval of a rescue plan is the first important psychological factor for reviving the financial markets. 
But then there is "sobered" by the complexity of mechanisms, such help markets achieve in practice.

The plan envisages also with the help of the homeowners who have problems with repayments. 
Government should negotiate a new lease payments for mortgages to purchase, in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for borrowers and enable them to be able to leave their homes. 
Marek: Psychological support 
The proposed plan is in accordance with Patria Finance chief economist David Marek good idea, very difficult but its implementation. 
"And because it does not know what mechanism and at what price, the problem will be an asset purchase. 
This will determine how to divide among themselves the loss of the financial sector and the government, "he said this week the server iHNed.cz Marek. 
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, according to Mark is not so significant. 
"More importantly is to have this týdenkongresmani agreed to support the plan and that it hallow, as soon as possible to go. 
That psychological importance of that event for approval, is currently the most important, "stressed Mark. 
Duel at odds: MP3 players against mobilům. 
Advice on how to choose 
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, any MP3 player can not call. 
It seems clear that it is better to buy a phone. 
Yet there are enough reasons to have a man took a stand-alone player. 
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the demands of future owners. 
Probably hard to take home a top expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc. 
Both these musical products for the LP plates and not a qualitative point of view for even there is no objective reason. 
Need But if your shelves Vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues, probably on a turntable at least to eat. 
It's the same with music on the move, a music compact, simply - music in MP3. 
And there are price and quality categories. 
For someone may be unacceptable to spend on player eight thousand crowns, as well as Pink Floyd fan about hard zkousne headphones for twenty Kc from the market. 
Two extremes between which is enough space for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
Decided by the endurance of batteries 
Some top music players can cope with much more than just playing music, but what most handset or by accident. 
No current device is not as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and esemeskování, can play music and video, both record, has the better, the worse the camera and be able to navigate well. 
And when we take into account the smartphone and communicators, you'll have in my pocket and a small computer. 
It is a small miracle, you can not grill, no refrigerator, no TV and no nevyfotografuje. 
The universality of mobile phone offers and disadvantages. 
The more functions on mobile phone use, the sooner you indicator on the display sends a charger. 
And playing music is one of the biggest energy glutton. 
Few mobile phone can play music for more than ten twelve hours, most of it is much less. 
In this regard, the music player (especially the simplest) significantly more powerful. 
For low-priced handset models, therefore, note that more than a few hours you will not play. 
If you still do it every now and then you call, make you work for security in yet another charger - to pay for expensive equipment. 
In the case of MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worst lasts at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge. 
Another problem occurs when recording music to mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of equipment has a universal plug USB, and also not each of them can be directly connected to your computer without special software. 
Of course, you can record music directly to a memory card, but Few card reader, without a reduction in order to miniature memory cards, which are used in Mobile. 
For players with some exceptions (iPod), no special software required. 
Just fill the music from your computer via USB. 
Most handset and players can no longer create its own music library sorted by name, title album, genre or evaluation of the user. 
Some devices display only tree of directories like the Explorer in Windows, and some they can do both (iRIVER, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phone operating system). 
Players are easier to operate mobile phones more skilled 
When selecting a particular device is zajímejte in particular the stamina battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, as well as comfort control. 
If you mainly background music and if you listen to it every day just to be in short tram, you just any cell phone that plays MP3. 
Which can no longer really almost any mobile phone. 
Do not have too monitor the cell phone or music player formats can. 
MP3 to deal with all and the vast majority of music that you will receive will be in this format. 
Is one of the most widespread and apart from the overwhelming majority of devices can handle the music in WMA. 
Less occurs AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods). 
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
Just visit the Internet via mobile operator of the site (or another) and a song or album you buy. 
This service would no longer alone may be powerful argument for the acquisition of mobile music. 
Unfortunately, the operators offer is lousy and is limited mostly to rychlokvašené radio hits. 
Prices also are low. 
Generally, however, that this method of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) in the future opanuje music industry. 
Most people carry a cell phone with you. 
Whenever you taste something you listen to, a cell phone in my pocket nahmatáte, while the MP3 player is left at home. 
However, still depends on whether or not it also always wear headsets or hands-free wire. 
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which is almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players. 
Probably the greatest benefit of music for many handset will cost. 
These are normally the cheapest under three thousand. 
For the three and four thousand crowns already take a very decent Walkman. 
But mostly you will restrict output in the absence of normal headphones. 
The best and technically nejvybavenější phones is 3.5 mm jack for normal headphones is within fifteen thousand. 
The advantage of players back, inter alia, easy operation. 
These simple - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can handle any real control. 
Minimum functions similar operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or record player is obvious. 
There is a conflict in the form of mistake is on the mobile Internet and the giant account for data transmission. 
After which the device works 
Even the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally slot to exchange cards (type M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even with dokoupením of the cards come in two thousand crowns. 
Take care, however. 
The basic models are supported only card with a maximum capacity of 2 gigabytes. 
Only the most can cope is 8 GB paměťovkami. 
If you already have a cell phone and you can even buy a cheap MP3 player, Sahni by Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, EMGETON or iriveru. 
According to capacity (up to 2 GB) do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you are a demanding audience rather sáhněte for specialized Mobile - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and some Samsung). 
These devices have separate buttons for MP3 and comfort of the operator to close a stand-alone MP3 players. 
Far in the field of Sony Ericsson, the Walkman series of mobile phones have the same user interface as a separately sold MP3 players. 
The same service and at the same price category than four thousand crowns, but with greater storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and the dwell time of the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), you do MP3 players from the aforementioned brands. 
The first virtual operator arrives in the Czech Republic already this year. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively mature, and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Yet here we are missing something - a virtual operator, which forced the classic cheap. 
Maybe not miss a long time. 
The fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive ever in Europe, we Mobil.cz wrote it very much. 
After all confirmed to the CTO, who pointed out that the price of SMS is with us more than in the rest of the Union. 
After the last steps the European Commission's regulation of roaming charges and maybe there is a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be an SMS from abroad cheaper than at home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are held in Europe so far? 
The answer is simple, lack of competition that would really like to go to war. 
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, we have a three mobile telephony and high penetration of over 100%. 
Mobile phone operators on the other hand, we žehrají to the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
In this they are often přizvukuje and President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTO) Pavel Dvorak, who in the past on several occasions that the next operator in the Czech Republic is the place. 
It is probably true that the typical operator with its own networks, it too seems to have chances (after all, I would probably hardly looked frequency). 
But there is one more option - a virtual operator. 
On the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has brought a significant reduction in prices, which then had to react and traditional operators. 
In doing so, before entering pike as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market heard in the UK as a similar vote in our country. 
Have been found but that the space for such operators, and can be really successful. 
Moreover, the examples do not have to walk too far. 
In February this year, we let you know about the start Mobilking virtual operator in Poland. 
For a mere half-year is the operator succeeded to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator. 
In doing so, for Mobilkingem is a financial group Penta, which owns the Czech Republic, inter alia, for: fona. 
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on much more specific audience. 
In order to function effectively, they simply had far fewer customers than classical operator. 
Entail a relatively high cost of the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world to the virtual operators usually profile as a low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by narrower range of services. 
So be Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as shown by the example of Mobilkingu in Poland, may be quite a good bet to pull even neotřelou audience. 
The operator has focused specifically on men. 
"Administrative guys elect Mobilking - operator, which they like and which can trust," says CEO David Seibertz Mobile Entertainment Company, operating in this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say whether the similar concept as in Poland could catch among us. 
Doubts Spokesman Miroslav Vodafone Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small segment of the approach on which most virtual operators is based. 
Moreover, it is in terms of supply of services is relatively saturated." 
In the Czech Republic without a chance to say mobile operators 
But it seems almost certain that in the Czech Republic as a virtual mobile operator will, not to Mobilking. 
"The expansion of this successful project we speak, in the Czech Republic but negotiations look too promising. 
Rather, it will start Mobilkingu in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview Mobil.cz John Studničková, spokesperson financial group Penta. 
Indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic strongly supportive of this idea are not. 
Quite on the contrary, is trying to do everything so that no potential competitor did not. 
Interest in the launch of the virtual mobile operator is no longer neta group GTS Novera, which would like to make a further step to become a real competitor Telefóniky O2 in the field of corporate customers. 
"We have a great interest in what we can offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner the better. 
This we have repeatedly discussed the possibility of all Czech mobile operators. 
With some of them we are in negotiations forward, "says spokesperson Paul kaidl group. 
Perhaps, therefore, glittering for better times. 
The unofficial information, it appears that the first virtual operator, we should wait no longer possible to the end year. 
In the meantime, but the emergence of accompanying the impenetrable wall of silence. 
"At the moment I do not think that is on the Czech market space for a full-featured virtual operator. 
The Czech market is compared to other markets very specific. 
So far, we addressed any entity with a complex and serious project in this area, "said in its statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil hornet from the press department Telefóniky O2. 
The specificity of the Czech market, claiming other operators. 
Spokesperson T-Mobile Martina Kemrová supplies in rare agreement with the expression of O2: "So far our attention no viable and mutually beneficial commercial project, which would make it possible to build." 
He adds: "The network of T-Mobile until the end of the year hardly a virtual operator appear. 
At this point I would like to have on the table a specific agreement in order to be considered in the short term. " 
Vodafone focused its attention more to meet the requirements of its own 3G licenses. 
Miroslav Čepický to say:" negotiations with potential virtual operators we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure. 
Malaysia to consider in terms of customers for most. 
Vodafone's main strategies in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with one hand 
operators. The procedure mobile operators can easily understand the entry of additional operators would mean an increase in competition, led by a drop in prices and thus the decline in their profits. 
Why facilitate the emergence of a competitor? 
The fact that operators when something is, able to pull together, indicating the emergence of a scramble around the U: fona. 
Probably the biggest pressure came to the CTO at the time of this U: fona from T-Mobile. 
Suggests that publicly available information from websites CTO. 
Now, however, the U: fon useful as an argument why it should not be a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová the observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile market, moreover, has recently been exacerbated by the entry into force of the fourth mobile operator on the market. 
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of additional players by him and on his services, placed high demands . 
In view of this the mobile operators but directly striking a total lack of Czech regulatory authorities. 
This is only the position of CTO, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have jurisdiction to interfere in the competition. 
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC). 
But that the whole issue delivered his typical position. 
"Enter the virtual operator at the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract took place between the mobile operator and a virtual operator leasing the necessary infrastructure. 
No such contract has not been concluded yet, as most offer potential for classic operators did not sufficiently interesting, "he said in response to our question of the Christian Cottage of the External Relations Department Office. 
Since the representatives of operators formulated as follows comments perhaps not surprising. 
From the Office which is to represent the interests of consumers and ensure, among other things, and that no misuse of his position in the market, it is more than disquieting. 
Especially when Christian Cottage adds: "Abroad, where the virtual operators currently operate, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services." 
But perhaps the pressure to correct the functioning of the market and the fall in prices does not belong to the interests of OPC. 
The shocking truth, the whole case is only touching the interplay of three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question of whether the case really just a coincidence, is offered entirely alone. 
As well as exactly the same price of petrol at service stations is certainly a chance and work hard in competition. 
"The Office in this matter did not find evidence of anticompetitive behavior, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way. 
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, no corresponding increase in responsibility for their actions in the market. 
The tools to open the market for mobile virtual operators probably meet the telecommunications regulator, "said in its statement Cottage. 
Interpretation of market dominance is one of many contentious points. 
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared CTO, under which telecommunications competition from the perspective of a single market. 
To this market and of course none of the Czech operator has a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offered a different view - to a virtual operator is always a need for the consent of the network operator. 
A mobile operator - has logically - on its network monopoly. 
So in a certain segment must necessarily be dominant. 
Even if that argument but does not permit, the Office should be at least warn that the three mobile operators are progressing remarkably similar. 
In doing so, a number of complaints of candidates (including that GTS Novera) show that in the treatment of all operators faced with very similar obstacles. 
Svalování responsibility for the CTO is the Telecommunications relatively normal trick, which gives the Office of the hands off the matter. 
We met with him already in several similar cases. 
Unfortunately, until recently adopted an amendment to the telecommunications law is the extension of powers to the CTO of competition in telecommunications failure to enforce, although a number of experts from the promised improvement in the situation. 
To be represented by OPC to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere. 
It really is, when no one is 
In doing so, ignored the operation akin to pseudovirtuálních operators, which in the Czech mobile networks there are several. 
These are companies issuing their own price lists mobile telephony services, which are public but only partially. 
Usually has the Company engaged in multilevel marketing. 
Its own mobile telephony services to be offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, STARLIFE and many others. 
Price lists these firms are usually given only to the elect. 
Charm lies in the fact that the company against the operator acts as a standard business customer who purchases a large number of SIM cards. 
As a major customer will receive a special price (and others) offer. 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators like přeprodej prohibited. 
"If the cases of which you speak, it could be a breach of contractual conditions, which we discussed and could result in termination of cooperation with the companies' response to our query on this issue Martina Kemrová. 
But it is quite unlikely that the similar activity to the responsible people from the mobile operators nedonesla. 
Especially in the case of the three companies may be a thousand customers. 
None of the operators are taking this action does not prevent. 
The activities of these companies have had significant gains while - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way endanger their own marketing official. 
Highlights of the possible problems Miroslav Čepický: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies only a negligible percentage of customers. 
In addition, you must accept that the SIM card in the phone is not led by their name, it can not therefore have full as ordinary customers of mobile operators. " 
This should nevertheless CTO at least strange. 
Moreover, opens another question for OPC. 
If mobile operators přivírají over a similar procedure eyes, why block the creation of a virtual operator? 
That said, the OPC is to detect similar activity relatively strong powers, and unless we want to, it may not be satisfied with an explanation of operators that do not have anything that idea, and their business conditions to prohibit. 
Where we will not be the most 
As the text fell several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has brought zaznamenatelný fall in prices for services. 
In doing so, virtually all countries where virtual operators are established, they tried to traditional operators of the emergence of more or less defend. 
They used the arguments were almost identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
In developed countries, but in those moments hit regulatory authorities to protect not interests of mobile operators, but their customers. 
Whether formal or informal arrangements reached the pressure that came first virtual operator, and it is nabalovali others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities throughout the case reverses like a hot potato. 
From our experience, we can not escape the impression that ambiguity in their competence in these cases, more than suitable. 
But throw in Flint rye. 
If the background information correct and virtual operator with us really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be set in motion again. 
If any of the operators creation of a virtual mobile operator admitted hardly be able to remain indifferent to the Office rejection (discrimination) of other candidates. 
And we need to stop calling irritant than in the rest of Europe.

Russia wanted the United States after the referendum 
Sudetští Germans in 1945 to seek the inclusion of Šumava to the United States. 
Goes to the letter, which is stored in the collections of South scientific libraries. 
When we can not be part of Germany or Austria, to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such wishes are reportedly in 1945 addressed a group of Sudeten Germans at the President of the United States. 
Due to, inter alia, in a letter to be kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of South scientific libraries. 
Germans from Cesky Krumlov requested in a letter to the American president to not refund "Šumava county" - Hitler seized on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia. 
"We correct the situation and we have to be really sure of the words that come to the U.S. unit of German territory rather than as oppressors and enemies but as liberators," he wrote in the letter, signed by "People, which lies at the heart of Šumava destiny." 
Since connection to Czechoslovakia reportedly gives sudetským Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - hope to the brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, ask the authors of the letter the American president to take over the Šumava protectorate for the present and eternal time. 
"We can not believe that you, regardless of the views of a quarter million inhabitants of that territory awarded to a foreign country to us, which dispels the utiskuje and minorities, and nothing, nothing Zhol has not contributed to the victory of the Allies," he wrote in the letter.

To the conscience to feel especially young drivers, motorkářům, pedestrians and also professional drivers. 
And in a spot? 
Especially human stories that attack on the emotions. 
And evidenced by the "bloody" the campaign slogan: 
Don 't - pay! 
The word "don 't' is written in capital letters on espézetce. 
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay". 
This is symbolizing that the man may be a second-mindedness to pay their own life. 
Viewers will be spots "haunt" until 2010. 
The Ministry is inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see the pictures with a drastic images of casualties. 
Promises that, to reduce accidents and deaths on Czech roads. 
Spots prepared agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip the driver 
"The driver pays system carrots and sticks. 
Sugar for them is that if, for example, going to red, and save time. 
Whip is the threat of fines or an accident. 
Drivers must be reminded risk, "says psychologist transport Na Homolce Martin Kořán. 
And therefore the need for information campaigns in the press and especially the negative ads, refers to a psychologist.

"Where is installed static signs warning against the dangers are likely to soon blends into the surroundings and drivers it will not be paid," pointed out Kořán. 
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace 
Interim Chairman of the Government of Israel Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, thus Předjordánska, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
Did so in an interview, which on Monday carried a diary Jediot Achronot. 
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, even if not all," Olmert told the newspaper. 
"Retain a certain percentage of these territories, but Palestinians will have to cede a similar percentage of (Israeli territory), because without peace is not," he added. 
Admitted that any recovery will include the East Jerusalem. 
"Whoever wants to safety in Jerusalem and in particular wants to make tractors or bulldozers ran over his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said in Filling the two July attacks in the city, in Several people have been killed and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the prime minister will need to find a "special solution for the temple Mount, sacred and historic places, which lies within the Old Town.

It will not work," stressed further. 
Leaving the Golan Heights 
Olmert has called for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is inherent in his condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
But it would also require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"I'm not suggesting make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," pointed out. 
"Syrians, we know what will be required to relinquish to obtain Golan. 
They will have to abandon their current relation to Iran, they will have to abandon its relationship with the (Shiite movement) Hezbollah, they will have to waive the continuous support offered by the terrorism (Shiite movement) Hamas (terrorist network) al-Qaida and jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "stated the Prime Minister. 
Questions after an accident: they are illegal steward on the bus? 
The law is not know, go in the coach may not 
In connection with the tragic bus accident near the Student Agency Italian Padua raised the question of whether the steward and passengers can ride for the move after the bus. 
"If we would like to formally and strictly abided by the law, the activity is steward in violation of the law on road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka. 
Accident, which last week lost twenty-two year old stewardess, probably caused by a goods vehicle driver that the bus zkřížil way. 
Girl at that time unfortunately sat next to the driver, at least safe place in the car, although it has reserved a two other places. 
However, the bus crash, or brake sharply, and when the steward roznáší coffee and newspapers. 
Role to whether the bus under a technical license equipped with points standing. 
If the bus is not approved, the passengers sit. 
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have space for parking, which Aktuálně.cz confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jančura. 
"Thus we solve the ministry and initially prevented the movement of passengers. 
Finally it came, and we are invoking the fact that passengers may go after running to the bathroom, where they have their chair," said their opinion. 
Law steward knows 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation does not address this role. 
No legislation, however, neither the carrier does not provide services. 
Law on road transport only knows the term crew vehicle, its rights and obligations does not, "he adds less clearly spokesman Hanzelka. 
Head of the operation of road vehicles Ministry of Transport Joseph Pokorny on the other hand, maintain that the law treats the issue sufficiently. 
" Does it matter whether the bus regarding allowed to stand. 
Thus it ends, "he says. 
Buses divided into the city, where parking space and limited the maximum speed, distance to points in the standing with the higher the speed limit and no remote places for parking with a maximum authorized speed and seats equipped with safety belts. 
As in aircraft, says expert 
BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Horin moving stewards on board the bus to see a major problem. 
"When smooth ride much danger, the situation can be compared to service aircraft. 
Here it is not certain when the turbulence and the stewardess can hit in the head. " 
" However, if the bus sharply zabrzdil, of course, applies physical laws. 
As well as in urban bus or tram. 
Safety stewards have to deal with the carrier internal regulations, "he says, and also meant, in terms of the Act is the issue unresolved. 
Jančura is willing to cancel the service 
Student Agency offers services stewards as the only bus carrier. 
Employs them to two hundred. 
Director or after the accident is not their profession at risk. 
"Once but takes the impression that it is risky profession stewards and cancel it. 
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on taking. 
Saved by including costs," he says. 
As a security interest in the absence of stewards moved in their cars Director of Asian Alexey Litvin, which operates a fraction of lines in comparison with the SA. 
"We do not have air-hostess, to stand against it from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end a fatal accident," he said less than a year for Týden.cz. 
It has become a tremendous tragedy 
Regular service in an accident in Naples died young hostess of the Pilsen Region, which has worked for two years. 
Slovenian truck swerved likely without the use of the direction of a lane and blocked the way the bus. 
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, Zavadil him, however, the right front part. 
That was sold two seats set aside for rest stewards, Jančura rejects. 
"This is not the place for long-distance flights can book are blocked." 
The company intends to sue the truck driver. 
In compensation the family girls agency will wait for the decree of the court, but financial compensation as well as expected by the culprit. 
Change the law? 
The sight 
Refinement of movement stewards on board the bus could bring change the law, which a year working třicetičlenná Expert Group Ministry of Transport. 
"For any particular conclusion, however, did not. 
Buses or too does not address, rather points system, the maximum speed on the highway and use mobile phones while driving," says expert Horin. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not work for a stewards what would fundamentally threatened the safety of passengers," spokesman Hanzelka concluded that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and work safety authorities. 
Düsseldorf Frankfurt hope is 
Great words in the letter to the board of the bank WestLB employees missing. 
The merger of the düsseldorfské monetary institutions in Frankfurt Deka-Bank a "central financial institutions group of savings banks to trade in the capital markets," tells us in the letter, which the public received on Monday. 
WestLB according to a letter to this transaction will bring "a set of competencies" to ensure the long-term yields. 
And ever said such a merger could be a decisive impetus to further pooling in the sector Landesbanken. 
Such texts arise when the board wants in the troubled period demonstrate the ability to act. 
Unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure. 
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the supervision of financial services, the communications Provincial Government in North Rhine-Westphalia, that it is time to find a solution for the future, it is still fresh. 
The link between the Deka-Bank, which customers savings banks known for its investment funds, and WestLB, whether it be of any kind, however, speak long time - even on the Frankfurt side. 
Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas in the presentation of half-yearly results at the end of August had heard that the merger of its banking house of Mainzer Landstraße with one of the Landesbanken, such as bank Helaba, or WestLB, sees no sense. 
The Management Board Deka-Bank, for which the cost of one half Landesbank second and savings associations, however, authorized the Board of leadership talks with WestLB on joint business activities. 
There might be a business on the capital market or in part. 
Talks, however, only just begun, point financiers. 
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, in the context of consolidation in the sector Savings speak for the first time. 
In 2003, it appeared momentarily that it could lead to a merger Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz as the bank Helaba. 
For this trojspolku ultimately nothing. 
Shortly after the merger plans were given to the public, expressed the hesenská provincial government against the participation of the bank Helaba. 
Neither the two remaining banking houses to nespojily. 
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead received Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg of Stuttgart. 
Despite repeatedly appeared on the merger speculation Deka-Bank, the earth banks. 
More recently, however, to speculation about its financial house conjunction with other negatively expressed Günther Merl, Chairman of the bank Helaba. 
However, it seems that no matter uzrává belief that the convergence of various public sector banks is a necessity. 
Now after the elections to the Regional Assembly in Bavaria would be the first to begin to draw connections BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
This is not just for Helaba good news. 
Where should the pressure for further mergers increase, gradually comes to the possible partners for such a connection. 
In the south would play only second fiddle, even though the financial crisis now facing much better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
Connections with WestLB again early prohibit Association savings and giro banks Hessen-Thüringen, which has Helaba pětaosmdesátiprocentní share. 
There would be no more than accounted Nord LB. 
Geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem. 
On the other hand, regards the question of how much the match business models of individual institutions. 
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of how business model should be ensured the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German association of savings banks and giro bank has not explain. 
Everything could also end up distribution WestLB, which in this institution, of course, nobody. 
Therefore, it is also in a letter to the local Board of talks that seeks to "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house. 
Whether and how it can be combined with linking the various components of the Deka-Bank, show time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "weekend in Italy" 
For Elena is the first time, Luc for the third or fourth time. 
But this time there will be Elena as his girlfriend, and said everything will be different, he says. 
For them, in pětilitrového barrel mark Kaiser, is stronger Beard and two hundred tourists to the Oktoberfest shows how deep tones can give his throat. 
Elena Luc pleskne first and then kiss him. 
Verona to come from Bologna. 
From here, from the bus station parking lot next to Puorta Nuova, will come out this evening at 23.45 four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", the anticipated arrival of 6.30. 
Three buses occupy mainly Italians, one bus ride only Brazilians. 
In one corner of the car park you have these Jihoameričané sing with his flag at night it celebrated. 
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it is nothing to Italy. 
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with fur lining of imitations and goggles with a wide silver obroučkami, one of the three buses. 
For five years with them, go to Oktoberfest, but this year organized three trips. 
During the night there during the day between the stands with beer in 22.30 Departure back. 
Overnight would be just unnecessary costs, says Marco. 
The path is 75 euros including a welcome toast beer Kaiser, uvařeným according to the law of the Bavarian beer purity, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco walked in Frankfurt on the language course. 
Buses out into the night, after the superhighway toward "Brennero. 
Beer does not, not yet. 
Bus rapid umlká, passengers sleep. 
Well they do, their forces still will need. 
It is in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where the number 8 on the highway from a piece of Munich makes one more break, and many other buses with Italian plates. 
When the group finally Marco according to plan in half the seventh morning comes to the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other coaches from all over Europe. 
Elena, Luca and others are collected, Marco is the last speech, explained the plan of attack. 
First: put a yellow cap. 
It is left written in Gothic "Oktoberfest", in addition to Internet address Marco travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it." 
Second: "When you open the door to the beer tent, run!" Marco calls to the morning air. 
"Go!" Go and occupy space in the back of the tent. 
"No advance, you do not impede, not all yellow Caps on the same bench, eventually, after the space!" 
Beer stein is 8 euros, 25 cents. 
And do not forget to tip. 
"Sekuriťákům show that fairly clearly. 
Once you leave your place, are gone! " 
Third:" Tonight, in exactly half the eleventh be back here! "Do you understand? 
And up to Wiesn, an area with beer tents. 
The way one member of the group navěšuje yellow Caps as a brand to trees, signs and even on election poster of a large Bavarian side. 
There is a need to prepare for the retreat. 
As a "weekend in Italy is known to the second weekend of Oktoberfest. 
Precise data on the number of visitors is not available; talking about fifty thousand of those are issued on a journey through the Alps and vpadají to the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend apparently arrived from Italy. 
Munich police will strengthen the series of seven policemen in southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, who leads national statistics in which the Italians against the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy first place. 
Especially popular is for Italians tent Hofbräu. 
Sleepless nights for the lender Hypo Real Estate 
Even last week, federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable. 
Well, that the policy used the word "relative" and in its claims vpletl the fact that the German banking sector remains a crisis of development spared. 
Because he is the last weekend. 
Dax index reference financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (game) gets a consortium of German banks' loan in the amount of several billion to protect against turbulence encounters in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit will support up to 35 billion euros. 
Interest will have to Hypo Real Estate (game) to pay only the amount actually spent. 
The money apparently comes from private and from public banks. 
In the background are the loss of a subsidiary Depfa. 
The state financier, according to newspaper reports on the long-term projects, which půjčoval money, extremely short-term refinanced, which is now due to lack of confidence in the markets it is not possible. 
In the first half of 2008, the Reserve Bank of wizened 95% to 2.37 million euros and slightly decreased the proportion of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
Ordinary income and net income from financial transactions compared to last year fell to zero, revenues from increased value of receivables and certain securities as well as the cancellation of provisions for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent of 5 million. 
But thanks to higher proceeds from the settlement of compensation for the subsequent costs of the restructuring of the former group Depfa and the interest tax in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and brokering group of companies was šestnáctiprocentní fall on the more moderate income. 
Former state financier, after its privatization in 1990, burned to mortgages for the professions, which have been allocated from the portfolio of services and also led Aareal Bank. 
Because in the conventional state funding is earn too little engaged with the Depfa heavily in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the State (Public-Private-Partnership, PPP) and is internationally diversified. 
The value of its subsidiary companies must now Hypo Real Estate and something to write off the depreciation will have "substantial, tangible effect on the calculation of profit and loss across the group, as some left vague to hear. 
The fact is that the dividend will not be. 
Already for 2007 was reduced by two thirds. 
Hypo Real Estate is taking over from Depfa major financier of state and infrastructure projects. 
More than other institutes depends on the refinancing on the interbank market, because no customer deposits. 
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago virtually dry spring interbank loans, as banks keep liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs for the year of the loan portfolio Depfa - about 50 billion - short-term funds for refinancing. 
According to the Commission Hypo Real Estate Group is a financial need this loan to dohlednou period covered and the company is protected "against the influence of the international money markets at the moment largely incapable of function." 
Other sources are allowed to hear that, thanks to such money is provided refinancing by the end of 2009. 
Chairman GAMEINFO Georg Funke on the other hand, said that a group of Hypo Real Estate Group in the foreseeable future will not have to use the money markets. 
Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the group Hypo Real Estate market is now assured. 
In the hope that shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But with regard to the dynamics and nepostižitelnost crisis is likely there is certainty. 
Even is not entirely ruled out that the loan could not be fully utilize. 
However, excluded or otherwise. 
After Bank late Sunday afternoon seems to have stood before the insolvency, can not, though preliminary, rescue calm passions. 
The course shares fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
On the other hand, a good hold rates bonds. 
While priority debts are practically applied, rates of secondary bonds lose more. 
This concerns mainly the bond of former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with maturities beyond 2009. 
Bonds Hypo-Real-Estate originally appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is necessary for a significant tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which the company brought it to the acquisition of Depfa, understood in relation to the stability of the international financial system. 
Until emission Bank, the government and less affected by commercial banks would be willing to support the system, it is possible to anticipate the payment of securities in their maturity. 
But it can also happen as it is currently almost no one not dare to hope - in the next 15 months will overcome the financial crisis. 
However, given the reports coming at the same time, with this partial zestátněním of the probability bordering on certainty now become only legitimate hope. 
Especially the long-term creditors are prepared by a number of probdělých nights when deciding whether to waive their obligations. 
Short-term investors can take advantage of the limit line, at least to the fact that it creates the transfer of losses from previous years for foreign exchange earnings later years for the purpose of future payment of taxes on capital gains. 
Sylvana and secrecy 
bento boxes. When you have TWO Sylvana Hiltropová first day at high school in Tačibaně present, the girls start to chuckle: the German is completely "kawaii!" 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana this already knows the word of manga. On his new blog on the exchange tells the story of Japan. 
"The first day in Japan. 
Sir, I was nervous. 
Already out of the way to school I had nahnáno. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and 40 minute train ride to the middle of Tačibaně. 
The way I had to find it, fortunately, I was lost. 
It seems that the beginning of training at Tačibaně not given so severely as at home in Lower Saxony. 
Students will meet for the eighth time an hour and twenty minutes before the ninth begins with a short stay with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'. 
But even before started teaching, I should imagine. 
I is not even the kind of man who likes talking in front of people, let alone the class of 40 students. 
Because I have no school uniform, I have to take apart the old coat of their host mothers, to bluzy, blue socks and black leather shoes. 
Thus makeup I have, therefore, stood before the bench and tried everything correctly say: 'Sayonara Wo that Sylvana ...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and a week my birthday. 
At that point I was very happy that I began to learn the language it two years ago. 
All 31 girls in the classroom šuškalo have, chichotalo and waved, and I always heard the word 'kawaii'. 
I already knew of its mangoes. 
Is one of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and a 'cute, sweet'. 
Then I quickly entered in his place. 
Girl next to me with a broad smile, deemed to honor that should sit next to her foreign student. 
The rest of June was relatively quiet, but when ozval gong, literally stopped me. 
Speak through a second and chichotaly and asked me to be the impossible - and it is really hard to understand Japanese English. 
The break then all vybalili their bent. 
My host mother also made me a box lunch - and this is something other than boring German snacks. 
I had rice with herbs, small párečky, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and tofu in a fish batter. 
Mostly no idea at all what exactly it here in Japan. 
These things look and taste quite odd new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Well, perhaps up to the salty preserved plums, br! 
Bent on Japanese schools not only lunch. 
Sometimes happens that a girl can be prepared with their kid bento, which in this case is particularly artistically prepared, and hopes that the guy in the break closer svačině know. 
I read about that in their manga comics. 
I wonder if you see here, too. 
'Why Japan? I asked my friend when I told them I wanted the year to go to school in Tokyo. 
I will always said 
'Because I just fascinated. " 
After all the years I prefer to read manga. 
And to those comics and culture to better understand, I began to learn a little Japanese. 
I was therefore quite clear that once I have come. 
Because I, too weakness for tradition, custom and traditions. 
And you are the high fields. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country the latest technologies and trends, on the other is a rigorous, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, yet I never feel lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city, which I have ever seen. " 
I have feelings of rats 
When a rat or a cockroach before escaping danger, it means that also feel scared? 
Neurologist Joseph Ledoux is convinced that many animals have feelings. 
But how could verify that feel the same when they behave like us? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" is already several years published the well-known scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE in the series introduces answer to the question "What is the truth, without needing to be able to prove it?" 
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, nor would I or anyone else so far could prove even though we can not prove that knowledge to other people. 
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration. 
But once we start to pay a different type of open questions of general perception, or consciousness, entering a field neschůdného because the hardware does not. 
When the rat gets into danger, do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack. 
People behave similarly, which some scientists to conclude similar subjective perception. 
In this, however, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of brain structures impede the transfer of our subjective experience of the perception of animals. 
Is it because circuits associated with the human mind, almost always include a side prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and execution and management). 
This vast area is for humans developed significantly more than in other primates, and it seems that for other creatures missing. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on prefrontálním cortex, among them learning who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that the man differs even from other primates. 
Another dramatic specificity could conceal the nature of human language: it is a large part of his perceptions associated with language, often says that consciousness depends on it. 
In this case, we could eliminate the animals. 
But even if the knowledge of the language matter, it would certainly influence the language, so the animal consciousness, whether it is designed, however, are likely to differ from most of our states of consciousness. 
Therefore, it is difficult to see how it looks knowledge about the other animals. 
When you like something internal and subjective, can not be measured or, because of the specific hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, puts us his examination of the major problems. 
Most of my sockets refers to the contents of conscious perception, but in addition, there is another aspect of consciousness, which should be scientifically made more easily accessible. 
It could be processes in the consciousness of animals examined, regardless of their content, and this is exactly going on in short-term memory studies in primates, particularly the example of visualization. 
But this approach, which is devoted Christof Koch and Francis Crick, will focus more on the neural correlates of consciousness, rather than causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they are not. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the cortex nefrontálního for the implementation of visualization. 
What are the consequences for feelings? 
I concludes that the emotional system as a system of fear, is activated in the brain expressly their own activities. 
What we call "fear", it is the mental state in which we are, when defense system activity localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reaction) makes use of RAM. 
Viewed from this angle, the feelings are closely linked with those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially people. 
The link with the linguistic nature creates fine graduation perception, because by using words and grammar can distinguish and categorize conditions, we are beside themselves attributed the second. 
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damásio believes that the feelings arising from primitivnějších activities in the areas of the cortex and the brainstem's physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, but more focus on the brainstem. 
Because the network during human evolution not changed, could still contribute to feelings perceived several animal families. 
Purely theoretically it can not interfere, but to consider unprovable. 
Pankseep argues that what we in rats and humans appear to be afraid, is likely to experience both organisms as well: How is it possible to verify but says further Pankseep that rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly? 
Cockroach against the dangers flee - he also felt scared? 
From my point of view not only the similarity of behavior to prove conformity of experience. 
It is true that a comparison of neural moves us away: rats and humans have similar brain strains, by contrast, cockroaches or brain. 
But it is responsible for feelings of brainstem? 
And even if it is possible to demonstrate in humans: how we wanted to demonstrate in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) Have feelings. 
I really do not know how I had to prove. 
And because their feelings are likely to differ substantially from those of our (the human consciousness is based on specific constituencies and language) examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats. 
Anyway, in this case, we can see progress on the neural level, as in rats and humans, we will measure the same thing. 
Just as in rats examine the language and consciousness, or examine the feelings, you do not know yet whether there. 
Is it possible to consider a short-sighted, but rather is moving forward than to repeatedly shedding against the wall. 
I am a practical emocionalista. 
UEFA president Platini: The period of grace for Poland and Ukraine 
Acting Prime Ivan Vasjunyk said that the training will soon be managed directly by the president and prime minister. 
"The government sees Bordeaux in the UEFA decision as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, together with Poland, ME," said Vasjunyk. 
"For our country but it is not amnesty. 
The work only began in both countries is still a lot to do." 
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts behind. 
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the ME reduced from eight to six. 
"We can no longer waste time. 
We must now work as quickly as possible, "said Chairman of the Ukrainian Federation Grigory Surkis. 
" UEFA we will be constantly monitored. " 
Even more radical move was agreed in Poland. 
The management of the Polish Union for PZPN have been numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee revoked and replaced by independent trustee Robert Zawlockim. 
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewieckého. 
He said there is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," said Drzewiecki Polish press agency PAP. 
"UEFA president Michel Platiniho letter, we ensure that this step suffers preparation for the ME 2012." 
Several teams from the first league was only in the past season due to manipulation sentenced to forced descent, eventually even had to be hastily moved the start of league.

On the other hand, there are irregularities in speed. 
Probe unexpectedly accelerate or slow down. 
So far, the fyzikům failed to explain this effect. 
Christened him gravitational anomalies sling. 
Several experts are concerned that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of mass curvature space may not be entirely correct. 
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains convinced that Einstein is wrong and seeks to explain the anomaly of gravitational sling using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in space, astronomers have found. 
"Such an anomaly that could be dark matter, which could be located very close to Earth," he writes. 
The existence of dark matter space researchers know only about ten years. 
It apparently is based on the gravitational force, the effect on other celestial bodies can be seen. 
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means it does not, or does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just not visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists is that dark matter a good fifth of the mass of the universe.

Obscure street, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale 
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only service. 
But many veterans cab driver-and long-term local difficulties is when they find Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of him. 
This little alley in the East Village neighborhood, and leads to the north of First Street - without having to catch up on the second street - between the bowery and other avenue. 
When a width of about ten and forty feet in length, rather than pass recalls dusty road move. 
There are no signs with street names. 
In the ordinary course of the atlas is virtually invisible. 
However, Lane is Admirers. 
For example, the company Avalon Bay, developer recently built luxury building on First Street. 
Extra Place wishes to the newly paved and create a cleaner passage of trade and butikům that the new buildings are open. 
Others are long-standing admirer neighbors, who say they were caught short charmed simply because it was one of the last remnants from the time before the block was compensating. 
But the city Office for the Protection and Development building, which has a street in his power, not the least interested in her hold. 
At the meeting of the Municipal Land Committee načrtli community representatives Magistrate and the company Avalon Bay plan, under which the developer should buy the street. 
However, according to Suzan Stetzerové, district manager of Community Municipal 3, the committee favors a variant of the street will remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan, which should be filed next month. 
"The town already owns a little land, and we would like to Extra Place in the property remains," she said. 
"They could be submitted proposals to repair and management, which could make Avalon, but also to guarantee public access." 
Avalon Bay a few months ago announced that it wants a small newly paved street and placed seats, which would use some cafe, whose interest in leasing space developer expects. 
The idea that the Avalon Bay to buy the street, was first published at a meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily possess. 
"The main thrust of Avalon Bay is correct and that uličku raffish make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the proposed sale of the city. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Office for the maintenance of buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office to develop the property rather than to manage. 
In comparison with its neighbor barvitějším, bowery, Extra Place left in the history of shallow brush. 
Some people think that street got its name in 1802, when she was a big farm Philip Minthorna divided between several of his children and that narrow strip of land, no one done right. 
Extra Place led to the back door CBGB, punkrockového monument, which closed in 2006, and Lane is perhaps best known as a background photograph on the cover albums the group Ramones' Rocket to Russia ". 
"This place was amazing," said Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who in November 1976 photo did. 
"It was full of garbage, roztrhaného clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and twine." 
Some local, including bloggers who write about finishing East Village neighborhood, is opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that that piece of public property, even if meager, should remain public. 
Others considered Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as is. 
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiášův Disappearing New York (with the subtitle "Book of wailing: bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction), vyvěsil part of the story on the Extra Place the sections Talk about the city, which appeared in newspapers in The New Yorker 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, and in the dark on a rezavými enclosed by iron gates, warehouses and zatlučenými windows, where the strouhách prohánějí week old newspapers." 
Until a few exceptions, look alley one recent evening in the same way. 
Krysa was conducted over the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, the place is now trade in expensive clothes. 
It was graffiti on the walls next to a fresh dose dropped newspapers lay an empty bottle of beer. 
A few passersby said that the Extra Place thinks rarely, but suggested that he could throw some encouragement. 
By contrast, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the effectiveness streets in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been in places dark, damp and odporných." 
The debate on bilingvalitě: immersion in English 
In this edition Feature Focus on education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates for the position bilingvnímu education. 
Lance T. Izumi, academic staff from kalifornistiky and director of education in the organization of Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-book "Worse than you think: why middle class needs to choose schools." 
Effectively reach out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter. 
Learning agenda Barack Obama just proves. 
Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and hispánští students have significantly lower likelihood that dostudují than white students," which is true. 
That with such performance differences fight, promotes Obama's education agenda in particular, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are still learning English. 
Barack Obama on the issue, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingvnímu education, which emphasizes to the classroom to use other languages than English, is stronger than his interest in reducing the performance gap. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, charter elementary school in the district of East Los Angeles. 
Pupils of the schools are in most cases Hispánci from low-income families. 
More than a third of students, many of which came only recently, are still learning English. 
Despite the state tests in mathematics in 2008 reached the highest level of pupil incredible hundred percent fourth grades. 
Almost as wonderful ninety-three percent of fourth grades students received at the highest level in state tests of English Language and Literature. 
This incredible success has been achieved by any other method than they prefer Obama. 
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, continuous assessment of capabilities and access without excuses. 
In addition, and that Obama would be noted by Linda Mikelsové, Director of Sixth Street, a pedagogical approach schools for those who are still learning English, "full immersion". 
Immersion in English emphasizes almost privileged use of English in teaching. 
Miss Mikelsová, which is against bilingvnímu education, told me: "We had great success with a completely new pupil in Mexico - after twelve months, you went to class and not who he is." 
"It works," said, "For us it works." 
Obama would take the school as a Sixth Street Prep as a model, as should the other schools with large proportions hispánských are learning English and students? 
The results, which the school is making, should the answer to that question make granted, but the educational agenda of his own party (National Education Association is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his consistent support for bilingual education znejasňují predicting Obama's response. 
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, trivialized the case recently when he declared that people should not worry about the "English only" laws. 
Instead, "you should ensure that your children speak Spanish," he said. 
If you Obama actually wants to delete the performance differences should be rather educational models that work, to think carefully before they mock and trivialize it.

After reaching a maximum 145.29 dollars per barrel in July fell earlier this month prices nearly to 90 dollars per barrel, then jumped back on the huge wave of uncertainty in financial markets. 
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Bureau of Congress reported that the weekend reached agreement on the largest rescue plan in history. 
This message was overshadowed by fresh concern that the financial crisis has far to the end. 
In the latest episode of progressive degradation government announced that the banking group Citigroup's purchase of Wachovia Corporation section. 
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Government zestátnily part of the financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Barclays Capital analysts, the company said that the savage weekend negotiations which led to a plan to rescue the economy, "the show itself to be incompetent to revive the mood of the market."

"The prospects for global equities markets, interest rates and exchange rates heavily znejistěly," wrote analysts from Deutsche Bank in a report to investors.

From the perspective of a commodity is our biggest concern, the extent to which the American virus spread to the whole world and especially to China." 
Analysts that the bank reduced its expectations for the coming year, as oil consumption has decreased because of the slower economic growth, and lowered its forecast gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20%. 
Wild ride in the second quarter exceeded the record 
team. After spending the shirt Jets over the last eight seasons more than anybody else, the defensive player of Shaun Ellis thought I saw everything. 
Then on Sunday followed the development of second quarter in which the Jets turned the game scoreless in the graceful ride. 
"I have never seen anything like this," said Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and Cardinals arizonští his troubled game up pošmourným mrakům over them. 
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on dvanáctiyardový touchdownový sprint, which perfectly marked an afternoon in which they gradually developing co-operation moved about a mile ahead. 
Favre sent Coles in the quarter for the other two touchdown, including one in which the cornerback fell, and a further 10 seconds before half time. 
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre of all its přihrávkách Coles. 
"It's damn good player. 
Communicate with us well, whether people believe anything." 
While Coles and Favre throw, defense contested the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Cornerback Darelle Revise captured stray hour and returned it 32 yards for the touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith has identified a further pass and caught it. 
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumblu. 
Last loss of balls, fumble, which forced Bowens, was perhaps not the best. 
Cardinals team got the ball 10 seconds before and after the Jets get the ball back, Feel kopl Jay dvacetiyardový goal from the field, which acquired management 34-0. 
This is the best, what the Jets acquired in one quarter. 
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the frenzy, said: "The second quarter or third quarter?" 
When he was told that both of them - Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without reply - Mangini said, "I can tell you that second quarter I take much more than the third. 
Fell a lot of points in a short space of time." 
An Gebreselassie improved his world record 
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best for the district runners at all when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon, broke his own world record and became the first man to stray 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes. 
Comfortable victory in the flat track at the time of 2:03:59 převálcoval 27 seconds his previous time of 2:04:26, which stray last year in Berlin. 
Gebreselassie, who is 35, created the 26th world record his career, which is actually an incredibly wide - surpassed the world record, or at least master the world at all distances from the metric mile for a marathon. 
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing because it was afraid - of hindsight perhaps too startled - that polluted air rozdráždí his problems with asthma. 
Instead, he promised that will run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in goal - won Sunday Gebreselassie with bleskurychlým average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds in the mile. 
As track runners as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on the longer runs, fell marathon record in the past decade by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in a time of 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998. 
After Sunday's victory Gebreselassie told journalists that it was two weeks ago cramps in the calf and missed a week of training. 
Break it obviously nabudila rather than delayed. 
"I am so happy," said Gebreselassie reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
Before the week I started again and today I was a bit doubtful, but everything was okay." 
Has also been criticized - especially in Kenya, East rivalovi Ethiopia - because of its allegedly overly planned plants, generally shunned the world maratónským peaks, rely on wires, as if it was a race track, and building world records over the sense of competition. 
But this criticism may be difficult to reduce the huge cross-country Gebreselassieho quality. 
Kept pace in four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half-time in 1:02:04. 
After the wires revolted, proháněli constantly Gebreselassieho two elite runners keňští James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi. 
A little earlier than three miles from Gebreselassie last took aim and fled Kwambaiovi, which then India on the second place at the time of 2:05:36 and thus improve their personal maximum of almost five minutes. 
Kamath finished third in time of 2:07:48. 
In the women's race završila excellent year, the seventh fastest time of 2:19:19 history Irina Mikitěnková, rodačka from Kazakhstan, which is now občankou Germany. 
Record time of 2:15:25 held by Paula Radcliffová from Great Britain. 
Šestatřicetiletá Mikitěnková surprisingly won last spring in the London marathon in a time of 2:24:14. 
Beijing missed the game due to what was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which when run, to improve their personal maximum of almost five minutes. 
Running the race smart and well: let go four Ethiopian and keňských runner in the big edge and then after about 18 ½ miles dotáhla. 
Askale TAFA Magarsaová from Ethiopia India second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kipropová of Kenya finished third in time of 2:25:01. 
Pride and obstacles of life of blacks in a separate city 
Hidden among rozlezlými more leisure parks of Orlando, a few miles from all lesklého, noisy and obrovitého, is a quiet town, which comes alive with pride and intensity of African life. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurstonová spent his childhood, is no longer so simple, as described in 1935, "a city of five lakes, three kroketových pitches, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough guavas, two schools and no jail. " 
Now is the place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual festival eatonvillský Zora! That passed worshiped Hurstonové, the most famous women's writer Harlem Renaissance. 
City, which described, the party, although it did stop for tourists that it included in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project at the time of economic crisis. 
It is still so independent, dignified and private, as it was in the thirties years when Hurstonová wrote that venkovští blacks in Florida are often resisted and did not act on their real feelings with a white man who "knows about us so little that neither knows what is coming . 
Even today, in the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for open debate on Race, many local residents remain cautious towards altogether alien. 
"We provide great care to how to tell our story," says 59letá Hortense Jones, who lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city. 
"It must be right." 
Eatonville was long described as the paradox of triumph and effort. 
It is both a historical model of a black rise, so the community almost 2400 people, where poverty rates are twice the average celonárodnímu. 
Is the center of literature, but also oaks shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed - has been launched from American slavery. 
It is not too surprising that local people are both proud and ochranářští. 
A charge of Eatonvillu idea really started when Zoro, which is the only way we are here Hurstonové says. 
Introduced the world their hometown through a book full of warm dialect as "Mules and Men (mules and men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (Their eyes follow God)" (1937). 
Five paragraphs Florida tourist guide to the city has changed little in 17 road that leads through the center of Florida is often brushed aside, the stage black history and human drama. 
With razancí large drum in the life and literature Hurstonová introduced readers to trade first eatonvillského Mayor Joe Clark, and then turned into personalized sites. 
"Left by the roadside," she wrote, "is brown-white decorated with modern school with well-maintained yards and the golf course, which is always the old Howard Miller, although a lot can not read or write." 
It also mentioned a new husband and widows Dashové wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and at all anything that fits into the hourly hotel." 
So in just a few hundreds words linking Hurstonová Eatonville, the Palestinian Authority, but also illiteracy, znovuuzavíraním marriage and sex. 
This is obviously not a typical publisher Fodor's. 
In fact, it was a portrait that would all appreciate. 
"Zora said, as it was," says devadesátiletá Ella Dinkinsová, one of the Johnson girls choir, which Hurstonová made immortal by quoting a man who sang about the beauty of their stupid songs. 
"A few people did not like it," he added. 
Hurstonovou to be here still remembers as a nimble výstřednici, which often back after what her family moved to Jacksonville Florida. 
Sedmasedmdesátiletý Augustus Franklin will remembers that the majority when the city přiřítila, arrived unannounced in the huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore trousers in the city, which is still proud of the decent clothing. 
Most people have been fascinated, said Franklin but the pošklebovali many. 
"People Zoru always like to see," said Franklin. 
But, he added, houpaje the chair on the back terrace with a view of the lake Sabelia where Hurstonová most likely be christened, "never go too long." 
When Hurstonová 1960 died were poor and the books have been withdrawn from the press. 
It seemed that it Eatonville, together with the rest of the world forgot. 
Although once a literary star, contemporaries Langston Hughes and the only black at Barnard College in the twenties of the 20th century, was buried in unmarked grave in Fort Pierce Florida, where he lived. 
In Eatonvillu no more mourning ceremonies or large public reading. 
"I think that even its importance for the world, or even understand the reference," said Valerie Boydová, author biography Hurstonové "Wrapped in Rainbows (packed in duhách)" issued in 2003. 
Change came in the 80th 20 years of the century. 
Orange County district officials wanted to stretch the city pětiproudou highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a two-local main road. 
Rozlézání Orlando has protlačilo interstate highway No. 4 through western edge of town. 
Proposal came at a time when Eatonville ever received from a complex historical period. 
Forced integration, along with other things, put an end to a relatively idyllic isolation of this community. 
In the fifties 20th century brought the fight for stirring up race hatred on the threshold of the community. 
"At that time, a group of white boys, they come and throw oranges and things to the people who sat on the side," said Franklin. 
"Actually, we had one lady, which it killed. 
Threw from the car melon." 
In a letter to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, challenged the requirement Hurstonová Supreme Court on the forced integration and its decision in the case of Brown against the chamber of Education said that "for insulting my race, rather than celebrating." 
Residents now contends that the desegregation of schools, although in some areas was positive, reducing the Eatonvillu cohesion and undermined the courage of local youth. 
"Black children were accustomed to embrace - remember this - you have embraced my window early in the morning, you have embraced my window tonight," said Nathiriová NY, the daughter Elly Dinkinsové and executive director of a non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save Eatonvillskou community). 
That lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, added. 
"Neobjímáte a white teacher because your teacher white - I mean that there is a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiriová. 
Civil rights, however, helped to create a space for many other Żory Neale Hurstonové - černošští writers, actors and artists who, as she advanced to the prejudices lehkomyslným confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence! 
I never." 
In 1975 doputovala Alice Walker to neoznačenému grave Hurstonové and began to fight for the revival of its reputation. 
Five years later came to the shelf in bookstores Hurstonové acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenwaye, which re-entered in the U.S. kánonu. 
The project with the highway arrived at a time when most famous daughter Eatonvillu again find the light ramp. 
Former neighbors Hurstonové it is now considered spasitelku. 
To show what may become a highway to destroy the community began in 1988 to plan the festival Hurstonové. 
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many returned to the celebration. 
State after several years of the highway gave way to the draft. 
"The five streams raised highway, you said that directly odpálilo, real civic pride," said Nathiriová. 
Boydová said simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
Victory over the highway project has helped change the image of the city. 
Mimoměstští as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has to go to the local church in 1993, began appearing in greater numbers, and people began to reassess the past. 
Eatonville join the national historical registry in 1998. 
The new one-Library (named after Hurstonové of course) was opened in 2006 and again vyasfaltovaném adorned Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, the Eatonville Florida anomalies: just six miles from downtown Orlando may sometimes act as a remote street in the summer rain, so small, such as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the eighties 19th century. 
(Today it is 90 percent black.) 
With strangers who come looking for a story and the importance of Eatonvillu, is still often treated with caution. 
Authorization for the majority of interviews it is necessary to have in advance and some things - such as murals in eatonvillském oldest church, painted white and displaying černochy the field - may not photograph. 
Many in Eatonvillu, such as Jones, brave, confident teacher who is like deep red, still fear that their community is not insulated properly understood. 
And even as the festival Hurstonové increased, increased domestic pride. 
Particularly young people tend to see Eatonville, as Hurstonová saw all his race: a beautiful, with the problems and so, but not better, not worse, as proudly, creative, industrious, foolish and varied as any other American racial and ethnic group. 
The voice Franklinova nephew, osmnáctiletého Edwin Harveyho, There is genuine love for the village when plans to return to Eatonvillu after high school to work in local government or the police, which says it would take some help. 
And even younger, such as eleven twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonovy, it seems, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people, when they have just passed, the pomyslí: 'Well, this town is nothing against the other,'" said Alondra Kenonová recent Sunday after church. 
"But if you really stop and look at the moment in history, it is a very nice city." 
Here in New York talking all fluent finančsky 
At first glance, nothing has changed there. 
If the tourists to keep away from the Manhattan newspaper stands and obrovitých television screens in Times Square, would not realized that it is in the midst of the storm. 
I never would guess that proskleném vcelim úlu agencies over their heads every day to bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day at the office" from the crisis of 1929. 
Messengers still rattle metal trucks for transport and transferred Casseroles muffin at breakfast meeting. 
Hispánci is still moving between high-rises and wear, such as human mules, Fifty vyžehlených shirts that hang from vahadel on their backs. 
Office rats are still waiting in the queue on your morning bagel for street dining booths, and still is not possible to get the weekday yellow cab between the fourth and seventh afternoon. 
Look at all as a crisis until I have all the words of pessimism, did not set up on Thursday afternoon savings account. 
Even though I načasoval this task so that it coincided with the late-afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, already there in the queue waiting about twenty people. 
Not before the cashier windows to retrieve or save money, but the bulkhead, where the older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask to travel to the grocery Macy's and new customers set up accounts. 
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came the same way as I do. 
But compared to me, I chose the economies of smaller banks in places arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island. 
Select money from the so-called Thrift (a bit like building spořitelnám), cash associations and savings banks, those types of branches operating in only one country, which maintains that its customer care as a family. 
In the past year 15 such banks quietly bankrupt. 
A few days ago passed Washington Mutual, Bank of assets for 327 million dollars in bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers return home for the weekend on Friday, tried another bank, Wachovia, with assets at 440 billion U.S. dollars, to catch rescue buyers. 
Staff offices and shops, who stood before me and they were afraid of further collapse, shift their money into a bank, which is seen as a safe haven, which makes most of saving on Wall Street. 
Ordinary New Yorkers after last week learned fluent finančsky. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket talking into the phone and voice to the Lehman Borthers, another failed bank, and its vyhublému Chief Executive Dick Fulda worker with such familiarity, as if Drbal the lazy colleague. 
And Lyn, uniformed domovnice about fifty years of my apartment building, changed the topic of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my delivery of food. 
After my visit at the bank told me: "Now I have my savings in money market funds. 
I moved to, I will not risk it." 
Muslim graves desecration by the Austrian right-wing break 
Heinz-Christian Fear, left, the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian party Vlaams Belang participating in rallies, which presented in Antwerp on Thursday, 17th January 2008 the organization "Cities against Islamization". 
Like traffic signs bearing the marks that show mosques přeškrtnuté red line. 
Police accuse right-wing extremists desecration of the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties have reached huge gains in general elections. 
More than 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz was sometimes between Friday evening and this ránem heavily damaged and police are convinced that this was an organized action. 
Offenders nasprejovali some of the tombs of Jewish symbols such as David's star, but detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to smooth out the motives of extremists led by hatred for the Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether this incident in any way linked to the elections. 
Spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration, which comes at a time when approaching the end of the Muslim Ramadan month of Lent. 
Austria, meanwhile, enters the round of his own soul searching after zhouplo right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two extreme-right parties which together won more than 30 percent of the votes, party and the Freedom Union for the Future of Austria, led vehemently protiimigrační campaign, and some of their slogans have been critics condemned as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Fear, chairman of Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of votes in the campaign protested against šátkům and Burkau, and even expressed his opposition to the meal, which is perceived relationship to Islam. 
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna spoke of "a European brotherhood, which is designed to prevent the rise of Islam. 
Both sides seek to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.

Paul Newman Americas without the themselves do not like it so much 
"Sometimes God created the perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of them." 
These are the words of actress Sally Fieldové who worked with him on "Without evil intentions" and under the weight of note that Newman left, reveals a dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America. 
Look how they ran, than get an Oscar. 
And that has been retired since 2007. 
And it known that it is desperately ill. 
Despite all the macho. 
"Sometimes what people feel, you can not express in any way, and I lost a great friend now," said Robert Redford, in tears, "my life and my country has been through it better." 
No fear that it will be ridiculous or over the top. 
Father died in a home movie, and especially gloomy time of fear of terrorists and financial markets at a time when America's self-confidence is at the bottom, where desperately searching for reasons for pride. 
When the time is tough, and people without virtue, and only a handful of those who they are worth admiration - no need to be Luis Cernuda, that we love Paul Newman. 
For all embodied almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official opponent Richard Nixon and champion of lost and won cases from the Foundation against drug addiction based on the honor of the first-born son, who died of the overdose, after his own brand of domestic food and organic food. 
A complete treasure for the country, which was a lot of effort away from the suicide dietary culture. 
Stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of ethnicity or nationality. 
Last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that one man died, but an entire era. 
Another Englishman, Oscar winner for directing Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration peak of his career. 
Bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, a troufl Newman described as its biggest source of inspiration. 
"The dog put us all pretty high bar," notes George Clooney, maybe one of the few who has the courage today to try to live life as Paul Newman - is based on honesty and a serious lead a private life away from the cameras. 
This is not in today's media jungle always easy, sometimes not even possible. 
But, fortunately, such people are and Paul Newman as their model. 
Once developed, and since then has been married fifty years with Joanne Woodwardovou that was true, although certainly had more than ample opportunity not to be. 
"Why would I go out for hamburger when I got home filet?" like vtipkoval. 
Whether it is in heaven accompanied by the pride that the country is ruled on the interplay between his daughters and groupie - in America too is not normal. 
It is said that "from all the major roles that ztělesnil was nejpyšnější the role oddaného husband, father, friend, grandfather and willing obětavého philanthropist." 
Imperfect Madrid 
Olympic races. Yes, many of us crave the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the missed 2012 to may 2016. 
But I ask: we are ready? 
If we manage yesterday's race, so I say no! 
Talking about it as a perfect race, and in my opinion, was the worst to which I have ever been. 
Such a congeries nonsense that just had occurred on the evaluation, and I was the investigator, would be insufficient to clear. 
But look at it from the beginning, pretty one at a time. 
Nonsense to begin collecting závodnického numbers, for which a man must go first. 
That to me seems wrong, but if there is one, whether it can be anything (including chip is used to prevent overfilling of the runway). 
Oh, no. 
Here one must first collect the number (the first nonsense, go there only because) and (after vystání appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - Had only a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need a size XL). 
Where to live? 
This is due to the crisis decided to buy only a small T-shirts, since it is less substance and are cheaper? 
Well, these are but trifles compared with what happened on the day of the race. 
In addition, it had to go very early to queue at the chip and it lasted over 15 minutes, had to be there to cast the pack. 
Lasted over 35 minutes waiting period, which is at the plant, where it is expected 11 000 people, something nepochopitelného. 
So, as expected, the race started and we still neodložili backpacks, and when they succeeded, with a collection that was much worse. 
In addition, prolonged waiting 40 minutes rain, leading to widespread mutiny and the attack on the cab. 
I believe that 500 of us will be tomorrow, bronchitis and some, like me, does not display the right time in the evaluation of the results for the chip, which gave me and which, as I suppose, I jumped right time to start. 
Of course, if someone asked me to a perfect race, this was not by me. 
And I believe that we have a well-prepared Olympic city have only dream of. 
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual) 
At the conference on new technologies MIT made Microsoft the further development of a new system of image and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too smart, but able to perform basic tasks such as hail a cab (or in the case of Microsoft, messengers, which ranged across the campus company) and seen what hear in an interview. 
Thanks to a camera system that recognizes shapes and face, this "reception" to determine how many people in the room who they are - even remember what they have to each other - and listen and understand the keywords of their talks. 
It can also classify under the present chat groups. 
At the demonstration video reception record third person and understand that it does not belong to the group which speaks to her, and that this is not an employee of society. 
Asks her if someone is in, and informs her that she will pay for the moment. 
All this without the blue screen of death. 
Fascinating. 
But this is obviously the future of music. 
Now the firm has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system. 
This week a lot about the change in strategy for Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs. 
Steve Ballmer came to the fact that if the computer had only to the minimum, unballasted commercial zbytečností, would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, you will be cheaper. 
Discover the thunder, given that the Microsoft version of the Windows version adds new features and other "extra". 
Changing course would be a worthy act. 
Microsoft has the right operating system is slowly losing its importance, and so is the software. 
When the network appeared Chrome Google, I became one of those who are moving towards the theory that it was the first step for Google competition with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not operating system. 
The operating system will always be needed, because it is a necessary layer of understanding between hardware and software. 
Is the same as your wife or your husband when you have something to tell her mother in law. 
That is true. 
Never disappear, but it is necessary to think of a "death" operating system not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth. 
What Ballmer said this week, confirms this idea. 
People spend less and less attention to the operating system and on the other hand, more Internet Browser. 
The computer is turned on, in order to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day spend more time on the Internet than around the windows. 
About half the applications that accompany the system? 
Less is more. 
A Windows 7 must be less, far less than Vista. 
Less severe, less loaded, less complex. 
Microsoft now has an interest in offering their services on-line and finally become an alternative to Google. 
Desperately need it, and here I have a small example. 
I did this photograph in one rest room for the employees of Microsoft in Redmond, at the beginning of the month. 
On the beverage automaton was a poster, which is ask to use their search engines: "Your search. Our Future." 
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees to use the Google search on the Internet. 
Last week, the way has confirmed the delay a new version of Windows Mobile 7th 
Comes at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, therefore, prefer to count up to 2010. 
In Microsoft will definitely try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together. 
The phone is becoming more and more computer. 
Whereas Android and the iPhone already on the market, will have to pay dear for a delay. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso he wore to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in the one shining in the "bloody diamond" Edward Zwick, like Al Pacino in "Godfather" Francis Ford Coppola, and in addition is part of uniforms muscular gay community. 
And if we run into the list of his life roles, can dive to the typical image of the trichinae špičatým mustache, which lifts dumbbells in kočovném circus. 
In essence, it is not anything more than the typical cotton men's lower vest, tight and sleeveless. 
Speakers to say 'tank', but the Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others. 
First, for its name-neck - even if they are popularly called 'Marcel' - which is linked to sport, because, as legend tells, was named after the boxer Marcela CERDAN, lovers singer Edith Piaf. 
'Marcel' excels over other high-quality cotton, unisex shearing, a distinctive tag (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag to be models nejemblematičtějších sweat T-shirts as a detail in the neck. 
A careful, because the Belgian company nespecializuje only to tank tops. 
Also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy T-shirts, oblečky for children, mini shorts ... 
Thoughtful pieces for a comfortable underwear. 
Although it is a pity that only underwear. 
They are too beautiful. 
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be the father, does not worry me." 
Enormous similarities to her sister has not prevented the development of their own personalities. 
Mónica Cruzová, though minor characters is a woman full of life. 
His new work in fashion takes nurse now Cruzovy very seriously. 
For Mónica it means much more than that of a beautiful, famous girls lend his name. 
In Paris, participated in promotions that the company Mango organized in their new location, and the publication nevýznamnějších fashion prices, which the Spanish company sponsors.

It was therefore challenging but also exciting day. 
What is your new collection for the company Mango, for which work is already the fourth season? 
Me and my sister love films from 50th and 60 years and the many initiatives we have received. 
It is also much like vagrants of the city and see women as clothing goes, as they combine and layer your clothes, to do very often. 
Are you a dancer, actress, designer, a very versatile woman, is it? 
I think so, but ultimately everything is connected and has a lot of continuity. 
I need like clothes from childhood, I always wanted to go to the grandmother, go through the cupboards of their aunts and view its clothes. 
That was a sensation, almost better than to go on pilgrimage. 
When I then became a dancer, I always tried to keep it as I go dressed. 
You know that we have dancers based on how we adjust, to its lessons and tests when looking in the mirror feel good. 
And as an actress, when you can dress, was actually pronikneš to the figures. 
So everything is interconnected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism. 
Recently, I was 30, upon thee crisis? 
Nope. 
I feel better than ever before, I like thirty. 
I find that a woman is already finished, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer errors. 
I do not fear the biological clock. 
Childhood doing what I want, and this gives me great inner happiness. 
So think of mother to be, or not? 
Of course I know that I will be your mother, because my body so requests, and in addition, I want to be a young mum, I do not want to miss. 
As far as the father, this I don 't worry. 
But one I will, give your child experience the feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love. 
As regards the film, waiting for you now prime minister a few movies that you recorded last year. 
It's that and I look forward to coming to the cinema. 
I come from the theater world, and I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now and so of course not.

Purpose, as will be like ... 
A few days ago you were made its debut on přehlídkovém pier alongside Naomi Campbell, is it? 
Well, to say. 
Not so that I can go get on the pier as a model. 
Only call me Naomi Campbell, which has long been known, and invited me to London to take part in benefit shows for the organization "Women for a better life, and clothes that we presented - I chose the two models from our collection for Mango -- , The vydražilo and the proceeds were forwarded to the Naomině non-governmental organization. 
People know that Naomi is so good heart. 
Invitations for a lot of things and I, because I know it, you can say that many of them are not true. 
In addition, I will keep this good, what is involved. 
Asked me to performed for charitable purposes, but if you ask me to do rails, do it, too. 
For women in the Third World to do what is needed. 
Drivers repeatedly přistižení alcohol in the blood will need to install "alcolocks" 
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol in his car had to install a system that will prevent him start in the car drunk or if you nedýchne. 
Proposal came to be known as early as June this year and now is already included in the annual reports the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, under which a pilot project that will last one year. 
Its aim is to return the driver for the steering wheel, because the drivers will have to undergo re-education course of transport. 
On this experience, in addition to the National Agency for Traffic Safety will participate in the Directorate General of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation Institute for Security Technology Information (FITSA). 
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% automobilistů accused more than once for the management of the drunk again in this state sits at the wheel. 
Alcolocks would be avoided because it is a system attached to the vehicle, which measures the level of alcohol in a puff of air and prevents the car to start if the driver before nedýchne or if it is reported higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol. 
Its price exceeds 1 000 euros and had to pay it himself culprit. 
A study carried out in this respect in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device, during the first year since the introduction of offenses decreased by 65%. 
In Spain, assumes that each year could save the lives of 115 people. 
Measures shall be limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to deal with this behavior before it concludes with the offense. 
And to facilitate its implementation since the legislation is to make the usual way, needed change of penal provisions, however, requires amendment of the law. 
Yet it is not yet on the Spanish market available in any retail version, although in some industrial vehicles and vehicles of public service has been installed service. 
On the day of Members of Congress will vote on a proposal PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), which is recommended to install the system in school buses, as is the case in France.

Top fashion subsidized price 
Probably not the world a better place for the publication of fashion rather than Paris, and probably not znamenitějšího designer and bonvivána than Valentino. 
The company Mango just launched the second year El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enable the international presentation of new talent in the field of fashion. 
The cost is subsidized by 300 000.

Office is called stress and the computer back pain. 
Stress is a disease in the 21st century.

Speaking of sleep 
Some children in the night, he said. 
I do not think those wakes up and nimbly to tell us something about what happened the day before, but children who speak while sleeping. 
When that happens the first time, maybe you make, but in fact it is insignificant. 
This is a harmless sleep disorder, which is called somnilokvie. 
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents. 
Sure than one told you that night spoke of sleep. 
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime at high horečkách), or with greater frequency (every day, every week, once every few months ...), the second day the child anything you do not. 
There is only one reason to explain its onset. 
Often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night běsi, enuresis nocturna (nocturnal enuresis), or sleepwalking, but may not be so. 
As previously mentioned, can often accompanied by high fever, stress or rozjitřené situation. 
In any case, it is a little probádaný phenomenon. 
The intensity with which it occurs, it is also different. 
The child can speak calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or the contrary (screams, tears, long speeches ...). 
In cases where a show with great power, it would be appropriate to the child to observe and consult with a professional to see if it does not have a problem, which causes him great anxiety, and in this way is reflected. 
We said that this is a harmless disorder, thus not treated, only if associated to the further failure of sleep, which can be treated (for example, if associated with Apne syndrome or permanent stress). 
We can not take it that we have in mind some very simple preventive measures, such as: 
Try to kid too nerozrušovat before it is to sleep. 
So look for a quiet game and avoid strašidelným or somewhat violent television programs or seriálům. 
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to enable them to obtain a Peace. 
This will allow the child calmer sleep. 
When the somnilokvie, try to keep calm. 
Remember that the child is harmless and that from what happened, the second day will no longer remember anything. 
Useful advice 
Do not be him. 
This is unnecessary because it is not conscious and thus interrupt his sleep. 
While talking, sleeping and, therefore, rests. 
Remember that seems If you do several times in a row that is very troubling, it would be advisable to go for advice or to find out what the child raises the anxiety. 
If it is to understand what he says (which is not so normal), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information from it. 
It will not be useless, because when you sleep, not in the knowledge that could collect my thoughts. 
In addition, you may hear what he says, but you do not know what it seems, and therefore what to say, so you give great attention to information and interprets the findings docházíte. 
Never say the child to him at night, you can question on his secret. 
Neither of fun. 
This raises a big anxiety. 
Do not just worry, this is not a bad thing, it's only episode that takes only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern ... Finally, 
Illhaeusern Finally, after a long lean period re find the path to victory. 
Without having played a particularly great game, yellow have created more chances and managed one of them victoriously to turn. 
The game had during the confrontation, in which the attackers is difficult to enforce, too rapid a pace. 
After the first attempt captain Kauffmanna hosted by missile from a distance only narrowly missed connecting, began to have Illhaeusern slightly up and first Fonderflick from afar, then Hirne air, Romain long leg or Diebold gradually came irritate Defense DANNEMARIE. 
Opponent, by contrast, built a playground in the middle of the defensive wall and left only the tip of attack agile Riahiho. 
Beginning the second half proved crucial, firstly because the two opportunities DANNEMARIE with the names of Riahi and Temporal, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which had Marais, a well-situated for the treatment of balls reflected Dieboldově after the previous attempt (53 '). 
Golman Illhaeusernu However, the joy long nevychutnával, after about twelve minutes, was forced to return to the changing rooms and to leave their teammates in weakening.

"It would be a mistake to underestimate. 
It is talent," pointed out, however, the weekend Bill Clinton. 
Sedmdesátník McCain would consistently emphasized his experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time stressed the "naivete" of his opponents on issues that constitute the core of the first encounter.

Sanctions, which include a ban on visas for 40 Belarusian pohlavárů and freeze some assets might be canceled if the election observers will be considered clean. 
According to the opposition this was not the case. 
"We were kept away from electoral commissions, and our observers not to attend the counting of votes," complained to Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union's democratic forces, diverse groups of twelve pages. 
"It is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and the leader pro-European movement, "because it is essential that sums up the votes, to us it is the executive. 
If some opposition members get into Parliament will be that it will be appointed and not elected. 
Their entry into the Parliament, however, may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills. " 
The opposition is therefore feel obliged to participate in the political functioning, because" it is necessary to initiate a dialogue with the European Union. 
If our economy is, deep debt in Russia, affecting the crisis and we nezreformujeme threatens us, that will act as a protectorate of Russia. 
However, we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, did not elections as valid.

Interview - blood, which in turn is a sure 
HEMA-Québec yesterday celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment and its president, dr. Francine Décaryová is rightly rejoiced because HEMA-Québec has become one of the most reliable and efficient suppliers of blood in the world. 
Especially you again gained the confidence of the public, which has been contaminated blood scandal in the 80 and 90 Between seriously shaken. 
As is well known, the State Department maintained a reserve of blood transfusions the Canadian Red Cross during the 80th years contaminated immune deficiency virus (HIV) virus and hepatitis C. 
In view of this drama and a wave of public displeasure Canadian government launched in February 1994 a public investigation, by Judge Horace Krever, and in order to explain the circumstances that led to this tragedy, and to formulate recommendations for such a disaster will not recur. 
While Judge Krever otálel to when the report, some of the province into operation Committee, whose purpose was to plan a new system of administration of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec this role behalf Gélineaův Committee. 
After Gélineauově and Kreverově report were in Canada, the establishment of two suppliers: HEMA-Québec, who had managed Québec, a Canadian company for the supply of blood all provinces and two territories. 
"When in 1998 HEMA-Québec launched its activities, barely 38% of people should have confidence in Quebec blood system," remembers dr. Décaryová. 
"The situation was depressing. 
Systematic efforts to enhance the safety of blood products and continuing work in this area during subsequent years, we once again gained the confidence of the public," he says proudly and adds that at the beginning of 2008 HEMA-Quebec confidence has nearly 94% of Quebec population. 
Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of that confidence is something very fragile. " 
Since its inception 28th September 1998 HEMA-Québec apply the precautionary principle. 
"Then we were in Europe witnessed the occurrence of many cases of human form of mad cow disease, new variant of the disease, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," tells the woman that led the company since its foundation in 1998. 
"And we knew that the disease may spread by blood. 
We are therefore based on one of the basic recommendations Kreverovy and Gélineauovy reports according to which, where and when to know is at stake spread of serious diseases, in this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, the Negative measures to be taken. 
In April 1999, we have therefore rejected the blood of people who abstain from 1980 in the UK for longer than one month. 
A few years ago was safely demonstrated that the disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode has shown us, therefore, that adhere to the principle of caution made sense. " 
In 1999, the market appeared more accurate technique to detect the HIV virus: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT), which make it possible to detect in the blood donor directly to the presence of the virus and not the presence of antibodies, which were based on tests used previously. 
NAT assays allow the deaf to shorten the period that occurs between the moment the patient's infection and the time when our techniques can be detected in the blood of the first viruses, explains specialized. 
This year we could be shortened to less than a week. 
We thus substantially reduce the risk that some donors may be infected without knowledge and without to be able to come. 
These improvements allow the acquisition to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusions. 
The risk that HIV-contaminated blood given, is now exposed to a man of 12 million. 
"In other words, it means that than someone infected with HIV, will be distributed 12 million blood products. 
Whereas HEMA-Québec distributes annually 400 000 to 500 000 blood products, will be 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through blood products. 
I believe that we can get the rest in full or prescribe a transfusion of blood necessary for healing, "says šéfka leadership HEMA-Quebec. 
" The challenge for the next decade we maintain the security of our products. 
We never know what can be pathogenic element in the system arise. 
Just last year on the island of Reunion discovered the Chikungunya virus, which is similar to West Nile virus is transmitted by blood bodnutím insects. 
There is a need to be constantly wary, "continued Dr. Décaryová and stresses that in addition to secure supply must HEMA-Québec also count on an adequate supply. 
" Needs to grow because the population ages. 
As a result agresivnějšího treatment of cancer patients often need a new batch of red blood cells or platelets. 
An aging population also has implications for the network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% Québečanů eligible for donation. " 
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but may donate blood only once every 56 days to is six times a year. 
14% of people offering blood is taken, on average, because they are carriers such as AIDS or malaria, and if you visit a country where řádí mud fever, are excluded for one year. 
"With these 3%, we can maintain the state which meets the needs of hospitals. 
Deficiencies are very rare. 
The network of donors, it should be complementary in proportion to how age and can no longer donate blood. 
But persuading people to give blood It is difficult, in particular, is to maintain and encourage to become regular donors. 
Life is now so unbridled that they rarely find the time to be able to donate blood, "a posteskne Francine Décaryová. 
With an annual budget of 297 million U.S. dollars HEMA-Québec provides not only the blood products, but also human tissue such as bone transplants, heart valves, skin and eyeball, which is almost exclusively used for large burns. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are deposited with the HEMA-Quebec, which also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
Umbilical cord, which was previously regarded as biomedical waste flows with blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia. 
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousand deposit a sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank and assume that they will take more than one thousand a year. 
At the beginning of next year we should start offering for transplantation," explains dr. Décaryová that the collection of blood from the umbilical cord cord described as very popular. 
"Some mothers are disappointed that not have access to it," because HEMA-Québec does not have sufficient funds to enable the comprehensive and expensive program to offer to all hospitals in Quebec.

Charest is counting on North 
The prime minister does not mean that by the end of 
cause early elections. Immediately after the congress of the Liberal Party (Parti liberal) with Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today's by-election stands the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left). 
"Off limits our last big northern border" is a long-term ambition of Jean Charest yesterday presented visually intriguing manner at the end of the congress Liberal Party in Quebec Levis, without, however, said details. 
During his speech were behind his back screened images in a sort of image grinder. 
On three canvas running obrovitých loop with remarkable films hydroelektrických dams, mines, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps, charts, etc. 
Generous funding, as in the run. 
At a press conference the prime minister also refused to rule out that in the autumn raised early elections, although pointed out that it has a very full agenda. 
"North plan" constitutes the fourth dimension "vision" that the prime minister intends to Quebec, the vision of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on the labor force, the Convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario. 
Despite the opening of the north - the northern territory of the 49th parallel - Prime Minister recently, often mentioned in their declarations, has never been the subject of a presentation. 
Prime Minister, however, been limited to that explain why the North is a "jewel, with a huge potential", but did not date, the amount of investment, and a clear priority in future projects. 
No more than mention a few of the items which could be further developed: in particular, hydroelectric power, wood, but the mining sector, encourage the growth of rapidly developing countries and the rehabilitation of public infrastructures. 
North, according to Charestova list contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds." 
This' territory twice the size of France is with us "," in Quebec. 
And not just for us but in us, "stressed as if he wanted to show that it relies on certain national promotional myth. 
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, Prime Minister highlighted: pursuit gold in the Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay. 
"It is our, it's our future," he added, after theatrically got to see a huge map in his back. 
North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes part of Labrador to Quebec always requested, the Prime Minister stated during the press conference. 
"This is a traditional position, which repeated all the previous governments. 
There is a border line, which has long absence Convention, and if there is a suitable opportunity, on behalf of the Government to take this position again," suggested. 
Otherwise, "it is in the context of climate change also need to rethink our vision of the North", said about the transition north-west, which is due to melting glaciers will open year-round. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy territory becomes an obligation. 
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, and the Inuit peoples of the original? 
The prime minister said that the Quebec government to them will be very carefully and that the project will be beneficial, especially young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (pequistický former member of the Ungavy) have begun negotiations with about thirty communities. 
Activity launched inter-committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which the important position of Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources). 
The prime minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summit," but when "will be outlined a common vision." 
Development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
North plan will be jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly, "he promised. 
Jean Charest described the "vision" as smoothly follow-up to the vision liberal prime ministers, who prevent. 
"Just as liberals who prevent us, we have to change their mindsets in order to call turned into new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was also one of the issues still přetřásaných weekend, which was launched on Friday a large cocktail prominent 50th of the onset of Jean Lesage in the forefront of the parties. 
One of the resolutions proposed to překřtít Beauharnoisovu headquarters to Adélard-Godboutovu dam. 
"From Godbouta who founded the Hydro-Quebec, through the Lesage, who carried out the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of water power to Bourassu who created James Bay, our party will be able to build for the future," said Jean Charest. 
At a press conference referring to another authority, this conservative, so as to the "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, prime minister between 1957 and 1963. 
When the series came on the dam hydro-Eastmain1a ruper, Charest emphasized that its launch is planned for 2012. 
"I just between us, but I plan to be there," entrusted with their membership, which has given rise to considerable applause. 
The same prime minister who in April said that in the 2008 elections will not be, and certainly not in 2009, did not even raise the possibility of elections in the autumn of this year, which allows law. 
However, stressed that his program is charged, particularly the federal Board of Missions in China and the summit of Quebec-New York. 
Weekend boss of Liberals congress provided a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to amend the constitution, which have undergone very smoothly: PLQ (Quebec Liberal Party) calls for particular recognition of the specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
Hopes also that Quebec has appointed members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting, who would have the right to veto decisions taken in the case of Quebec. 
From the opposition plan was in its North main features adopted skeptical. 
Šéfka PQ (Parti québécoise) Pauline Maroisová again pulled out a policy development north of Quebec, which Landryho government launched in 2001. 
According to her, when the government of Liberals received in 2003 the power to abandon the implementation of this policy. 
If it přidržela, "we were away," noted Maroisová alongside its candidates in the Jean-Talon (where elections take place today) Françoise Mercureové. 
ADQ said that encourage the adoption of the Plan North in the government. 
"We wish, however, that this was not just theater," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Mary Dumont, who have returned from holidays. 
Letters - Zneuctěná country 
It was Vic Toews, exministr "Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper Cabinet, who last summer allowed the Louise Arbor said that for Canada "shame". 
Thus dishonor a woman who has led the continued fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells many of the premiere surroundings as well as Stephen Harper itself. 
We have a government, which alone of all Western countries nepřevezla back to his home state of zavřeného concentration camp in Guantanamo. 
Government, which never fell that at a time when they played acts that are alleged against him was Omar Khadr mladičkým adolescents. 
The only government that despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies his word and leaves rot under inhumane conditions of child soldier. 
One that relies on parody of justice, to consider the defendant guilty. 
It is noted that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Association of Canadian lawyers defend the repatriation of Omar Khadr to Canada to get a fair trial. 
The same government closing its eyes to the torture: it matters little that this young man is henceforth psychologically destroyed, and no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture. 
Not realize it, but we have just witnessed the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", words which Harper swipes and many of his mouth sounds so empty. 
The time has come, when there is no morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, poorly handled with care, imprison them under license Boss has a minority government (as will be after the Oct. 14 ...). 
Many voters believe that will rescue the party that preaches morality, law and order: to see that the government is deprived of what had been a reputation and dignity of our country. 
Is a disgrace, sir Toewsi, in this waiver, and not elsewhere. 
Opinions - Orwellovský discourse company Barrick Gold 
In the edition of 17 September published a letter to the duty Patrick J. Garvera, Executive Vice-President of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold. 
With orwellovskou logic confirms that the largest gold producer in the world, began the prosecution of the three authors and chudičkého a small publishing house for slander in order to provoke "a transparent public debate" and requires them six million. 
It is true that judges are independent and impartial, nesoudí the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for slander, but the law. 
It is no surprise that this crucial distinction Garver completely ignoring. 
Or perhaps for Barrick Gold the best way to lead public debate, beggar anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position? 
Whether the process goes any way, authors and the publisher of the book Canada Noir (Black Canada) will be forced to spend impressive sums to be prepared to defend and fight in a very unheard combat military lawyers supported almost bezednými pockets of mining companies. 
Tactic in these outstanding fighting often lies in the ruined defendants in order to promote conciliation, which zacpe mouth of the counterparty and, in addition podes anyone who would dare to pay this matter. 
If the company Barrick Gold really wanted public debate should look at the whole thing to present public opinion. 
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where it operates Barrick Gold, Canada is a debate under normal circumstances the exchange of ideas, and not in ranách me with the electric truncheon. 
Mining companies, therefore, not enough than to open their books, their documentation and establish a genuine debate through the newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams, which could bring the matter to light. 
Barrick Gold, however, it seems, does not have confidence in the public opinion and wholesale rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada. 
Maybe Garver could explain what may require "public debate", while the views of the same public scorn? 
It seems that this word in the world viceprezidentově indicates only bold-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians, it is very restricted concept of the concept. 
In a democracy have the right to speak and calumniator. 
Barrick Gold not - or does not understand - that the public, which supports authors and publishers Noir Canada do so primarily because it rejects the brutal methods of mining companies. 
Barrick public is ready to hear and consider the matter, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, but in the context of what many perceive as the prosecution, which should be the defendant stoppage mouth (as part of its prosecution of "public debate" by way of Barrick has made an official call Canada Noir authors, that they officially announced that they stop using the term ...). 
Apart from the surreálný Garverův speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of inquiry and the search for truth, which are essential for any democratic society. 
Overall, denies the right of quoting reliable sources, and debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the intellectual activity itself. 
If in a country such as Canada, impossible to study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of the world, without the out repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do? 
If the company Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create if guided by scientific standards, using the authors Noir Canada. 
Has the right to reply. 
University environment, which appropriately, has been able to drive the debate and disagreement and conflict resolution. 
Excessive application of Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what was claimed, has the slightest taste of lead transparent debate. 
For the university world is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to adopt measures to this type of unjustified prosecution limited. 
Operation to rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans will mean 
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and democracy, yesterday finally reached agreement on the largest economic rescue plan from a crisis of the thirties years. 
The new version of the plan, how to use 700 billion U.S. dollars hamper the financial crisis, which has already months buffet Wall Stre must still be approved by both chambers of Congress. 
In particular, include: better control of elected representatives of its applications, new mechanisms to ensure repayment imposed by public money, new measures to capture the quantity of houses confiscated because of default and the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers zachraňovaných companies. 
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, and Representative Nancy Pelosiová Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after two-day negotiating marathon. 
"We made progress and we have reached an agreement to be effective in the markets," said Representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat. 
"This is a crucial point: if they do, trauma, chaos and disruption of everyday life of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg. 
During the last hours of negotiations launched at a maximum tilt of the fear of the effect of what should be another failure to temper investors. 
Specified time limit was the opening of markets this morning. 
Both candidates for U.S. President were invited to negotiate later, and both expressed more of an agreement, without, however, failed to express its dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such extreme solutions. 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama added a supplement agreement on certain measures, particularly aimed at facilitating the maintenance of resident owners, and wage labor leaders State salvage companies. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take special precautions because of irresponsibility of some people is not what you congratulate. 
These measures are necessary," explained on the television waves. 
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station, whether it will vote in favor of the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so." 
"Gross features that I read, [shows] that it is a something that everyone will have to spend and what it will be possible through further progress. 
Choose inaction is simply unacceptable, "he said. 
700miliardového aim of the plan is to purchase for cash payers and doubtful debts risk and not for sale assets of U.S. financial institutions. 
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis rozpoutané prasknutím bubbles in the real estate market, which initially led to the collapse high-risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then shifted to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and degradation of banks and financial institutions. 
Fall first draft of the agreement last week are responsible for Republican members. 
From the time when Democrats held that under certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, the government will only guarantee, but neodkoupí is, there is a belief that the impasse is avoided. 
In order to approximate the opposing views in Congress have been accompanied by a measure stipulating that the government will be able to introduce new charges that it helped to get their deposit back, if as a result of the program will have to take losses for five years. 
The new plan envisages the first deposit amount of EUR 250 billion, which it will be possible to add a further 100 billion if the president deemed necessary. 
Deposit additional 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote. 
In return for its assistance Washington acquires shares in the salvage business to him if profits are paying dividends, which will be able to re-sell it to be over. 
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures related to the seizure of real estate loans, which the plan applies, as well as set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to executives of affected companies. 
Architect of the plan would be happy to undergo vote in the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all the effort expended is not yet certain whether the plan will be green. 
Yesterday, namely against this project continues to raise voices in both the Republican and the democratic camp. 
"It is clear that Washington can not hear you," said Republican voters to address Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
Poplatnících however, make a solution is not." 
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed "the Committee Skeptics", the whole thing presents a different, but there is the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred-weighted economics professors, among them three Nobel Prize winners, we wrote: ask Congress to hurry and too closely examined by way of the issue," he said yesterday. 
In the same period in Europe once again confirmed that this is a crisis of the world. 
At the end of an extraordinary meeting of the three countries announced the partial nationalization Benelux banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD). 
Intervention of governments Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it withdraws from the purchase of its konkurentky, which is on the brink of collapse since lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) as a result of the crisis risk loans for the purchase of properties in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people, is among the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"About this money come," said Dutch Finance Minister yesterday Wouter Bos. 
"In return, obtain the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
And that savers and households in today's uncertain times can appreciate." 
On the other hand, the English Channel yet, it seems, the British government launched a nationalization other banks affected by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press the government to take over all existing bank loans and Bringley Bradford, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) accounted for loans to buy real estate. 
According to the notice yesterday repurchased its branches and accounts of clients of British banks Spanish bank Santander. 
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank Northern Rock after the British government has since the beginning of the financial crisis nationalize. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death socially engaged 
icons. Its beauty with a long azurovýma sight of his ace, according to other weakness. 
Vymanil the American actor with a charming smile from narcisizmu? 
Yes and no. 
Stydlivost, sensitivity and endless talent to it's own, it also away from the power category, which produces real stars. 
But what has been a long runner on the track! 
Paul Newman died on Friday in the 83 years to his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons fat years of American cinema. 
Less spectacular than Brando, who was like a long time was sort of his rival on the big screen, Newman was conscious actor, certainly křehčím, but also the apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions. 
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and the mother of origin Maďarka. 
From these roots of Europe was born one of the famous face of the American dream. 
Without exaggerated ego, the latest sign of quality. 
Because it is watching all of this country in love with self made manager, the fighter in the war in the Pacific, injured in the battle to start 50th years, he studied acting at Yale, then attended New York Actor's Studio, and celebrated a triumph in the theater, on television and soon in the film. 
The same man who fought for civil rights, was also the car competitor, which is second place at 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1979, while the sex symbol, and despite the fact that since 1958 constituted a perfect couple with actress Joanne Woodwardovou . 
With him leaving the drawback of this hidden place, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the uproar his own show-business, which will remain forever mysterious to a certain extent. 
A decent man in nejvznešenějším sense. 
Leaving Paul Newman this weekend caused dizziness film lovers, while its major role of competing black canvas of memories. 
Defiluje after more than half a century constantly changing American seventh art. 
In memory reappear charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the hot roof, the adaptation of Tennesseeho Williams 1958. 
For the less distant past (1990) have Decorating the sensitive Mr. Bridge, zneklidněného in advanced age marriage, which failed to fulfill all expectations. 
So many other Paul Newman came into history. 
Boxer Rocky Graziano, ztýraný, violent, unforgettable offender from Somebody Up There likes Me (In a sign of hatred) Robert Wise, the role of designated for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956, Newman said the real knowledge. 
Likable gangster in absolutely great The Sting (trick), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Embittered and vengeful billiard player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure ztvární in The Color of Money Martina Scorseseho, which will bring him in 1987, one of seven Oscar nominations. 
This face putující ever, it was on. 
And on. 
In his career by competing different era. 
Young knows it thanks kultovnímu Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) of the role Reggieho Dunlop, a non-hockey coach. 
Fans are with him again met in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coenových. 
His career he has concluded the role of the Irish mafia godfather in the Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003. 
Unlike several film legend that relatively soon left the craft, Newman remained in the business a long time, even with its practitioners Hollywood glitz, pomp and concessions. 
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier him, but not without humor, considered "a live call underplayingu, judging that in their performance too saw his presidency. 
For the beautiful Paul Newman, which came as the role of the plate was not always so něžná profession. 
The first lovers, however, played less frequently than outsiders: neurotic, alcoholics, lump and zoufalce of backsliding and rebellion as reflected in its perfect features. 
As a director of Newman revealed the little-known site shy of its sensitivity. 
His film Rachel, Rachel, 1968 (in accordance with Canadian Margaret Laurenceové novel), which played a major role his wife, Joanne Woodwardová, filed a sensitive portrait of female full of melancholy. 
His son Scott, who lost to overdose, dedicated in 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sorrow. 
In a rush of honors, which yesterday received Newman, his great friend and former fellow Robert Redford (playing together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sorrowfully said: "His presence was my life and this country better." 
Magnanimity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of the deceased actor. 
Apart from the his legendary career, also leaves a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, opponents of the bankruptcy of Hollywood. 
His podobiznu we were accustomed to seeing on the bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, to sušenkách and other foods that we may seem quite nevkusné, although initially a gag. 
However, gains from the sale went to the account of the Foundation for difficult childhood. 
Newman is, rather than the left cradle glory to the last moment engaged in society. 
Their five daughters left a letter containing the following sentence: "Always and until the end of your father was grateful his happy planet. 
It was my honor that I could be there." 
And we were allowed to watch the honor career as jasnozřivého and velkodušného American artist. 
And besides, after all, vzorného citizen. 
What is produced in the factory invoice on Zuschlag &amp; spol.? 
Soon, 8 october, begin trial in criminal proceedings conducted against Janos Zuschlag and his associates. 
Policies and his associates are among other offenses, including forgery of documents, accused of fraud against the long-term and systematic criminal organization, which has caused an extremely significant damage. 
According to prosecution used the money gained in contests for their own purposes and meet the challenges often dokládali fiction invoices. 
Money from the state and local governments - the sum of approximately 65 million forint - traveled to partially fund the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part, into the pockets of individuals. 
The manner in which informed the investigating authority, was that the money gained in contests have been selected on the basis of invoices for which there is no real consideration, and the underwriting liabilities societies never to comply. 
According to the indictment of a large number of false invoices. 
The forms of these invoices came from józsefvárosského market, round stamp was produced in Kiskunhalas. 
It names the company has a production run of invoices, it was decided, inter alia, on sightseeing tour of the northern coast of Balaton, which was sent by István Ladose Janos Zuschlag. 
According to his testimony will be the former vyhlédnout guest houses and restaurants. 
These called for accounts for its consumption, according to the model were then produced invoices submitted under the public tender is printed, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, respectively, the City Authority. 
Invoices exhibited mostly István LADOSE with his partner András Őrim, which according to our information, most often written reports required to obtain subsidies. 
In its "study the way" I looked LADOSE one beer hall. 
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, to the hospitality facilities catering for the association of devadesátičlennou group Biztos Pont. 
So many people would, however, according to the leading companies in this facility at the same time for Debian. 
Likewise hemžila formal and content errors invoice issued in the summer of 2002 the Foundation named Jövőért jobs, and later Együtt Harmadik Évezredért. 
Guest House in Badacsonytomaji had had only three rooms, more than ten people there could not sleep a night, but it was stated on the invoice one hundred and thirty guests. 
Vyplňovatelé forms with a rich fantasy that this too, even when placed on evidence the company is also dedicated to hospitality - Pigal Ltd., which accounts according to information provided by the prosecution documents denominated in the name of jobs and Jövőért Hoppe nor nefigurovaly. 
Head of the company for hvg.hu Győző Farkas said that when he was summoned to the prosecution and showed him the invoice immediately knew that the false documents. 
"The name of our company and our tax code has been on the stamp in the wrong place." 
He added, in addition to the formalities or disagreed that, according to invoices checked one hundred people have had only eleven rooms, which do not have as much capacity. 
Moreover, it was stated on the invoice also catering, with their restaurants for a long time does not work. 
Zealous manufacturers invoices are unconvinced or that destined Budapest travel agency organizes the only foreign travel, and invoice payment in cash, which is also agreement with the company billing practices, said foolishly as the mediation service trips around Hungary. 
In addition, as revealed in the course of the investigation, said in the VAT, while organizing trips to countries outside the European Union was Exempt from VAT. 
Four documents issued by the Foundation jobs Jövőért Hotel Révfülöp Ltd. disagreed among other things, or the amount of VAT. At the company has not indicated 25procentní but 15procentní VAT Furthermore, the hotel staff exhibited a printed invoices, produced an invoice has been written by hand. 
In addition, destroy "publishers' invoice to be that for one company said, as became apparent by the Public Prosecutor's Office investigation, carried out activities such as road transport of goods by the company based on the original investment advice did not. 
That the invoices issued by the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and associations XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, the addition provalilo because of the formal variations - neodpovídajícímu format invoices and nepravému stamp. 
As in the case of Ravenna pieces Sports or camp in Kunfehértó whose leaders denied that the invoices out by them. 
Forger, for example, notice or that the company Hib Ltd. of Nyíregyháza was at the time (2001), when it stravovala group of the Association Fiatal Városért, in liquidation, because according to our information up Commissioner company also denied that the paper issued on . 
Invoices exhibited knowingly 
The second group consists of invoicing those who know that they expose the fictitious invoice. 
Foundation gerhard Budapestért issued accounts for roughly four million forint for the Foundation Harmadik Évezredért at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. 
Head of Collab Ltd. prompted prosecution under the fictitious account to one of the defendants Ludovic Györfy. 
The Zuschlag and its partners also cooperated company Biogate Ltd., is currently in liquidation, which in 2003 zásobila Foundation jobs Jövőért and associations Atlasz and Vörösfenyő invoices with a value of around five million forint for which there is no real economic activity. 
Or the movement of money, because the invoices were created later canceled, which I forget, however, the organization noted in its papers. 
In the other groups invoicing companies include those that have links to the accused. 
So, for instance, Iván Kubátová authorized representative Ukrainian agent of Delta Trió Ltd., engaged in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, headquartered in Budapest, where the company is not, however, to find. 
The company issued in October, November and December 2005, several invoices for the sale of computer technology funds in the amount of approximately 18 million forint. 
According to data investigation found they bought kiskunhalasská Cash Investment Company Ltd., which was from 14 September 2005 in liquidation. 
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, which had in the years 2002-2005 to transmit documents relating to the company also Iván Kubátová. 
As we know, Kubátová during the investigation acknowledged that the invoices issued on behalf of the associations Atlasz, Hoppe and the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and he accepted their consideration. 
Expressly at the request of Ivan Kubátová the Romanian masons based company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment pc 
But in fact, neither one of the companies had not worked, according to the defendant because they can not work. 
Still, it was business benefit, because at the request of spoluobviněného lawyer Zsolt Szenteho to prepare their founding document, issued invoices on behalf of companies and associations Atlasz Y-generation connected to Zuschlag. 
Investment on behalf of companies, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubátová organizations total of 15 invoices with a value of 14.2 million forint. 
Prosecution Service decided that it will Kubátová came to 10 percent of the amounts listed on the invoices and VAT. 
The issue of fictitious invoices, this time for tender for the organizations Biztos Pont, the company also benefited from man-Szi Beri 
kt. Compatriot Y-generations and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért filed in January 2006 proposals to public tender Foundation Mihálye Táncsics (TMA), public interest organizations Socialist Party. 
Received 500 thousand forint, but the amounts have invested the objectives set out in the draft. 
Went to clear five TMA submitted fictitious invoices from Team Works Ltd. 
These factors were also found during a search in the office Árpád Kemecseiho the Ministry of Education. 
During the trial of the defendants are likely to describe the production of invoices, as was done at the prosecution. 
May be more interesting, if it decides to reveal itself all the main accused Janos Zuschlag. 
His previous testimony is not too detailed, and although several have already promised that all out at length, yet did so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forint, with the Socialists may have entered into an agreement and it will take Zusi at you. 
He is also yet to even insult, because his request for relaxation of the conditions of his detention, namely the placing under house arrest, far remained unanswered. 
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, which cause much greater damage, which has neuhradili, are free to browse, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings conducted against them in their own homes, on this option was not available. 
Ruff psychology: why spend more money? 
At auction customers are willing to spend more money, to revalue the goods. 
Nervous and economic fundamentals of a well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior was able to detect investigators in the field of neurology and economics New York University. 
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to type in the competition behind eBay auction, so that better pay and too high a price. 
Research using experimental auction tried to map out the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system. 
One group of volunteers to plant, the second group participated in the auction feature, which has been using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) investigated the active area of the brain of experimental people. 
In both games participants can win money, but playing at auction, which is an important element trump the other hand, started in prohrávání intensive work unit located under the bark brain, called the striatum. 
This brain region plays in addition to many other functions in the role of "sebeodměňovacím" mechanism of the nervous system. 
Vyšroubování prices should therefore be explained according to researchers aimed at avoiding a violent reaction striata. 
To support the theory of its members carried out the research team of economists from the financial cross-sectional investigation. 
When it under different conditions licitovaly against one partner three groups. 
The control group was simply told what is the fair value of the product, and they made the bet. 
Members of other groups have also been promised that, if come from the game victoriously, receive remuneration for 15 dollars. 
The third group was given 15 U.S. dollars on the contrary, before the auction, but in the event of losses came by its members as well as the money. 
The difference between the two groups was therefore seems everywhere that has been highlighted one win and a second loss. 
Members of the group playing "against failure" but were willing to go higher than it was in control and "winning" the group, confirming the hypothesis neurology. 
"These results can not be deduced from any pre-existing economic theories. 
They had yet to explain phenomena observable in the auctions joy of victory and vyhýbáním the risk. 
Neurological imaging methods to help us resolve the conflict between these two theories, so that we have now reached the third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics Faculty of New York University. 
Hepatitis: when your doctor? 
Around half a billion people around the world suffering from a chronic infection of hepatitis B or C, Hungary is the chronic liver disease appear among the main causes of death. 
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. Reason is that patients are often unaware that they are infected. 
Name of hepatitis is a summary of identifying the infectious liver damage caused by different viruses. 
In their symptoms are many similarities, it is symptomatic hepatitis and jaundice, but the originator of illness and disease is caused by them differed from one another. 
Hepatitis viruses, according to the agent spread in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E digestive device (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses, blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva) . 
Travelers should in any case have to protect the vaccination against the virus A and B virus type C vaccine does not exist. 
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually are accompanied by nausea, weakness, difficulty lap, the urge to vomiting. 
Then the skin and whites of your eye creates jaundice, turns lighter stools and dark urine. Treatment may take two to three weeks. 
Die each year worldwide million people on the serious nature of this disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B 
The main reason is that, according to estimates, it is only every ten infected medikamentózně treated. 
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
Most infected about their illness or knows agent destroys liver cells insidiously, and the first symptoms appear, in many cases to be 20-30 years old. 
Therefore, it is very important and timely prevention, the implementation of regular screening. 
In three groups, the disease occurs much more frequently than the average: between people who prior to 1991 period, blood transfusion, drug users and among people with tetováním. 
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with a virus chronic hepatitis C 200 million. 
Since the disease can prove the routine laboratory tests should be one where the record any sign of unknown origin, contact your general practitioner. 
In the early detection of disease is treatable, the virus can remove from the body to put a stop to infectiousness and prevent cancer. 
30th September, the world day of hepatitis, which was representing the sick for the first time the world organized in 2004. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by such viruses, the causes of its creation and the importance of early detection of disease. 
Who believe in God, that it hurt so much? 
According to the results of recent research works faith in God as some analgesic, which could ulehčovat death of the Catholic mučedníkům. 
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment studied how the human faith in God affects the perception of pain, informed the British daily newspaper Telegraph. 
In the context of a rather bizarre poll undergone 12 Catholic believers and atheist the same number of electric shocks while all the observed painting depicting the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results of Catholic faithful were able to exclude a large part of the pain. 
Thanks to technology, exploring in detail the human brain has been shown by the fact that Catholics were able to activate that part of his brain, which is responsible for regulating pain. 
Research is the first of a series of research, which, in addition to academics involved scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university. 
The whole test was so that the left-hand experimental body put aglitter tool, which give electric shocks. 
Researchers asked the participants attempt to stare observed two paintings: Sassoferratovu Virgin Mary coming from the 17th century and a lady with an Ermine Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century. 
The authors of the research had hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary for the faithful cause a state of piety, while da Vinci's chosen because they are from the same and act according to them, reassuring impression. 
Experimental players spend half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this period were given in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshock, while separately monitor image with religious or general topics. 
Catholics reported that in view of the Virgin Mary felt "safe" as if it has been "taken care of" and "soothe to be filled with peace." 
When viewing a picture with a religious theme feel of his observations about 12 percent less pain than before when it had Leonardo's work. 
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any highly impressive images even an atheist, but it is necessary to find a good photo. 
"We had to find an image that will be viewed very positively, from a position of the mother or father," said psychologist. 
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
'Practice of faith should change and, in many cases also change our personality, "added Wright. 
After such great results it is only a matter of what the effect on the regulation of pain believers should, if they show a Madonna or a painter like Leonardo caliber. 
Meant to look at the quality of the Virgin Mary achieve even better results? 
Are you what side of the podělíš 
About his birthday desátých Google may declare that people can find it in your pocket at least as well as the sky over their heads, they know where they were on vacation, go to the professional examinations and what is interested. 
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the heads of companies, but still not enough. 
But in terms of Skeptics, do parallels with orwellovskou dark vision, it is not clear to the very nature of Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt has recently expressed for the daily newspaper Financial Times that Google's main aim is to collect about users even more personal data, which is necessary to enable the founders of Google can keep its original plan, which was: "Organize all the information in the world!" 
According to zpovídaného leaders Google stands firm after ten years světoborné work only at the beginning that could work with any information. 
On the question of what will be in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like, if Google was able to answer questions like "what can I do tomorrow?" or "what work would be really suitable for me?" - On such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to respond until the user will not know enough information. 
Not all users of the Internet, we know that the internet search accurately recorded as search terms, and to what IP addresses have been searched and which pages are candidates for the search moved. 
With Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their surfing history, may be back to see what sought and what clicked, which is then in the long run generate more adapted to the findings directly to them - the same logic will be based Recommendations and service, through which our system will be based on the previously mentioned retained preferences and offer products and services. 
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks, how I deal with? - Ask users who are looking at the data Google monopoly fear. 
In most cases, operates much more scope to the potential represented by the company, does not backlash in Internet users aware of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against authority. 
However, it confirmed the fact that all the search terms are not collected, but in justified cases may also be issued by a third party in such legal cases moral rights of Internet users does nothing. 
The most famous recent example was about coordinated action against the Brazilian pedofilům during which Google has provided Brazilian government information that allowed the identification of the pedophile community site Orkut, run through it. 
Internet users who fear the moral rights, however, could still breathe a sigh of relief in May when the company goes hand in hand with organizations to protect electronic rights EFF successfully managed its right in a dispute with the FBI: Google may not be so in the future, nor any article constitution forced to provide any information requested by the FBI secretly. 
(At the same time the federal government successfully vybojovala nearly fifty thousand Web addresses and a thousand search terms that gained with reference to the strengthening of years ago adopted a law on the protection of children, but nevertheless failed to get lists of wanted items to individual users or complete lists of Web sites and keyword, including a period of two months.) 
View on Google is quite contradictory: it is flogging those who fear the provision of their personal data, because it feels that the intimate sphere and private life will that start to use the Google service, subject to injury, and act against it with the revolt of the belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image. 
And yet American geek culture and its wild arm, incorporates enthusiastic around computer fans, activists and people emerging in many countries, it sees a new generation of velkofirem, "Corporation, now what is trendy, unlike its rival Microsoft, to be considered for Windows as the Conqueror the world, although both fighting for the same objectives. 
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft does not require its users' identification code and wants them money for their applications, open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package programs act as a much more accessible, mladistvější, "coolovější" than Practice is the official software giant. 
However, it may be due to the fact that geekové accurately understand very problematic relationship of the Internet and personality, which has brought just one of the keyword last nejskloňovanějších years: Web 2.0. 
Web 2.0 is not about anything other than the cooperation that behind deliberately let the track and use the communication channels that are available, and although their range of each other, the essence remains the same: the show. 
The average young person can now keep a profile on several community pages from Facebook after s Xanga, you can still connect with other services, such as Twitterem or applications last.fm, recording his Listened to music, all you can connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, moreover, can write a blog, which will automatically discover its latest gallery, which saves on Flickr or Picasa. 
In doing so we can learn about many of exemplary cases involving itself: a friend of the morning looking at the flood of pictures of common friends easily come to, who's delusional friend spent the evening, or it may throw its workers just because its their vylíčí Blog sincere opinion on the top leadership: one thing is clear, the concept of private life is now completely re-evaluated. 
He who lives online life consists of what the show itself, so we can define the basic argument behind the behavior of today's youth. 
And who wants to hide something, or at least avoid googlovskému monopoly, has the option (to be starting Scrooglem, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately leaving traces). 
Considerable number of people on purpose, for example, does not register on the community site that they can not be found.

Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, even though the Czechs the Warsaw Stock Exchange from heading potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange had previously excluded. 
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the State. 
99 percent of the shares is in the hands of the Polish State, who wishes to 60 percent of the securities in a few months to sell. 
How to write the Czech economic daily newspaper E15, Poles offer represents the highest amount that was interested in the Prague Stock Exchange has offered. 
According to the Czech sheets submitted yet offer Vienna stock exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.

For the global financial catastrophe, we can thank the U.S. president, raises allegations Rome La Repubblica. The president has not been able or even rally his own party in support of that hastily splácaného a bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation ... 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which resembled a billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we can talk more about the latter 11th September. 
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington. 
In the view of the newspaper El Mundo has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse of its lack of political leadership. 
The risk of collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to grow, which will ultimately pay for the entire world. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, however, there is a risk that Washington will not offer political solution to the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism. 
Threat may no longer be ignored, notes Geneva daily newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. 
Individual countries can not throw money vrávorajícím institutes lifebuoy and taxpayers can save them from ruin.

In the long term, it is necessary that the European Union Member States have transferred through its national egoism and unified control over the fragmented financial markets. 
Just on Monday were postonávající financial institutions more than 100 billion euros, recalls the Vienna Der Standard, under which they are concerned that, like the Americans will need in order to address the crisis dig deep into your pockets and the European taxpayer, is still realistic.

Smart car mimics years 
bumble bees. What am I going to be the best method to prevent the development of technology capable of collision, if not imitation detectors obstacles encountered in the world of nature? 
For example, honey bees. 
The idea of starting a strategic surprise project presented at CEATEC Japan's Fair, vnukli engineers from the firm Nissan bumble bees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems prevent collisions. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University biomimetický Nissan built robotic system of the type BR23C, robotized miniauto, which is equipped with features bees, with the ultimate objective of helping create a system that can eliminate all deductions. 
"During the flight, each bee produces its own personal space, oblong shape, which is actually very similar to our security protective packaging," explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General signs for the technology industry and research and development. 
The important role played by compound eyes that allow včelám see in all directions in the visual angle of more than 300 degrees. 
The copied features a complex eye reached after engineers idea of laser rangefinder. 
He identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters before BR23C in the field of vision 180 degrees, calculated their distance and sends a signal cabin microprocessor, which is immediately transformed in the operation in order to avoid a collision. 
Obstacle is detected during the fraction of a second, then begins to mimic the movements of robot-car bees and turning the wheel to the extent necessary to avoid a collision immediately changes direction. 
Unlike any existing system that runs výhybný maneuver completely instinctive way. 
"If it were not so, the robotic car failed to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Tošijuki Ando, head of the Laboratory of mobility and the robotic car. 
Must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology meets the most vulnerable and the innermost layer of security protection package, inside which the deduction is currently regarded as inevitable. 
The whole process should reflect what makes the bee to avoid further včelám. 
This process may take longer than the blink of an eye. 
However, unlike the bees can not move towards the up, down or diagonally, it may be only two-dimensional and only in the direction from which you can rotate the wheel. 
Instead of endless possibilities that the avoidance offer včelám and in the case of robotic cars applied only option otáčivého movement, acceleration and deceleration. 
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have higher energy density, which means that they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion options. 
According to Ando is important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability of processing, the less the storage of data. 
This mechanism must prepare and respond to only a few incoming signals per second. 
There is no need to retain and responded by using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, being used only on the memory size of a few kilobytes. 
Does not need memory GIGA-or megabajtovou capacity. 
This is the first step towards the development of technologies for the immediate avoidance, which is estimated to Nissanu to get into mass-produced cars in ten years. 
Another option exercise may be a link units are GPS satellite navigation system, which would avoid the obstacles lying in the road led motorists to set up the final goal. 
Damn precious child already has a name 
Law on the package to rescue the economy with a value of 700 billion U.S. dollars to be divided into several tranches with a view to purchase bad loans of banks, it is in writing. 
In the first round will be used half the amount. 
After further negotiations, which ended up on Saturday after midnight U.S. eastern time, congressional leaders reached an agreement in a few days-long debate on the rescue package with a total value of 700 billion U.S. dollars, informed Reuters. 
"We have reached an important progress," announced Nancy Pelosiová, President of the Democratic House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to the drafting of the agreement. 
A compromise on the package supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson on the outcome of compromise, said: "The program will work and be effective, but it is necessary to take further steps." 
Written package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday night at 8 pm Washington time (ie on Monday at two o'clock the morning Central European Time), but no particular increase in the exchanges did not cause. 
The draft rules of law in hearing the name of the law on the emergency economic stabilization in 2008, which has a program to establish, will soon vote on Monday, House of Representatives, then will turn the Senate. 
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosiovou on Saturday night, after reports of an agreement welcomed in the White House. 
"With the progress made in the night, we are very happy and I appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protecting our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratta. 
The program is also different from the original proposal, the Bush administration, which should go to the poor to buy mortgage-backed securities at once spent the entire sum of 700 billion U.S. dollars. 
It is now possible to spend in the first round more than half the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the case is expected on Monday decided Congress, and the Ministry of Finance for them buy securities secured by mortgages, which are classified as poor, the fate of the remaining 100 billion U.S. dollars will depend on the decision of the president. 
The program will be controlled by a specific college, the member will also chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
Spending the second half of 700 billion U.S. dollars will depend on further decisions of Congress. 
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the Act to apply the combined tactics: while it may redeem poor loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages or other "toxic" loans. 
Redemption may take place in the auctions and directly told representatives of the competent ministries. 
Legislation will allow the companies to participate in the insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance to provide guarantee for the funds representing the cause for concern, for which the company will pay a price equivalent to the expected damage. 
As he said to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to be to meet urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system made to 700 billion dollars, whether a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance or preventing systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions. 
"Make the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law immediately be signed," he added. 
Heads of banks, which are in difficulties and waiting to assist state, but can count on the fact that their government will reduce redundancy - which in overseas Slang says simply "golden parachute". 
In order to reduce their salaries is only in certain cases, moreover, these restrictions will depend on how the assistance provided by the Ministry. 
Restrictions essentially means that if the ministry to buy in the auction will be on golden parachutes imposed surtax if padlí Bank directors sent straight to retirement. 
In the case of direct purchase of bad loans aggressively the government steps in order to give money for the leadership have been exaggerated. 
That said, the existing contract for the golden parachutes will not change, limit applies only to new contracts, which should be further incentive to participate in the program. 
"This is the first in American history, which will be in place legal restrictions on the remuneration of the Directors-General," commented committee chairman of the provisions of the Financial Services House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state falls in banks participating in the program right to acquire shares, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and along with it even saved the bank stand on its feet, they can on this transaction and make a profit. 
The plan includes a proposal that in the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress stating how can taxpayers expected losses from the financial sector back. 
On both sides, of course, the voices expressing occurred in the context of the plan in doubt. 
"We ask our American citizens, this is taxpayers' dollars neochrání," said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California. 
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kapturová considers that the adoption of provisions to encourage those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Press Review German language region 
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it became confident - and analyzes the weak CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel. 
Haiderovci are prepared to govern Austria in order to prevent the red-black coalition. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
The Internet edition of leftist German news magazine examines Franz Walter in his article entitled "Bavarian revolution devours his father," the causes of the dramatic defeat CSU. 
According to well-known political erosion CSU have begun a lot sooner than his office has taken over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber. 
Christian Socialists decades renewal of Bavaria - and now they are just divert the modern citizens. 
Rotation period is a problem throughout the Christian-Democratic, and thus Angela Merkel. 
Debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday, ending a process that can be assumed almost exactly ten years: closed undisputed hegemony of one státostrany. 
Already a decade ago, in 1998, landed at CSU 47.7 percent for the first time since the 50th 50procentní years under the limit. 
This happened three years ago when elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still so often připomínaném Stoiberově period. 
This is due to the modernization of the CSU in the country and to consistently implement devours their parents. 
Sociologists to predict now 40 years old, but the pace is very erred. Secularization, the results of education, establishment of Germans from the east and north of the developing regions of Bavaria, however, still could not be without consequences for the loyalty of voters CSU. 
Modernization is associated with growth opportunities, which has seen its political implications. 
Right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it have become confident, critical, svéhlavější. 
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU is far from the most traditional civil layer; people in the free professions, professionals, individuals graduates and higher education. 
Thus they support CSU withered under 40 percent.

The question of whether you can imagine the coalition is MOLTERER Wilhelm, the current chairman ÖVP, as the Vice Chancellor, Faymann left open. 
How to comment, rate-Schüssel MOLTERER was to defeat each fall. 
Repetition of this line is not eligible. 
MOLTERER respond to the red menu carefully.

Járóková: There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
In Paris today, began the summit of equality, which will host France, the current presiding State of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the major professional řečnic deliberations in his message addressed to the plenary turned attention to segregation in education, which is one of the most serious injustice suffered by the Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application. 
Summit opened the conference - on behalf of the French presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
The deliberations sat between invited representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European organizations to safeguard the rights and civil society organizations working in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office a group of MEPs movement Fidesz Járóková pointed out that in addition to discrimination that occurs in the recruitment, Roma are forced out of the labor market mainly due to their low education. 
"The vast majority of young Roma does not have a secondary education and as a result of poor quality basic education can achieve a higher level of education only a small part of them." 
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the implementation of other human rights. 
Investing in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to MEP is a need to strengthen awareness of the context in the widest circles - between Roma and non children. 
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the greater will have a chance to become a productive member of the labor market, through income taxes and excise duties contribute to the national budget. 
"Roma is the right of their citizenship of the European Union need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their quality and not a separate education," stressed Lívia Járóková. 
According to MEP is needed cohesion of the European Union, with an emphasis on objective and in order to accelerate the processes of the immediate desegregation of schools, for this is primarily important to the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-regulation. 
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Roma children the possibility of the democratic space in order to participate as full citizens of the future of Europe," claimed Járóková. 
Each is marked by the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" guarantee objective of the Summit of equality, held annually since the last meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to assist in achieving the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of the whole of Europe as well as individual Member States. 
CSU: temporary grace 
The fate of dosluhujícího duos Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October 
Despite the ignominious electoral debacle has nepadaly head, the debate on the issues of personal attachment of the Bavarian CSU has odročena. 
Party Chairman Erwin Huber and the earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their positions, the question is, till when the pardon will continue. 
The fate of tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss 17procentní votes, decided last October weekend extraordinary party congress. 
Members of a kritizovaného duos in any case, let hear that their positions will not stick of all forces. 
Tried to reassure members of resentful factions and the base, who because of the loss of an absolute majority demanded by the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences. 
Five years ago - the truth, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing on top of their careers - has Christian Social Union, 60.7 percent now, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, but sufficient power to 43.4 percent. 
CSU in Bavaria has been producing 18 percent of German GDP "autocrat" over 46 years old. 
While I continue to have conservatives in the south of the country, which has the key importance of the Hungarian economy, high status, but in the future will be forced to any coalition. 
One of the first letters of reorganization within the party is that the close výzvědného team, which will enter into exploratory discussions concerning a possible coalition government with the Munich liberal FDP, or the rightist-oriented groups to freely voters, will be vice-chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered successor of Huberova as possible. 
It is irony that on the ballot Freedom voters in Assembly got Gabriele Pauliová, whose performance against Stoiber to tap duo Huber-Beckstein to implement the coup, but then with an ambitious local political mercilessly made short shrift. 
CSU leaders now focus all their energy on how to stabilize Becksteina. 
During the transitional period is a active role also Stoiber, who has so far been hatched nitky background, a former prime minister and terrestrial former chairman of CSU called 28th September nejtrpčím day of his political career. 
On Monday Huber utrousil several jízlivých remarks to address the CDU, according to him would have been a sister party deserve much greater support. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted as a warning defeat for the CDU and Merkel. 
After the elections to the Bundestag attributable to the September 2009 with Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor if the CSU, which has played in the national success in 2005 a major role, together somehow stood on his feet. 
According to Merkel, who fiasku difficult to conceal their disappointment, loss of positions will have a negative impact on the CSU Berlin grand coalition. 
This is, of course, relative: treat the wounded CSU will be easier and the crisis of Social Democrats insists on. 
SPD has reached in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946. 
Lukashenko: opposition - 110:0 
In the Sunday elections to the Belarusian Parliament has not been even one opposition member. 
This can be explained according to Russian observers well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) irregularities that occurred during the counting of votes. 
OSCE, which deployed 450 observers from 43 countries, the choice has not. 
Although 110členný legislature 10milionové country lacks the opposition has a well-decade, combined under the name of the opposition United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who left on the basis of changes in the constitution in an election with diskutabilním course in 2006 and the fourth to restore his presidential mandate, this "permit" to the Parliament appeared several opposition MPs. 
ODS as well as refrain from previously considered boycott. 
In the background, the opposition was expected that Russia is still heavily dependent economically Belarus - which has to mitigate the impact of constantly zdražujícího import Russian natural gas to take the credit and help to make the Beltransgaz company, owns gas pipelines through the country into Russia's hands - you wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where the Belarusian political establishment is evaluated as antidemokratické Lukashenko and other senior politicians do not receive an entry permit. 
On the release of previously claimed that the OSCE in evaluating the campaign to put the emphasis on the positive shifts, and not on the shortcomings - such as the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates. 
Monday's flash message OSCE has, however, had reservations and to campaign in which opposition candidates are essentially unable to appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition can not be present at the counting of votes. 
At the same time, you can feel under the opposition in the political system still improve: political prisoners were released on liberty and Minsk is willing to tamper with Moscow and the smaller confrontation, though continues to refuse to recognize Georgia divorced from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, while Russia, with which consists of Belarus on paper the State Union, considers the two territories for a month now independent. 
"We made two steps forward and one back, but most important is that it started a dialogue between Belarus and EU," said Alexander Milinkevich our sheet. 
According to the opposition candidate in presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that it also remains, despite the fact that "the power zalekla go to a single member of Parliament bezvýznamného opposition." 
Looking at the results of the opposition plans to take industrial action, but rather seeks to deliver their message to voters about the need for economic reform. 
"This of course we have a lot of problems, the opposition lists, we must print in Russia, hampering the distribution of local authorities, but even so I can see that change more and more people, including older," said Milinkevich, with reference to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, that his greatest achievement as the creation of social security, not a right or officially supported by most layer of pensioners. 
"Because of the debt the country and the growth of trade deficit is just a matter of time before social security 'navozující quiet cemetery' collapse," the Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition policy evaluated Russian observers as a democratic election. 
Head of Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States Sergey Lebedev Russian news agency Ria Novosti said that "people do not believe the words but deeds", so the absence of the opposition is nothing other than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.

This is a reformism," emphasizes again Brunetta. 
Palace Chigo finish in the establishment of the council buildings. 
Masih is for "the choice of revolving doors of the important and symbolic terms." 
By staff were no objections, assured General Secretary: "It was a common procedure with the staff and the cooperation of all." 
In short, no more breakfast during working hours, no more coffee and croissant. 
Brunetta smiles and says, "there is nothing better the advisory cappuccino at seven hours of the morning." 
During a conference on higher vocational training school for public administration 
in Rome, Minister finally notified that within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease decreased by 50%, which means 60 thousand people a year, more work ". 
and delivers, it is necessary that the Italian public administration became more efficient 
"Pay its dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years has doubled with the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage. 
In the meantime, met ten hundred government employees to reject the standards Brunettova decree in accordance with a request supported Codacons. 
"While the minister for public administration today presents figures on the lower absence at work due to illness - writes the association to protect consumers - the nation 'pilných lazy' continues to grow. 
In Italy we have a productive and fair one thousand employees in public administration, who have rallied To proclaim the war illegitimate standards contained in the decree. " 
Taru to the protest against the exclusion of allowances for sickness, which depends on the activity; extension of time within which it is possible to check the patient, in what timeframe will carry out inspection visits, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "resolutely preventing" 
Every day in Italy, a 2500 work-related accidents, three people die and twenty seven will remain permanently disabled. 
INAIL values confirm that for the year 2007 we have approximately 1200 deaths resulting from accidents at work. 
These values indicative of the seriousness of phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons of death and causes of deaths almost doubled in comparison with the killings. 
In order to re-attracting attention institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrated in all Italian regions 58th National Day of victims of accidents at work provided to the second Sunday in October. 
"Znepokojivá data expanded Anmilem and the same tragic news of the day confirmed as an important issue at work," confirms President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to the president Anmilu, the National Association for the maimed and handicapped for work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
Head of State expressed his admiration for continuous live together on security at places of work, the protection of injured workers, to help families of the victims and the participation of public opinion. ". 
"Naturally it was made outrage 'enough', candidly shared in the face of tragedy that far cause stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality we once again offer dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics." 
Napolitano does not hide that "there clearly exists the problem of resources is critical to invest in training and awareness. 
Special importance of assuming numerous enforcement initiatives in the field of education to young people who face the world of work, obtain a clearer awareness. 
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, to a social concern because of its severity, apply and improve legal standards. 
Chamber of Commerce president Gianfranco Fini, for its part, emphasized "the phenomenon of death as a result of work-related accidents absolutely critical social status, as offends the conscience of each of us and force all institutions of convincing efforts to necessary completion of this state.." 
"Regarding the data on work-related accidents, it seems to show a positive, but does not dispute that the number of deaths resulting from accidents at work is like so alarming," noted the president again Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We just did not want that this" effort to reduce "lead to less attention, because when attention stops, breaks out tragedy. 
" We believe that generally do little more power to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities which may have an impact on this problem. 
It is necessary, in our opinion - stressed Mercandelli - to increase checks and inspections, but also strongly intervene in the training of personnel, and from the school-age ". 
" There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public participation opinion. 
But it is especially a need for greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers against the phenomenon, which represents extraordinary social phenomenon.. " 
Mercandelli finally said that this is a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation for the anticipated work and sacrifice "moving supportive care" to which the system in recent years has.. 
"The aim is thus to return worker guarantee insurance - adding - as fate those who do harm, must not depend on the spontaneity or gifts from time to time legislator. " 
Mp3 Players accused, put the risk of hearing 
Listen to a longer period of loud music, and use portable music devices like MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage. 
According to today published the European Commission, which one official report in Brussels, citing widespread opinion committee for science about the health risks, which recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) Eu. 
"In this scientific opinion - read the notes - shows that 5-10% of those who over a period of at least five years, listen to music using portable music devices, a week more than an hour a day and maintain the high-volume, risking permanent loss of hearing" . 
"It makes me worry that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, may unwittingly harm their hearing irremediably way," admits Meglena Kuneva. 
"The scientific evidence - continues Head - shows a clear risk and need to respond quickly. 
This is the most important is that we must encourage consumers and to disclose such information. 
We continue to review the existing control systems in the light of scientific findings to to become fully effective and in keeping abreast of new technology. " 
Brussels has asked for an independent scientific committee that investigated this issue, given the high use of portable music devices and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of origin. 
"Scientists - closed executive officer Eu - confirm that it should be easy and now the European Commission shall, together with other members of a party that raised the problem of what measures could possibly introduce, and better protect children and young people before issuing the noise, the originator of the portable music device and similar devices. " 
There is already a European safety standard, which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there is a growing concern about the hearing impaired, which may be caused by over-exposure to similar types of noise. 
It is very possible to limit the damage that will seek solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure. 
In its conviction Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable music devices, when used loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceeds current levels corresponding to maximum permitted noise in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions over the longer term, risk after five years of permanent hearing loss. 
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantities may be valued between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU. 
Rome, Alemanno allow the free conduct of the Commission for the future of the City 
Today we begin in March shut, in June we will have sums. 
This is the calendar of the Campidoglio workers' Commission for the future of the City of Rome, which met this morning in their new location for Caracallským spa. 
In six měsích president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission shall draw up a manual for Rome. 
When in March closed doors, Giunta and municipal council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June to present the strategic plan for Rome with "an official stamp of" Campidoglio and councilor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is fully independent and are included in all political, social and cultural ideas - wants to underline Alemanno - will have to ensure that proposals for the development of Rome, which eventually apply political arbitrators, which remain Giunta and Municipal Board. 
Is not a function of any exchange, but only on the desire to have some place to handle a large project for Rome. 
In March, work will be completed and then dissolve, because this institution must have a precise time limit. 
In June - announces the mayor - as the strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the City of Rome. " 
Those who accuse the Commission of omitting Whereas the polls are not binding, Alemanno odvětí: "Everything depends on the work of the Commission is unable to perform and the quality of their proposals. 
If you are good, as the Commission's proposals Attali, and I am sure that in Rome, its contribution will be crucial. 
Too often policy rozplácne to everyday problems and the urgency of which occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look more and further in-depth perspective, work seriously in the development of Rome and its future. 
In addition to the mayor of Rome, stressed that "the Commission is neither the firm nor unnecessary bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not become either the euro and will serve to popřemýšlení and the involvement of the best intelligence that the capital has." 
For Alemanno, in essence, "you must have a strategic outline as a starting point, not a permanent or stationary in order to allow our city genuine increase in the level of need, united in spirit and thinking of its future.". 
Future, which states the mayor of Rome "is not limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in optics future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital, but "also include the role that Rome can and must carry out as the main Europe and the Mediterranean city. " 
Obama? The first anti-American president. It knows why 
One well-known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent, "Barack Obama will be the second anti-US president." 
The first was Jimmy Carter that his decisions zdecimoval the U.S. economy and maintain relationships (as well today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam ". 
Obamovi attacks against increasing at a time when the approaching date of the elections. 
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition. 
But Obama has the nerve: thinks that reaches to the highest post a nation that had everything every two guvernátory and five black senators. " 
In fact, say many of these attacks "are clearly attacks race, and voters do not answer the question: will be a good president? And then we have the polls, all say that Obama will win as a country mile. 
And in this case, there are those who act in accordance with the heart and not by the brain. 
One newspaper in Mississippi, from the inner parts of the body south of the United States, wrote a comment: once the election kabince know well who gives his voice an American patriot. 
Will be on the surface one page of American mentality, which provides remained until the last minute. 
Call what you want eventually is to care for yourself, who check whether Obama or McCain. " 
There are people who swear: if Obama had won, we went from America. 
These are things that are not yet never expressed , It seems almost certain success of the black candidate. 
However, despite these considerations, the Democrats are the main weapons George Bush. 
1500 people are asked: What mistakes did Bush during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with kopanci in the ass. 
In Iraq zratilo life in 4500 soldiers and the Americans were forced to the collapse. 
And yet he became Iraq for most of Bush's weakness. 
Who will take the place of George W would have done enormous challenges. 
The economic collapse of the U.S. felt the journalists: newspaper is the IP. And many blaming the Internet, "killer" printed. 
PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists on the state of their profession and provided with regard to the future. 
Now today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future. 
However, respondents say openly that they have fewer worries regarding credibility. 
Feel like they used to be isolated. 
The problem for the American journalist money, the money. 
For these journalists is a crisis in 2008 crisis damaged economic model. 
Moreover, the cuts made in the newsroom, in a room where editors are working to put together newspapers, is a huge problem. 
According to respondents journalists this is a problem to be solved if we do not want to be traditional Transport, as it understands the general public, has fundamentally altered. 
U.S. journalist permeates clear, but a comprehensive pessimism. 
Six out of ten journalists, publications and executive seniors are convinced that the novinařina nationally issued the wrong way. 
The local area is a powerful group to 65%. 
Printed against the broadcast. 
For journalists is not difficult to see where he goes web. 
Larger publishers have a way to the Internet, which many see as a "killer" printed. 
"Economic pressure" to the attention of journalists has increased by up to 79%. 
Five hundred of journalists surveyed admitted that they are turning to technology in the hope that their novinařinu "do something good." 
The greatest divide in American journalism is among those who manage newsrooms - that is leading - and reporters who work for them. 
56% of managers at the national level is certain that their reporters share their values, while the local value falls to 23%. 
This is for someone what to do with the "job security". 
Leaders who think that losing a job within three years, is at the national level 47%. 
As regards the journalists, moving to 30%. 
With regard to "some work" on the staff (our editors, NDR) in America is still rampant. 
Only 13% of journalists working on the contract. 
In such a vast nation like the U.S., the three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so is a matter to take or leave. 
Head almost always receive huge salaries and editor can make money even ten thousand U.S. dollars a month off the payment of pensions and insurance. 
As concerns the holiday, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year to achieve the fifteen days after a certain number of years. 
However, American journalists, according to their own confessions, often sick in the course of one year. 
This is just the question of climate change. 
UNIPOL: court in Rome, Danilo COPPOLA remain in GROTTAFERRATĚ 
Second president of the Criminal Chamber of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the filing with the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be able to move from its city, Grottaferraty into an apartment in Rome. 
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the context of counter-offer for the sale of Unipol-BNL. 
During the process at their own expense last week won release from house arrest, which was converted into forced reside in Grottaferratě. 
His lawyers, Michele GENTILONI and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the entrepreneur in real estate could change their place of residence from rural villages to the capital. 
However, according to court this move (against which they expressed pm) he allowed to affect his company and get the evidence to accuse him. 
Elites in danger 
This phenomenon has occurred a few days ago, when the chamber voted against representantů relief plan to provide 700 billion dollars to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans are more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than on saving economy. 
Confirmed yesterday that the New York Times, which informed us that the current crisis rozpolcuje Republican Party ever more divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, friendly federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is the conservative, hostile against "those from Washington 'and to the world of finance, strong particularly in the states in central and southern parts .. 
soul, which is arrogant show the vote, which I have spoken at the beginning .. 
This thing just quoted is not merely an example of the changes, major changes to the current economic earthquakes have shown: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps only here. 
Both the U.S. and in Europe, it appears that the crisis acts as a throttle phenomena that have been incubating in a long time that the new climate utužují and finally come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is reaktualizace, the extraordinary revival of the market, double-category state power in relation to a particular znovuznárodnění economics. 
Depression is indeed a crisis bank financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but which are mainly included in the budgets of the greatest people and families living in one country, in a single State. 
At the same time creating a political problem for those who manage it: it means, how to respond to difficulties and protests by people and families who are, among others, the voters. 
In short, the crisis appears to be the world economically, but politically almost exclusively national. 
Political Transnationality appears to be significantly out of the game and that has nothing much to say: clear evidence gave the European Union, which is divided as ever between the different interests and different national strategies and to be unable to decide on a common policy. 
So everyone waits for action by the government of each country, emergency plans, reviving the market, the new rules, and especially the allocation of funds: when are we going to the emergency, only States have the economic means, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to give everything to OK. 
And also owns the necessary funds and permission, to use two sources of immense value in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will never be able to have a similar extent. 
The new emfáze the crisis poses to the state-national element is in full compliance with the increasing importance that is trying the latest economic developments attributed to one factor closely associated with him: territorial jurisdiction. 
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have entered into the kingdom of the network, more and more sophisticated technology, imateriální, while we were convinced that global finance has been fated to rule the world, nothing from nothing, we realized that our future will have on the other hand, are increasingly confronted with such little matters as nemateriálními water, corn oil. 
All things, who would it be said, can be transported from one place on earth, on the other, but in any case linked, absolutely, to ohraničenému area territory. 
So, who will become their ruler, is certainly much more cards in the sleeve than who he is and who has the misfortune to live on the spot without grain, no oil and no water. 
I get to the second news, but predicts break. 
Who speaks on the territory, the State Government, unavoidably talk about politics, then the leadership. 
In the light of the economic crisis, it appears to be creating two converging phenomena. 
For one awareness that is objectively the need for an authoritative leadership, a request for someone who would be able to seize the situation. 
From the other side wave zdiskreditovanosti against the existing leadership, in particular economic, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places. 
And together something deeper, and a sense disquieting: zdiskreditovanost, impatience, a sense of incompetence and the absence of which it seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries. 
It seems evident that the increasingly expanding population in the broad masách conviction than that their acts the same as the idea has popular elite, as their sense of being and, as their culture in the sense that the elite has overcome its time and care about the views of the majority. 
The requirement to maintain leadership of the underground just one branch, but a strong movement for the abolition of the traditional ruling class and political structure is reflected in the unexpected election "Resistance» or unexpected changes in the collective sentiment on the last and the last time a conservative rise in Austria, Bavaria-to the fall of Labor in Great Britain, the U.S. congressmen to revolt against Bush (and perhaps by doing what is right and victory in Italy). 
We have the impression that the traditional elite, their parties and their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, somebody would say their format are increasingly problem to understand, therefore, represent, which is not from today, creating a deep - layers of western societies, and that once again reinforces the economic crisis, growing to potentially over buffet. 
Before that, it would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent "mass revolt". 
But certainly we can not say that it means to have a big open eyes. 
Super glue on the walls after walking 
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future to go after the walls like Spiderman. 
This is the object of U.S. research centers and now a team of four institutes to him very near. 
Scientists have managed to keep stokilogramové body affixed to the vertical wall using adhesive stamps by only 2.5 centimeters square. 
STUDY - The American journal Science published discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in Akron, Georgijského Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
Material which invented a team of researchers is the development of materials already in place, using a special structure of carbon, which is called dwarf carbon tubes. 
"The basis of glue you can imagine as a series of tubes lying as arranged dollop spaghetti» explained Zhong Lin Wang of Georgijského Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists are inspired by gecko feet, covered by microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion. 
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper showed that the new adhesive is stronger than ten feet of the reptiles and at the same time, "is simply off the wall,» explains Liming Dai, researcher Engineering Faculty University of Dayton. 
Walk in the walls? - "This material could be useful as an adhesive» delivers Liming Dai. 
Perhaps the walking after the walls as Spiderman? Yes, maybe, but researchers think the much less fascinating use as a connection of electric appliances, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could relate to the air space engineering. 
In the meantime, no super heroes. 
FURTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to research new adhesives. 
In one article the magazine American Chemical Society, scientists presented Kalifornští glue formed from micro-fibers such as hair, which they cleaned the dust from moving around, to still maintain a perfect snugness. 
Drugs: never 
juices. Watch the grapefruit, orange and apple juice. 
If you take these beverages that are consumed primarily in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their alcohol consumption by amending gain or reduce the effectiveness and serious damage to health. 
To David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London highlighted the risk of juices as finished, so fresh in combination with the intake of certain medicines to the ongoing 263rd National meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: a single glass grepového, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines to the annulment of their beneficial effects and exposure to patients' health at risk. 
Grapefruit juice has already been charged, that is responsible for that increase to the level of toxic effects of certain antiaritmických drugs, antibiotics, anxiolitik, antihistaminových and neurological drugs. 
MEDICINES IN RISK-announced itself to the Italian medical agency in the newsletter two years ago and vyburcovala doctors and patients to take seriously the danger arising from this Mixed and to give attention to what they drink if they take drugs as an example of diazepam or Methadone. 
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, the orange and apple juice contain substances that rate hampers drugs. 
Utlumených long list of the effects of grapefruit and other juices. 
Then call Micheleho Carruby, director of the pharmacological department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately notify the various international and national agencies lékárnickým, which eventually arrange for exchange of information and instructions drugs. 
So, always read the papers illustrative of medicines that you get and if you encounter something unclear, nezneklidňujte, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification »stressed expert for the Agency ANSA. 
Nobel economist Paul Krugman 
Nobel Prize was awarded American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and location of economic activity. 
Krugman is 55tiletý Novokeňan who teaches at the University of Pricetonu and is known to the editor of The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the most important critics in terms of foreign, economic and political steps the Bush administration. 
Several months after the attacks in September 2001, in the days when krachoval Enron, Krugman said in a commentary published in The New York Times that the second event will be, in terms of impact on the history of the United States, far more important than the first. 
Predicting that raised many controversial and that he has been reading for years, which, however, proved to be accurate. 
"I am surprised and shocked with the speed of breakdowns such as Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public, said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Biniho Lorenzo Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is "an economist of great importance», but also popularizátor who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical against the excesses liberalistické the Bush administration". 
Open Office, we have a third edition package of "anti-Microsoft» 
Is the date of the Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production, leading to the penetration of more and more users from home to office, from the experts on public administration, known as a free alternative to Microsoft Office. 
After about an annual work of voluntary workers, controlled SUN Microsystemem, the new Open Office shows the general public with different news: the welcome screen and the revised and improved otevíracímu window to add another, more importantly, as operating system compatibility for Apple Mac OS X and support for new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version of the ISO standard. 
Emphasis is placed on the cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a new document is a Microsoft (. Docx,. Xlsx,. Pptx). 
Interestingly, the special features of some models as to what allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for the transmission of electronic means, or the ability to transfer PDF component to the model of graphic design and maintain the original look of the page. 
Still of this view can create documents "PDF hybrids, which are similar to the typical format of the Adobe graphics and features a spreadsheet or text program. 
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within the application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together among different users and avoid conflict on the changes in the text of each is assigned a color associates the remarks to a clearer identification of the revision stage. 
Some companies also are working to transfer some functions to Open Office Web site (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should přestavit definitive result. 
Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror from Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system. 
The installation cd can be sent at the request of home or workplace. 
And if the issue can be free to extend the main draw in the home, just in the commercial area of Open Office package a lot of bets, and can no longer count on a variety of projects in public administration and in schools. 
And not even offer training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open a business perspective. 
Open Office is composed of five major models: Writer, for writing video replacing Word, Calc is a spreadsheet program, which aims to offset the Excel, Impress presentation similar Powerpointu, dBase, as in the case slavnějšího Access, is a program that allows work on databases ; Draw, ultimately, is a graphical model. 
The aim for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when you consider that today we have almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of new versions, it is possible that the predicted number can be overcome. 
Kohl also the results are positive, this is the fourth doping case 
New positive case at the last Tour de France: the Rakušana Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified, and the winner of the best T-shirts vrchaře. 
The report quoted the page newspaper L'Equipe. 
26ti year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor to the positive cerium, EPO, third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricci and Leonardo Piepoli and Germans Stefano Schumacher, as well as on the Gerolsteiner. 
The results of blood samples Kohl fall into those that have been made in recent weeks and laboratories Losanna Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the counter-analysis confirms the positive on the cerium, Rakušan lose third place on the Tour and will have to face established two years disqualification. 
Pozitivitě report on Kohl to third-generation EPO confirms the French Anti-Doping Agency chief Pierre Bordry, who told Associated Press that they have been informed of the outcome of the Austrian government authorities. 
Year-old Austrian 26ti be placed on the stage winners for the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and Cadel Evansema American, won the polka-dot shirt best vrchaře. 
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES wonders Italy racists? 
Italy as a country of immigrants only in the last house into a priority objective of immigrants "the resistance. 
Turns to a beautiful country to the nation racists? Well, wonder in a lengthy New York Times article that give this debate on racism in Italy, and began to case the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, was killed last month in Milan, because stealing a box of cookies. 
This case makes what the New York Times define the "paradox of the north": the northern area are also those where it is registered "more integration and more work" but also "the strongest antipřistěhovalecké sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League." 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only that. 
Also, new legislation required Lego, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitating the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy. 
Trends highlighted both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met with Benedetto XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the State and Church worked together to defeat of racism." 
Students victims of expensive leases - to 900 euro per room 
Market hire for university students knows no crisis. 
According to the latest research Shuni, the trade unions for tenants, rent a single room can become a student in Milan to 900 euro in Florence 700, Naples 650, in Rome 600th 
"Jev has reached such proportions that the entire layer of students lost the right to study the overall excessive prices, which their families have suffered - explains the Registrar of the study Shuni, Laura Mariani - in this city high demand on the part of students' marketed in a way zdeformovala That stimulate the process of price increases, which rošířil also residenty. " 
In most cases, offer leases contain several offenses: the contract free manner, non, non capped lease, with associated spare. 
For Sunji should be an exceptional action, which could thanks to a revision of taxes to regulate prices. 
Looking at the details of the research, we see that in Milan, in the Brianza, there is a need for one bed about 450 euros for a single room to the minimum price of 650 (zone Bande NERE) over the mean value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in the zone Vittoria). 
Florence is one bed, on average, 350/400 euro, a room about the 700th 
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near universities, it is necessary to 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 single. 
In Rome university in the central zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) to around 600 euros for single room, 450 bed in a double. 
Values are a little lower (550 euros for single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
Save only if they move to the peripheral regions: 300 euros per bed and 450 for single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like. 
In Naples is a bed should be 300/450 euro, for rooms from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomer and Colli Aminei. 
The Bari want 250/350 euros per bed, at least 350 for single room. 
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but have a greater impact on the economy of citizens. 
In cities such as Perugia, where he is the most common feature of the rent for students from outside the European Union is finally recorded another anomaly: an increase of around 25-30% fee, which they want for foreign students, in comparison with the Italian. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, eliminates the historical city halls 
Historic cinema halls close to the multiplex. 
"City without cinema is like the blind, is a face without eyes." 
Picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore successfully documenting what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in rural villages. 
The process of limiting the cinema, the birth of large, and multisálů in the suburbs following the demise MONOSAL in the central areas of cities, is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime. 
Often disappearing historic places charged memories, "it is as if we lost a friend, the friend with whom we share a long way and a lot of emotion ', felt director of the New Cinema Paradiso, film, which two decades ago Tornatore won an Oscar and a big prize jury in the Cannes, and told of one village cinema poetry and mourning the way of life is about cinema lost forever. 
Values obtained ANEC, the main association of operators speak clearly: in the last five years, close the door 316 cinemas traditional tipu, and the highest paid particular rooms in the main towns: about 10 minutes in Florence, about 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, the 6 less in Torino, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most affected by closure is the first Emilia-Romagna with a loss of 82 kinových halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41). 
A proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, are the three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new kinových multisálů: about 195 canvases more in Lombardy in the past five years, to 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna . 
"The Italian procedure developed weighed» contends Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would need to guarantee that the existing survive because if one theater in town closes, not all of its visitors are willing to relocate to multiplex. 
And not to mention the lack of subsidy to the fund for the benefit of: the national debt is around 10 million. 
In terms of moral and ethical is a shame that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year '. 
Bolognský is an interesting case, the first Italian city, which was responsible for the closure and decided to find a way out by signing protokulu between municipalities and ANEC, the first of this kind in Italy for the protection and promotion of small cinemas in the historic center and in the suburbs. 
The standards are the steps planned tax relief for the benefit of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter into the zone with limited transport and will have special prices to halt and some car parks. 
"This initiative I like» said Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna introducing other measures'. 
It is certain that the order to be able to stand against big power multiplex, the traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding. 
Obramba traditional cinema is a topic that was important for all: the conclusion of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I am already thinking of 10 years. 
I live in Rome, already 25 years old, and when through the already closed Rialto or Quirinale Nazionale in the street, where I shared so many emotions that I did not need to look at the inscriptions black dust, turn around to the other side '. 
The link between politics and mafia groups' ndrangheta, mayor of Gioia Tauro in prison 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the elections according to the Office of the City of mafia groups Piromalli." 
Allegations that the Directorate against the mafia in Calabria raise against the mayor and vicestarostovi Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavoni, and the mayor Rosarna Carlo Martellimu, imprisoned this morning due to external collaboration with the mafia organization, are heavy. 
In želízkách also Gioacchino Piromalli, a mediator between the old clan and public administration, and his lawyer son, namesake chief, has accused of committing crimes mafiánského character, person to be paid 10 million euros. 
"Ignoring all the legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," wrote prosecutors, when two local administration has expressed its willingness to pay a lawyer Piromallimu consultations. 
"This would enable the mafia group - write the judges - officially enter the municipal offices and facilitate the already huge possibilities for the control and management of public administration." 
President of the regional Commission kalábrijské Agazio LOIERO does not hide that secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal podsvětím in the region a lot: "There are areas in which the concentration of mafia stronger than in the other, where the secret agreement inevitable. 
But we also have many local politicians who resist nátlakům 'ndranghety, heroes, who are still virgin. " 
Incarceration of this morning following the imprisonment in July last year, the police showed that the mafia group Piromalli got the final shot. 
Since the end of April last year - Gioia Tauro city council was dissolved since 1991, ground was then projected the links between organized crime and local government - local politicians have been deprived of the functions of the municipal administration. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who at the time of dissolution was elected head of a coalition of center right after the close election in May. 
Cried the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the Municipal Council. 
He called for responsibility to the then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minnitiho and accused him that everything zosnoval for political reasons, but judges in the regulation of imprisonment signed this morning explaining that the mafia group reached even so far as to ask for a change of highway A3. 
For further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrionovi, write public applicants, have revealed the "willingness to move the business demands, a representative of a larger group of very close, as is generally known Piromallimu and adapt elections government interests mafia groups.". 
When the energy emerges from the waves, you enter the big game. 
This is endless deposit, which covers more than 70% of the earth's surface, and it is now emerging major global energy companies. 
Waves, currents, inflows, outflows are new sources of inexhaustible energy, which adhering vision Giants such as Chevron, which of these resources is now trying his hand extended. 
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea is studied for more than a century and the 70th years in connection with the first oil crisis, the research intensified. 
When around 1980 the price of oil dropped, the idea of the exploitation of marine energy to go party. But now environmental organizations and a new rise in oil prices gave the sector a new impulse. 
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 said that about 15 percent of global electricity consumption could be covered through the movement of sea waves. 
This would be twice the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear centers. 
In addition, there are currents and tide. 
Giants attacks. 
company that has embraced sea power, the Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build facilities in the north of Portugal. 
When it was announced this intention, looked to the huge revolutionary step. 
After two years as betting on marine energy, is more and more companies, as betting on sea power rather than on traditional energy. 
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - expressed the spokesman of one company, which is connected to the oil colossus the United States, the economic daily newspaper Wall Street Journal - and think about the possibility to cooperate with us." 
Cooperation, which we're looking at, relates to obtaining a permit from the U.S. Commission on Energy, which is needed to run the project on the use of marine energy in Alaska. 
This signal can not underestimate, especially when taking into account that in Alaska also benefit U.S. oil and President Bush recently came up with a plan for the new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron monitor the track of marine energy and verdant Power Inc.. From New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey and has invested sum, although details are not known, according to observers indicate growing interest. 
Technology, kerou there is a need to develop. 
Experts talk about technology, which is still in prvopočátcích because they know the impact of marine energy on the environment. 
In the meantime, establishments in Portugal and one in Scotland are small dimensions and appears to be causing major problems for the ecosystem. 
For more energy production is necessary to use the technology with a greater impact on the Environment. 
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected with each other. 
The strength of the waves, which varies with the buoys up and down, it changed with the help of rollers and cylinders of hydraulic pressure within the s afraid. 
Roztáčí pressure turbine, which supplies power to the generator. 
Energy reaches shore submarine cables. 
In the meantime, they are at the stage of four projects of this type of facility, which just waiting for federal approval of a portion of the energy could be used for military purposes. 
On the other hand, verdant Power already produces energy for the shopping center parking lot and the use of six pdmořských turbines in newyorském East River. 
The movement of water over in the tide turn causes a turbine, which in this revolving movement of live generator. 
Verdant opined that they have a long list of clients who are awaiting authorization necessary because of the possibility of using this energy. 
After the waves, after the inflow and outflow for. 
Special interest you in this moment deserves potential in the tide, say the Institute for Research of electricity. 
Although the abrupt factor inflows and outflows are more predictable than wind, sun and waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy. 
Into energy in the tide states as New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states have already invested 7 and a half milinonu dollars in 2008 and predicted investment to 35 million dollars for 2009.
