Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the proposed cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the opposition leader.
MEPs rejected at second reading the proposed amendment to reduce sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former First Minister is currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko in October was sentenced to 7 years in prison for entering into an agreement with Russia priori disadvantageous for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko describes the judgment of political revenge of the regime and led a process of suspected partiality of the court also to the west.
Cancel the proposed paragraph 365 of the criminal law, based on which the former Minister premere was sentenced, was signed by 147 MPs.
There have been 226 votes for approval.
Libyan victory
Liberation or rebellion Jamahiriya already defeated her.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals.
The Interim National Council declared the usual Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without crime because for a flight is cut by hand.
Women can forget emancipation, not respect any of the faith is punishable by death ...
This is the Quran that will unite instead of the personality of the dictator society composed of opposing tribes.
Libya will rule such an order as we can not represent us and as we would certainly not do.
But the way we live is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist fighters have agreed to help with recognition of infidels dogs.
The only excuse is that this is not a general américian who led the NATO strikes but Allah which they celebrated the greatness in each attack.
So when it comes to look for winners in Libya, the West does not belong
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitiques turned away from the dictator as an ally without this policy brings no profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not deal militarily Libya.
There is therefore no problem for locals to get rid of &quot;crusaders&quot;.
Do not land, oil companies have easy access to black gold libyien.
Maybe not as much and the West will eventually boast a disinterested protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these followers of the sharia.

Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
Several hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this move by the nuclear program of their country against a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities of Isfahan have created a human shield around Tuesday&#39;s Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center which is processed uranium.
They expressed openly that they would defend the program NUCLEAR their country risking their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, which would aim to destroy Iran&#39;s nuclear program, the targets would not only Isfahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an overweight child: do not take breakfast and not take cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have weight problems, 9% of écoliersont weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As shown in current research obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the environment in which a human being and patterns that surround it.
On the tables of obese children are for instance 50% of meat more often than in families of children at normal weight.
19% of obese had fries for dinner according to a survey conducted with advocacy &quot;Obesity is not a chance&quot;
In large families of small sport is also not a habit, what is now the case of most students today - only 15% responded at least once a week were the parents time for active movement.
Investigation of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 primary school children in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, action supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
Since the beginning it was more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who enrolled in the project.
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children overweight or obese, is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
&quot;Only half the children surveyed said such as eating five times a day if breakfast - lunch - dinner snack, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition,&quot; said one of the results of investigation.
Without breakfast and dinner sausages
Experts point to the fact that for a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
Czech Republic, only 23% of students&#39; families to eat my same hours.
In most families everyone has breakfast only.
And the worst that has been identified is one tenth of the population does not at all breakfast.
Breakfast is nevertheless the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children are consumed more often unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinking soft drinks daily (70%).
Over 40% of children surveyed regularly plays sport but for parents it&#39;s half, only 15%.
Get ready your diet
Another part of the investigation led to the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) prepare its own food from opportunities offered by their own taste and personal opinion.
&quot;The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far, in terms of healthy eating, the ideal&quot;.
Among their favorite dishes there are plenty of cakes, meats and sweets.
&quot;Most alarming is a particularly strong preference for sweet lemonade,&quot; is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch it&#39;s the pasta that took place just before the first white meat.
Children do not want starch and the preference for fish meal and vegetables was very low.
Cap on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
&quot;In a control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the educational session&quot; Obesity is not a chance &quot;, was present at the taking a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet, &quot;indicate the results of the investigation.
The most striking example was in respect of sugary soft drinks as children began to give preference to water consumption.
Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main course and sweet dishes and reduce the &quot;dumplings&quot; (spécialté Czech dumplings flour bread or potatoes).
The designer must also be a good psychologist, professionals say
In an introductory article on how to learn for designers, I started a little bit angry because there were many from the start.
I was not thinking about what would happen next.
Presentations from three professional specialty, clothing and characters of a seminar on what happens there.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it&#39;s truly &quot;drunk&quot;.
This time we have with the Director Alenka (over there is no boy) addressed how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy&#39;s body, without particular curve, another overweight.
The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend or add a neck curves necessary.
We arrived pretty well to emphasize the character and also not to dress too flashy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with large breasts and hips and a pronounced waist.
If there is such a difference between the waist and hips so that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it&#39;s worth it to have it done custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls neatly is invaluable.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than the one that glides continuously, wraps and not due to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a dress style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I&#39;m glad I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I also fear that, given what I do at home is there too.
Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, mode type of personality and appearance.
I will &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know of the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaign.
In my heart, I am pleased because it&#39;s better than to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, which took almost one hundred pounds lately (do not take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or searching the Internet, print and graphic design work.
The Moodboard, as they say in the final result, express our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
Reflect also on the graphics portion of styling is also important.
The stylist did not dress so only the physical but creates productive eg pages in magazines (on specific products trends for handbags, coats, etc ...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and designer, has maintained all this.
But that ... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three of the guests gave a specialty diversified aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka Renc and Ben, a fashion photographer.
Jakub has reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one dress differently.
Variability is important for this example.
Such as the trench coat that must be worn with classic jeans and a t-shirt as a light jacket but it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take a picture as a dress .
Or just holding sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
&quot;Play with this,&quot; he said.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: &quot;To work you need to know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;You can then begin to infringe,&quot; said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines you sometimes see something else.
No statement on the catwalk.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the designer must be many more variations of clothing than those photographed.
This means that for fashion story to be about ten pages (thus ten models) I must be prepared to &quot;shrink&quot; at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently in reality.
We must reckon with it during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but his image and marketing have made a global star.
Czech Republic, the approach to the use of services of stylists still chilly.
And the familiar faces sometimes regard as useless (just something I know but what I seem to pass in the second row).
And if someone gets a styling make our part, we must then rely on the fact that he tells us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than it actually has.
It remains then only surf google and check if the details show boulevard of the celebrity in question, if she lost weight and grown so ...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough to move into designer fashion and how to assemble models.
It must communicate with people he dresses well and is important to be a good psychologist.
Guess people know, not to flatter, keep his opinion.
&quot;When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new items you can not throw everything away and say, My God, how awful.&quot;
&quot;There are few things that you find attractive and that you will advise him what to wear them with,&quot; says Mario.
This showed us concretely what must all contain the so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or sack the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and so on you for everything you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, rollers for hair removal or even safety pins, there are also nylon thread (the stylist uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), clips special with a garment which is closed in the back, if too large (the pin or other type of clip are not utlisables because they may damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
For that we be not only people who listen but have tried something practical way they taught us how to properly ressemeller shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the base could damage, let alone outdoors.
And so we stuck and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors to avoid injury by accident.
Therefore real skills.
Mario I was pleased when he congratulated me for my creation.
The comptence which I discuss is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend courses
I began increasingly to understand that make styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone may say what he wants.
Need for Speed ​​The Run is played all over America.
Revision
Originally a race without problem becomes because of a series of stupid mistakes of people who do not belong in a routine morning shift at work.
It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new game, subtitled The Run has produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the racing series Need for Speed ​​already old and out like a game playable from parts that do not just count points.
We were curious how the passages will be added in which the hero leaves his car and does what he wants.
As is already in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what we atttendait.
These are potentially racing games arcades all but pulls down because of some unnecessary fouls that already exist for several years.
These are not really errors but rather an expression of the incomprehensible laziness from developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in an adventure whose hero Jack has behavior problems and to resolve begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to finish first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then over 50 races.
This means that every race is on a different route and stages set in different environments that stand well enough from each other and are interesting.
The player did not feel a moment that the game itself offers something similar.
Some environments are further quite nice although the level graphical technique is the same type as the previous series.
Finally it is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert landscape in autumn or in the snowy mountains is very highly visually pleasing.
The tests are in addition to occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you greatly reduces visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Beside that the different races are arranged one behind the other.
There &#39;are only a small number but it was enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then you still waiting for another duel with an opponent.
Occasionally you also have police coming into the game and trying to get the dificult situation.
The new crossings are outside the vehicle.
It is rather una interactive animation when most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you must help by pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments like this that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is as good as this component will not interfere and is placed in the context described above, in the elements dress up game
The model of action is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that currently there is nothing fancy but you can not say that it is negative.
With regard to the realistic simulation you will go elsewhere.
But although we can find better in conccurrence leadership style goes very well with the type design racing.
So everything is ok.
The problems start to appear after some time.
At the diffference Model of Conduct, that collision is not yet ready.
We do not expect this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not, in a collision with any object, any idea of ​​how your car behaves, in proceedings is not completely correct.
During the tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other but slightly different from your self in crazy acrobatics.
Or is found to smithereens.
Thanks to restart this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done so that when you&#39;re broke or you figure out the game in the set you back at the last point on the route.
But you do just that 5 restarts.
When you used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the start.
So it&#39;s more a tool, in case something does not happen as it should, that something that you can truly count on.
Sometimes reboots do not help and we must find the solution to the piece of memory remémorrant route in question.
The great catch of this game is that the same actions can be found in the same places.
For example there are some corners that we should move a certain way if it does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter on a given location of vehicles &quot;civilian&quot; always in the same configuration as you reach the first, fifth, five seconds ahead or one minute late.
What angers these are the situations when you see the opponent switch easily between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and conturner or slow.
Never mind if you go to meet him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; so that for the given situation always happens near your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the time of the game, but you have come in some places, again regardless of the time, and you still have the same opponent in front of you in one place.
This causes the most problems in end-game as you travel on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs before you go.
When it passes you it blocks the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide many times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you&#39;re bored quickly.
And it&#39;s a shame because through a simple model of driving the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
And no matter if it&#39;s because the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of races is such that n &#39;there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change in car races.
You must be careful at petrol stations on the routes because you can change cars, however most of the time that you simply.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big cars to U.S. highways straight and super sports cars with exotic finery on very technical lines such as on winding roads in the mountains.
And mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of the adventure, goes very well with the primary plan of history.
You receive not only medals but experience points that add to your profile which is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest level of driver, objects begin to unlock:
It connects with the on-line function Autolog which include comparing your results with other players and give you other functions in the community.
One of the hardest blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You come with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you ride in the dark on the way (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (in advance) and you happen behind a subway train that sends you directly to the car for scrap.
In writing we had a discussion a few days to see if anyone has really thought of when creating this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not great, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What bothers is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging does not serve you any more.
The audio portion is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and most especially to young audiences a new soundtrack was created in the style &quot;I mix everything&quot;, but we can expect that no one will buy the game for music .
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game did not have those stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared that the mistakes you type in the eyes with the force of a reflector aerodrome.

Vicenova, Ambassador by the EU standards:
Czechs behave as negativistic and Eurosceptics
&quot;The Lisbon Treaty has fundamentally eliminated the balance between institutions&#39;
&quot;I do not expect a war so hard.&quot;
&quot;This will last 5.6 years before the situation calmed down and all players get used to their new role&quot;, that is how Milena Vicenova began his presentation to the Faculty of Law Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the different EU bodies and their relationships so if understandable and visible, to the point that many speakers of the Law Faculty of Charles University might envy, she showed how it takes its motto &quot;understandable and openly about Europe&quot; very seriously.
Ms Vicenova has praised the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new President of the European Council.
&quot;From the beginning echoed the criticism he is bland, it&#39;s a pencil pusher, he can no rempplir mission and I must say it was breathtaking to everyone because it takes his role to perfection. &quot;
&quot;He&#39;s a good listener 27 member states, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where to go to Europe.&quot;
She explained the new position of High Representative for Foreign and defense policy as part of an answer to the question: &quot;Who&#39;s who in the European Union?&quot; &quot;At what phone number do I call?&quot;, Therefore as an important step towards greater unity and clarity of the Union policy dealing with states, as is China or India.
Nobody wants to deny us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Ms Vicenova reported also on the agenda has lived, lives and will live in a time close to the European Council.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago of success.
The Czechs have solved the burgeoning financial crisis, gas crisis, or have held a Summit for Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of very negative for the Government and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation to the EU is currently busy.
In the words of Madam Ambassador, &quot;the activity was in full swing&quot; not only for the Presidency but also to the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
There must also approve the new budget septimal Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, at least, everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels &quot;Keep Europe understandable&quot;.
&quot;I really do not like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no making pickles round or twisted, or large bananas differently although we were not forbidden to syrecky &quot;.
She wants to make better use of EU environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe ahead
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being skeptics and people who see things only in their more negative than positive.
In addition she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in European institutions.
The fault results, she said, several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter and a little support from the Czech side.
Also a Czech Presidency to success she went on to emphasize the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group.
&quot;Believe me, when I come to Polish, Magyar, Slovak, the French said, &#39;Hey, you do qu&#39;estce there, done that again this Visegrad?&quot; And it is not at all happy &quot;.
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future are new tough rules on fiscal policy that await members.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not multi-speed, rather than prevailing &quot;new European federation&quot;.
&quot;We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area, we also institute enhanced cooperation&quot;.
First it was said that cooperate with each country who want and those who do not wish to sit in a corner. &quot;
&quot;There will be many such institutes and there will be a two-speed Europe really,&quot; Ms Vicenova expected.
From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye determine the basis by which all issues affecting the EU should be discussed among all members of the EU and not just memebres of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to get the word that expresses the closer the IBM, the closest would be &quot;long term&quot;.
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is seen as a firm and yet very current since its inception it took one hundred years.
Based on this long-term strategy has been thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that many global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
Her motto, &quot;THINK,&quot; became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of IBM internal magazine that began to publish in 1935).
This was the basis of corporate culture soignement developed by Watson.
IBM means for us a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived one hundred years due to the fact that she always remained true to its core values ​​and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around her.
This allowed us during our first century of transforming technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more &quot;for the anniversary has délaré the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared
Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only American among the first employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer a more uniform employee an elegant and well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmerciaux.
Similarly IBM has a sytème of customer relations well developed.
The company was early in the discovery of great talents-as one of the first companies to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could well have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory, since it will be a woman-Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
This works for IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brainstorming online from what comes from many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company that provide a safe position in the fields of business.
&quot;Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather than an institution of technology firm,&quot; said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of IBM.
&quot;IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve problems in the world of business by using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm.
As stated by the firm itself there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.
IBM - or the &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as it is familiarly called in the U.S. with regard to its slogan, in a hundred years it has grown into one of the largest global companies.
This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, housing, services at the Council&#39;s server products, to nanotechnology.
It has many patents of all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries ranks such as ATM, card payment, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM found itself this year with $ 220 billion the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Overview ahead
Not all fabrications and innovations that have taken customer preference and the time - for example, IBM has not met the challenge of a clean operating system OS / 2, the Prodigy online service or the &#39;IBM PCjr:
&quot;From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you can not remain emotionally attached to the past,&quot; notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
Why IBM has no problem to build bases on many platforms and when they do not work she goes.
Unlike the example of Microsoft conccurent that stands at the base and remains under the operational system Windows.
A technology perspective
IBM in revenue, services, who are trained to fifth by the software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However even in 1990 it was with more than one half the participation of the strongest representative hardware.
Starting in 2000 IBM sold the low-yielding assets for $ 15 billion during grasp this period it has invested $ 58 billion in purchasing technology perspectives.
She goes on investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression has also increased its investment volume.
It now appears that IBM passes the current crisis without interference?
The share price has progessé IBM from 2008 rocket 120 percent, net income from the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the company IBM is to change everything but not its values.
Can be expected for this that this giant flexible mastery of other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to the flights in the cosmos.
The IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago, it was initially the name Computing Tabulating Recording complicated Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to 80 years of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old &quot;clocks&quot;, clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Ranlett Charles Flint until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.

Watson was so invaluable to the firm after 40 years steering his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s people and computers from IBM helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - Mercury, Saturn in 1969 and the flight to the moon.
Meanwhile in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The PC classic that determined the standard of computer time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, but the company bought PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting and began to care and counseling services with high added value.
The IBM strategy that succeeds in the last three years - is the concept Smarter Planet &quot;Smarter Planet&quot;.
Its goal is the intelligent technology Usage requirements in areas not yet exploited, such as transportation and city management.
Regarding the area of ​​trade IBM has developed there is little time platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; which helps sales manager at the business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our area.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.

The worst vices of women: It concerns you too?
If you ask the men to determine defects typical of women, all, some like the others, are able to get out &quot;of their race.&quot;
My dear ladies, you&#39;ll experience in the following lines of female vices coming to pump blood from the veins of men.
Purchases
Your half you commented that you are dependent on purchases?
You must buy at least one garment per week?
You are happy to buy and packet during the sales?
In your case we can speak of purchases as a flaw.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist window shopping in clothing stores, looking for himself in pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideally of different colors)?
And although for most women buy either a hobby, it can become for man a living hell.
Just remember how many times have you told your spouse that he expects the entry ...
Continuing dissatisfaction
&quot;I&#39;m not too big&quot;?
&quot;I need to lose weight under 5 pounds - I should start exercising?&quot;
&quot;You like me?&quot;
These sentences do not they remind you something?
Yes?
Therefore you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop looking after yourself but many people are allergic to the fact that their partner is always going to complain about its appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the higher the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become pesky.
The cleanliness cleanly in the first place
It&#39;s like a carousel infinity.
Washing windows, vacuuming, washing floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and that twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the floor clean, the children they have messed up the sink, dirty the glass in the living room, and this gives you a lot of work?
In case you have precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness should not be in first place in the family.
This desire for cleanliness harmless but can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The undermining
&quot;Met this tracksuit worn in the trash.&quot;
&quot;You look to those old socks again tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;A wet towel does not belong on the floor&quot;.
If you make your partner this undermining in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
Obviously you do not think badly you want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men did, women would not do so much work to undermine ...
Defamation, mockery
Defamation, mockery but also insults against someone are also characteristic of some women.
Women tend particularly to relationships and so are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us let out a little harmless banter here and there.
Hand on heart yet it is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent even despise others and for those around them are - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Voracek and Jagr helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr participated twice in the victory over Philadelphia Monday&#39;s game on NHL ice Carolina and is again at the top of Czech players productive for the contest.
From the perspective of 39 years of star Claude Giroux, who still makes a pass over and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr has also recorded two goals in the match.
Jagr after the game told reporters from across the Atlantic that Giroux had warned it would be a great evening.
&quot;I told him before the game he would give his hat-trick&quot;.
&quot;I felt it.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes it falls on you feeling&quot; Jagr said after his action Giroux scored a goal in the Flyers&#39; first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals for the Hurricanes to the puck and presented it to the scorer Max Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer raided, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I do not mean he is the best player in the league but it really is part of the top three,&quot; said Jagr about its center.
&quot;I never thought I&#39;d play late career with a hokeyjiste like him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m really happy about that.&quot;
&quot;I want to play on him.&quot;
&quot;All these years the other NHL players on the team tried to play me, now it&#39;s my turn,&quot; said Jagr.
Caroline did a drama of this match with a goal because of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shot ends it with a one goal difference.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended two against one.
&quot;Pronger has carried out attacks in our area excellent&quot;.
&quot;He tapped the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
&quot;I tried to hit him and I got there,&quot; describes the last goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came up with the win ahead of the Eastern Conference.
Czech defenseman Jaroslav Spacek in Montreal did not finish the game with Buffalo he came in second to third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candiens have failed to meet an experienced defender ahead of their two butset lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick that especially bothered the coach rather than local Poins lost because they played the game with only five defenders.
&quot;This sucks&quot;.
&quot;We played the game with only an experienced player, the rest were young.&quot;
&quot;But we don &#39;need to do anything, it&#39;s like this,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Replacement of replacing it was not enough and we were not able to resist.&quot;
&quot;We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area.&quot;
For this we had limits, &quot;said one of the defenders PK Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defenseman took part in the attack thirtieth of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who issued a series of five games lost.
How did the price of travel since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five in Czechoslovakia travel agents state: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time were offering trips especially in the socialist bloc countries, because travel to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, the Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
One important exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination to the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era that was not authorized nétait for citizens of the socialist bloc (including for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even in socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union he had an invitation letter if not the individual journey was not allowed.
Travel agencies also offered at the time of travel to the West, however, he had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency which was the condition to travel to the west was denied to people &quot;politically incorrect&quot; who could not travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency was not, however, exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain funds without the approval of foreign exchange (currency west) to travel to the west.
Czechs spent their holidays mostly in countries where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs are buying and this habit continues until now.
Travel Czechs have been known since 1989 a great revolution.
Although the holiday until 1989 in East Germany and Bulgaria were up, Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we do not realize today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of last century in the neighboring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short visits especially in Austria and Germany in Vienna.
The Czechs could not travel by air for a long time in the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
Such organizations in Paris Travel Czechs were sleeping in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or pension.
The typical characteristic of a journey of Czechs was at that time to carry with it its own canned food, sausage, etc. ... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which has allowed our tourists after last decades can freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average wages increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
With a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with links through which air charter contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what there was before.
In the late 90s of last century the Czechs had connections with virtually no visas most developed countries around the world apart from the EU which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism post-revolution, was prepared when the first charter air travel to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year of direct air charter emmènent of Czech tourists in the distant warm climates this winter there will be 12 exotic locations from the Czech Republic.
It&#39;s more than 100,000 Czechs visiting exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution happened in 2008.
November 17, 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and has allowed our country to settle down completely in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history still spent more than 15 000 kroons per person for holidays abroad including ancillary costs. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with an unresolved situation &quot;stalemate&quot;
Nearly 5 months already without football Czech President and risk the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known even after a General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk .
However there is still no agreement to vote according to what rule should be performed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure has called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the chambers of the Association who are unable to agree on a common candidate.
This is completely shown on Sept. 16 when they had to choose a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in the National House unnecessarily in Prague since the negotiation is stuck and it was not even address the question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on the fact of who is entitled to vote at the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or officials also invested with full powers.
In this one point there was a partial agreement since that time also with the help of the Office for the state and law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences still remain about the regulation for the election.
It is obvious that the executive committee, which in its negotiations planned or extraordinary, does not bring anything to the situation
The views on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same.
The question is how the third round to avoid falling in the pat.
&quot;The bone of contention is the fact: either proceed under the statutes or find another model,&quot; noted one of three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model provided in the third round wins the candidate who receives the most votes as a percentage in the House for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is told to withdraw that wins the candidate receiving the largest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech part examines the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentage of votes.
&quot;Only then it would lose the idea of ​​two previous rounds and that would completely reject the concept bicameral&quot; admits Svoboda including objections from the Moravian part and in which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes into force.
It is surprising that Tomas is also Paclik agree even if it considers that the regulation of elections established by the statutes as Pelta advantage among all candidates.
&quot;I hope we vote up according to the statutes of the association&quot;.
&quot;For there is still no crazy ideas dreamed up by a representative as during the past General Assemblies,&quot; said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time in his presentations and has defined primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
&quot;The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone.&quot;
&quot;Football is back on a wave of happiness and there aure more enthusiasm for cooperation,&quot; added the officer who Jablonec among the three has the most experience in leadership as a professional football at the level Regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
&quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the rules to drawing.&quot;
&quot;This can cause a blockage again at the General Assembly&quot;.
&quot;I still hope that good will win because&quot; Rajchl said.
There is not much time to a common agreement for all parties.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight which had to travel up Podgorice including the Vice-Presidents and Dalibor Rajchl Kucera, did not take off for technical reasons and they sought a variation to take part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be delighted to receive the torn in the sports association of the largest countries and lead to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state grant, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports should determine the direction of the sport after Czech Sazka&#39;s financial problems.
Paclik goes into battle for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of footballers Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not put campaigning for this high office.
&quot;If there is such a candidate I support, I fight for him and I&#39;m not running for election.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,&quot; said Paclik the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl precisely to try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which a priori would be favored to the election.
Paclik also emphasizes that if he would win the election that he would only serve as President until 2013 year provided for a General Assembly.
It would function well in an experienced manager and high level but that is not associated with football.
&quot;I talked to people who have the profile,&quot; he said.
&quot;For me it was terrible when some told me they did not want to be identified with the Czech football right now.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that image,&quot; he added.
Which, they say, especially Paclik discomfort, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union Soccer Roman Berbr Plzen, controversial man to fame is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing on the vote of the delegates&#39; the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable Pelta occupies this position of President.
&quot;If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot;
&quot;And with the support of Berbr, which is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable to the football,&quot; proclaimed Paclik.
What shocked him still is the fact that the name was pronounced Pelta few years ago during tapping as part of an investigation into a corruption case, why Pelta escaped without any sentence.
&quot;I do not know what prestige Pelta bring football.&quot;
&quot;And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club Plzen.&quot;
In case Paclik triumph in Thursday&#39;s vote, he must prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, which had ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go.&quot;
&quot;It has great capabilities&quot;
&quot;It would be able to stand such as the head of the representation.&quot;
&quot;But as manager of the Association would not be able.&quot;
&quot;I do not put your nose in what I do not know&quot;, which indicates Paclik in September has attracted great attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Referees Committee, now replaced with Ludek Macela Dagmar Damkova .
Paclik says he would be in to head the Association.
It takes as an example of her leadership abilities and private firms that also runs since last year the club Plzen who celebrated with his support last May&#39;s triumph in the first division.
&quot;I have the strength to change something in the sports world and to make a certain culture.&quot;
&quot;I freinerais the influence of certain interest groups that have such a tendency to influence the Disciplinary Committee and Appeals, which leads to situations of bad taste,&quot; added Paclik Chache who expressed opposition to the Head of Daniel Kretinsky Sparta.
It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with the high level policy would provide for sport more tax money on games.
&quot;This is one of the key issues that the new President should address.&quot;
&quot;If this is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,&quot; he said.
Paclik does not take its current binding with the club Plzen as something negative even if he himself says that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above parties&quot;.
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
&quot;This is not the ideal.&quot;
I see no reason to pass on my club shares Plzen someone if I were to return after a year and a half, &quot;said Paclik.
Pelta promised a new constitution for the AFRT that should end the stalemate situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, will AFRT the new statutes which should put an end to squabbles in the future about Regulation for the elections.
The official Jablonec is before Thursday&#39;s meeting in Nymburk very optimistic that today the success of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that has not made promises just to focus on national representation and obtaining funding if elected.
He decided to run for the last time just before the General Assembly passed and the two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of the direction of football and to present it in a broad context.
&quot;People at all levels of football have long been waiting for Thursday and there is a President&quot;.
&quot;They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association&quot;, he adds, but it is primarily associated with the club Jablonec, worked many years Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in lépoque Ivan Hasek.
&quot;Unfortunately the&quot; General Assembly in June of statutes were approved that were not perfect, as they all have noticed. &quot;
&quot;If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a president since September,&quot; said Pelta.
This is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the attention of delegates.
&quot;If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in case it does not work&quot;.
&quot;It is a principle without which we can not exist,&quot; Pelta said.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He said previously that it can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl recognizes that in view of his legal training and he knows that his opponent would be his first nominee, Vice President.
He did not have long attacked the contrary Tonas Paclik that does not stop criticizing Pelta.
&quot;He has been in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot;
&quot;His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.&quot;
&quot;This is also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; said Pelta at his opponent but still, he says, true to the claims he made in September.
His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a vitirne football.
&quot;And also I would try to complete all cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or following the corruption scandal.&quot;
&quot;I would enter immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so we can get enough money for all the soccer,&quot; he told the Czech News Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of persons.
&quot;I should get to know all the employees,&quot; he said at Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios provided with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
&quot;If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we get to surpass him.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility and it will not get that when there will be headed by a new leader&quot;, as stated optimistically Pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his public service career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT begin working hard
&quot;If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the&quot; General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and the Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the case Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football bring more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As President I want to take care of football as a whole&quot;.
&quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and a successful youth football.&quot;
&quot;But I&#39;m not saying I will do this alone&quot; Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
&quot;I am a team player and want to distribute expertise within the Executive Committee so that each member is responsible for a specific area.&quot;
&quot;And I will distribute to difficult missions that football face a major step forward&quot;.
&quot;Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticizing others,&quot; he added.
He reported, it is said, he would not stand as a candidate because of critical atmosphere.
&quot;About me, you know that I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know if it&#39;s worth it and if I have people behind me who will always spoke in the wheels and emit doubts about each of my actions,&quot; explaining why he hesitated.
&quot;Many people I have still said that I must not give up because they give up too.&quot;
&quot;Its a confidence that I can not betray,&quot; he said.
What motivates him, they say, is to continue the work begun with Hasek.
&quot;Since these last two years there has been a great work done and I do not want to drop it.&quot;
&quot;There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not want someone stops them. &#39;, He said with concern that in the case of election of the Miroslav Pelta situation within the Union back to its pre Hasek.
&quot;I believe in a systematic and it is something that Mirek Pelta can not do.&quot;
&quot;Behind him are people who fairaient football so it would be only for those who have been chosen.&quot;
&quot;You can blame me for a number of things but certainly not to support Would somebody&quot;.
&quot;I try to be objective&quot;.
&quot;I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not just those who were chosen
And it confirms again that it would be only one President for the Czech Republic.
&quot;And if any who say otherwise, I am ready to do their utmost to Moravia&quot;.
&quot;For example, it is time to consider the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and one Moravian whose winners would meet in the first division.&quot;
&quot;There would be no situation as at present with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem now is to find young players.
As Paclik Tomas, president of the Club of Plzen, has entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl can not assess his own chances of winning.
&quot;I feel ongoing support of the Czech Chamber who elected me as its Vice President and know that with me there will be success,&quot; said Rajchl which envisages among its future success can save tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, contract negotiations with the television and the Gaming Act.
He says instead that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault at all.
As he said about Pelta &quot;he is disqualified because it lets the Czech footblal lose credibility,&quot; he thinks the second Paclik opponent is a strong candidate that has something to offer football.
&quot;No one can doubt that in Plzen has made this year a great job.&quot;
&quot;If elected he would continue in what surely was started by Hasek and would not change significantly among persons in the Committees.&quot;
&quot;He would not want to spoil its success,&quot; said Rajchl who valued its rivals.
The best pools of Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
Wading in optical UFO, gorgeous pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the town or a long walk-can rest his tired legs in the bathroom of sparkling water .
A book shows what swimming pond can experience the most welfare.
When Iris Meder went on a journey of research during the last 18 months, there is an object that should not fail in his luggage: a swimsuit.
Lying on his back in the water, she watched the cupolas artistically arranged, and swam against the marble Putten, who was waiting on the other side of the pool and never failed to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau converted these pools.
If a restaurant gave him pleasure, she noted in her book without delay all the interesting details on the type of construction and the building&#39;s history.
More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by historian Meder architecture and presented them in his book already published: &quot;Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath.&quot; The municipal indoor swimming pools in Munich, the palaces of historic Bath Black Forest, &quot;Hardcore concrete buildings&quot; in the Taunus.
It led his &quot;trips to the bathroom most outstanding of Central Europe&quot; in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Germany&#39;s 46 years is a real earnest the bathroom culture.
Meder, explained that she did not have much interest in sport but ell is attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that the supporters of swimming must be content to contemplate the blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the intoxicating perfume of spruce forests or can listen to the chirping Bird Park merry.
&quot;I wondered one day why the pools are in fact always be so ugly,&quot; said the Viennese.
&quot;So I started a collection of fine bathroom.&quot;
The water surface reinforces doubling architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of well-being in the halls of swimming are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more trouble, the rooms could be swimming a delight for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor was a water surface in swimming halls.&quot;
&quot;It is a transparent side, but reflects on the other hand, however, the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
All surfaces appear optically a double way: high arches, colorful tiles, stepping stones.
The image volume small format &quot;Badefreuden&quot; is a noteworthy report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture of the oasis of wellness history - it gives certainly want to take a leap into blue.
The collector Meder discovered copies remarkable during his research in Hungary.
Besides the baths welfare splendid as the Széchenyi Bath 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a spa bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building shaped bottle.
By cons, heated pools outdoor Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a roof bath Zürich was the city in his eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snow from a restaurant in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which one can view the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the design of the most extraordinary pool awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aqua Dome looks like a UFO that has landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from three open shelves, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal skyward.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all pools in the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, Árpád-spa in Miskolc Hungary emanates a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbon which is almost black and its mud sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During his search of beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, an outdoor pool and free outdoor Czechoslovakia, she was faced with a field barricaded.
The bath designed by Dusan Jurkovic architèque in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Casting a glance out the window of the building in Art Nouveau-red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The palace of baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases can discover not only neo-Roman elements emerging from its conception in 1844 but still room Moorish style Alhambra which was added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the palace thermal still the favorite bathing pool of expert, Iris Meder - and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
&quot;It&#39;s already a nice performance as melting building styles so different in so formidable a unit,&quot; said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines in detail the speculation in raw materials
Christian Teevs
German bank abandons it&#39;s speculation on commodities?
According to information SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann appointed a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the group leader will then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: In one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculating in commodities such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue them this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report from Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author emphasizes Harald Schumann in this article as speculation stock exchange on global commodities, pushing prices up and the banks share a complicity in the global famine.
The campaign to protect consumers effectively aligns against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting the same way.
Speculation in commodities was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But most experts share Meanwhile opinion bettors broke free offers and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded differently to criticism of U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, &quot;no business is worth jeopardizing the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
According to information of a SPIEGEL ONLINE International Working Group is examining charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of Deutsche Bank to be presented - with recommendation usual.
In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete surrender.
Ackermann builds its Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Speculation on rising food prices shows a particularly draconian, how the banks Today harm the public interest. &quot;
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation.
&quot;Deutsche Bank should remove all of its investment portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation&quot; Bode said.
&quot;It does not matter, for Mr. Ackermann, if the issue of starving people, or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake&quot;
Awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the group&#39;s CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that President of the Board will not change what is provided in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its image with the abandonment of agricultural speculations controversial.
And about potential losses, it has little to worry about - his successor in preoccupy.
Termination by one of two investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the manager.
To date more than 30,000 Internet users have already joined the campaign organization.
Bode has released the survey Tuesday, which with the November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute has conducted surveys among 1,001 persons.
Just one percent thought it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which paris on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also derive some personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate following the survey, all investments in which money is injected into speculation about the raw materials.
43 percent déconseilleraient such a bank to their friends, 49% said they would consider termination of their account to change &quot;bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion has moved
In Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with the ups and downs and a happy ending: the Austrian Pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 has won awards, was a museum in Vienna, has remained empty and fell into disrepair.
Now it has reopened and serves as home exposure.
If we enthusiasm for postwar architecture modern, for its clear shapes, glass hangar, his paces bright and bold and new construction materials that are typical of belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Fair in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion Schwanzer once received the &quot;Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture&quot; for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is seen to this day as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He has made so famous architects, he also built the Pavilion for Expo next Austrian.
With its legendary home of BMW four-cylinder and its construction adjacent bowl-shaped in Munich, he eventually became famous internationally in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary structure was exposed after the Universal Exhibition in the Garden of Switzerland at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang art, not a good environment.
However it has been used so long, until &quot;that contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and was increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, it is now called &quot;The House of the 21st century&quot; and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a lucky break at any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth among other skater in later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim museum as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out the particular alterations to politicians and the protection of monuments, she received public funding and private sponsorship and established operations.
Except for contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name were exposed, a cafe and a bookstore are there, and one office must be built.
Strict supervision, budget
To achieve Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because it had transformed and expanded with sensitivity Olbracht secession of Joseph and he had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was &quot;a place extremely important &quot;place where he had seen&quot; virtually every weekend &quot;exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness after his trip to Vienna and its change in use.
During the current changes, there were big problems: the &quot;building was&quot; a gulf in energy, &quot;said Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows on the glass were changed, the insulating glass reinforced fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel sifted between home and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it&#39;s almost a new building, but still light Schwanzer Pavilion.
Exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red-brown.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it once was.
And all this under close supervision by competent authorities for the monuments and a small budget.
&quot;Often materials that are good and cheap to be found, and also that appeal to the Office of the monuments protection&quot;, said Krischanitz and it draws attention to a bare floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the &quot;building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot;which came from Brussels,&quot; said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of &quot;Drop-in-the-City&quot;.
Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;awaken the conscience.&quot;
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it&#39;s a fluke of urban construction: around the Garden Switzerland stands precisely the &quot;central station area&quot; while newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps occur: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Art Center Berlin temporary, and as he says It is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the vicinity of Garden Switzerland.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a plan-crisis, which aims to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; in this regard will spend more than 70 million extra this year.
The daily &quot;Bild&quot;-Zeitung reported previously by invoking an internal crisis plan group, as investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015.
This should lead to better availability of vehicles and also the rail network in the extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of rail facilities and docks should, among other double to 16,000 people.
The goal is to rid the banks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of switches needed to service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube has warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had enormous problems for the transport of &quot;users, because it lacks among other reserves in the event of severe weather.
Thus many new regional trains have been waiting years for a permit from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years what to do, since it must check the axles of ICE trains significantly more often in the workshop, after a break axles took place on an ICE Cologne Central Station.
The German bank &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; pays millions of penalties in the United States.
After the affair of the chief Josef Ackermann is something new in the United States: German bank &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; is fined s &quot;amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant industry catches up and more United States: Institute of Frankfurt compared pays $ 145 million (106 million), for resolve a dispute because of the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to the big banks a range of charges, and to encourage cooperative banks have to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products, they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost significant value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
&quot;We are pleased to have found a solution on this, without the parties initiate proceedings in court,&quot; said a partner of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognized any comparative fault.
This also applies for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $ 20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for the cooperative banks of the United States and is involved in bankruptcy, to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair damage incurred billions of dollars.
Comparisons are now concluded the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken part in other major banks and has been assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents it is &quot;Mortgage-backed Securities&quot;.
The houses are in credit at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, This was fatal for many banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, investment bank Lehman Brothers of the United States collapsed.
Even if the events were put in a few years, now it blows on U.S. banks a whirlwind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals for redress or punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, two financial property of &quot;American statesmen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#39;s&quot; have an advantage in kind during business mortgage of about $ 200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, this is a number of transactions totaling $ 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
Supervisors asking that the Frankfurter meets the &quot;substantial losses&quot; but still without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank has dismissed the claims as unfounded and says he wants to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases of 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, investing huge sums in IT company IBM.
Since March, he bought shares worth over ten billion dollars.
Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett always says not to invest in IT software companies, as the &quot;long-term evolution of societies reveal that poor prognosis.
However, he read the reports from IBM and has changed his views on investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM offers mostly services and information systems for sectors other IT companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered an attack knight in the world of finance.
Therefore the activity IT IBM grants the right to call this &quot;Mr. IBM&quot;.
Buffett revealed today as the &quot;CNBC business program, which he bought in March of IBM stock worth $ 10.7 billion.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway investment has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything of that commitment so far.
He commended the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided a reasonable profit.
&quot;You did a great job,&quot; said Buffett strategically.
IBM put some time on the lucrative IT services as an &quot;operating center accounting.
The computer pioneer, dating back over 100 years, offering both software and consulting company that calculators very efficient.
Buffett had hitherto rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses he understands business.
But unlike Buffett attacks rather to rail freight, to manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Holding his Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as share with a number of big companies like Coca-Cola and the Munich Re, Munich Re is the former.
This octogenarian had taken 81 years in the 60 &quot;small textile company Berkshire Hathaway, and had raised to the rank of one of the most prestigious global corporations, through smart investments.
But his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors worldwide.
His almost infallible sense for making money earned her the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;.
Following the announcement of Buffett&#39;s investment shares of IBM rose one percent in the stock market.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is also called, has a market value totaling more than $ 220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft are among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said he does not want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the &quot;cell Zwickauer&quot; Turkish media have questioned the state of German law.
A newspaper is even talk of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot;, which now reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the Germano-Turkish population reacts with fear and anxiety.
Because for many of the Germano-Turkish spectrum was believed dead long since re-emerged: since the attacks of inflammatory Mölln in November 1992 and May 1993 in Solingen, there is more violence was comparable with that context Right Wing Extremist against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been a question yet.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
&quot;Is this a return to the bloody ideology&quot;, &quot;was the title of the publication on the internet the Turkish daily&quot; Haberturk &quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; stressed however that one of the authors was a v-man on the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of the extreme right.
This is a reasonable way has responded to the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish political thought had a ceremony at the fiftieth anniversary of the recruitment agreement Germano-Turkish.
With bright colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media give the impression of a slap: &quot;Germany&#39;s gift to the fiftieth anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the platform-Turkish &quot;Haber X&quot;, which refers to the context series of murders.
Also the publication of German &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not hesitate to draw unambiguous terms.
&quot;It starts to stink,&quot; This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people were murdered, would have paid taxes and contributed by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was seen very critically at the Germano-Turkish forum and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to search suspects in some circles of the extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows himself ready to at least rhetorical means even drastic: &quot;If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be migrants nothing but self-defense and armaments&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;ll be much the best self-defense&quot;.
&quot;Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network,&quot; writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
What this means if inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 90s were well explained.
The photo of the ruins after a fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory the German and Turkish.
As no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, what distrust and distance of violence could result.
However, the attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
Once this is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the Head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by its Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at that time had in his speech, how taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how much of the distrust of Germano-Turkish is deep to the &quot;local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and review of right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message this time is necessary.
The bank scandal in Lake Zürich
The Bank&#39;s most adventurous of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina meantime from one crisis to another.
This is a German who now must lead.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber s &quot;was devised.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we became aware in July 2013 it would occupy a position almost as dramatic: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected career and lucrative.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, greeted, Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength and has recently obtained pass comment on the kind of future colleagues.
&quot;UBS has managed the Turnaround&quot;.
&quot;I look forward to working with Oswald Grübel and Kaspar Villiger.&quot;
Yet as early as September it was clear that everything would change.
A trader at UBS Securities in London had diverted all the security systems of the Bank and had blazed around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Gruebel, a banker well known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has been regarded as suffering - and all ask: When Weber returned at last?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank in February 2012.
And take over the Presidency of Directors already in May - not in 2013, as the bank statement Tuesday.
For Weber it becomes difficult.
There is no banker, professor of much &quot;economy and President of the bank, and he certainly would have needed an adjustment period.
Suddenly he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of &quot;the biggest bank scandal in Europe&quot;.
Indeed, UBS is a huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and the other, she skates for years a scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, does not spare the Swiss bank so proud.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank.
So UBS was managing a side in 2007 with $ 1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
Moreover, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich said: &quot;I have always taken the UBS bank as a model of good to my students.&quot;
&quot;In today&#39;s perspective, one wonders: how is it that I could have simply mistaken on this point?&quot;
It is profoundly mistaken.
In 2007 he appeared for the first time that something was amiss at UBS.
In mid-President Peter Wuffli retired, surprisingly, which was considered previously as a senior banker and a great intellectual.
A few months later was approached about why he was gone.
The division of the bank had flamed with documents sub-prime and the write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase amounting to 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For that she actually found investors, but, shortly before, had frowned: a background of Asian non-transparent state from Singapore and a background of Arab state, which was ignored to the point we never even learned his name.
This n &#39;that was nevertheless the first shot.
In April 2008 it became worse.
The bank would announce further losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board Marcel Ospel, who in 2006 was still the second board the highest paid in Switzerland, retired.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was given his bad investments in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.
The national bank UBS bought the tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss gave six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become part owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shaken - as she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the total assets of UBS&#39;s 2007 &quot;rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
&quot;We were not able to save UBS again,&quot; said the researcher banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster he was followed by the second.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data in the affluent, who had evaded taxes perhaps with the help of Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $ 780 million - for repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
So UBS has published more or less it helped to tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich client: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
There followed the withdrawal of the head of the Board and President of the Board.
And the exodus of cash from customers.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two sectors main business: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of using tax evasion.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as was thought, that UBS would come out, there followed this unfortunate history as merchants: one merchant as a blaze, 7 billion, before the bank realizes that something was amiss.
And it publishes: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
&quot;With Adoboli the case, it was found that the risk control in too little change,&quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute, University of Zurich.
As the CFO of a large German bank is sure: &quot;the problem is that UBS did not risk control in hand.&quot;
But it was exactly the idea of ​​prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function, that of becoming a guardian of the great fortunes of the world: not too great a risk, but security for the money - and the world might collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as the Lindt &amp; Sprüngli chocolate are a particularly noble.
The center of the UBS in Zurich is still associated with the solid shot of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank is headquartered in Zurich main station, which leads directly to the central station in Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snow-capped mountains of Switzerland.
The buildings here are prestigious, rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany&#39;s, they are found here between the stores of Swiss traditions like those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: the National Bank through the palace to the Credit Suisse private bank Julius Baer as elitist.
We arrive in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, to be located in thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for &quot;safe&quot;.
The UBS knows what the customer search here: security.
This idea of ​​the Swiss bank one day either removed from the market - or betrayed the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as chief of a small Swiss private bank located.
He would prefer not to read his name in the paper, finally, like all Swiss bankers he also does business with two major banks.
UBS would become too large, you find it - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would also common.
The Swiss do not have anything to say.
&quot;And even though they have long since adapted to the manners of the Anglo-Saxon.&quot;
This was indeed the investment bank Anglo-Saxon has changed UBS, she made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the major Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent 15 October 2008.
&quot;On Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The crash of the UBS.&quot;
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the large bank.
How could this happen?
If one talks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks have together entered into a huge group.
A bank was established, which was too big for the little Switzerland - and has recorded a constant increase.
What helped is that the two banks of different prédécesseuses UBS completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with a focus on the Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer but more certainly already highly internationalized .
Suddenly, the international investment banks have had a favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board.
&quot;I always thought that Ospel and Wuffli were a dream team,&quot; said the researcher banks, Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, who can hear very well and statistical models, and Ospel, the intuitive, which has found its way to the top with the learning of the bank.&quot;
But Ospel would have relied up &quot;at the end to Wuffli.
Wuffli and would probably committed at the end a decisive mistake: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;This is a tragic fall.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The staff remembers clearly UBS executive meetings during which the group leader Wuffli gave always the same slogan: dethroning Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the investment bank&#39;s most powerful on the planet.
She ordered the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which were documented at that time the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
Business advisors, who were responsible, however, noted a weakness in the international operations of interest in banking jargon &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there would be a huge difference compared to larger banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. Mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS has embarked on an adventure which nearly cost him life.
Growth thirsty, it is both the bank itself created a background of management before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that raced and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages - but also retained risk.
Even when other banks had long sought to descend.
&quot;Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. housing market was in flames, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, the banking expert.
More is great euphoria over the fall is brutal.
One manager after another had to leave, when to end the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS became ejection and are far bancaux.
He who leads the major bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested disappeared.
The researcher bank, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in asset management, return with Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) go so far.
But the investment bank must wither vigorously, as this is clear up &quot;now.
Next Thursday the head of Sergio Ermotti bank wants to show the world its future strategy.
The Italo-Swiss aged 51 was supposed to be only a temporary basis when the bank broke away with surprise by his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it has become: it must lead sustainable business of UBS, a statement Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it will not suffice.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what does she make money?
These are the questions that &quot;Axel Weber has probably already asked.
He said publicly only that far fetched an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered &quot;problem birds °&quot; But experts say that these highly intelligent animals no longer allow hunting of cities long ago.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities resident complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote against the &quot;No problem bird&quot; is not yet in sight.
At the first symposium on ostfriesisch crows, experts said it is no longer possible to drive the rooks cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are seeking alternatives in cities
The conservationists were based urban issues also on the exodus of specially protected Rook: The use of chemicals in agriculture destroy more traditional living spaces.
Hunting, development and the felling of trees typical of brooding made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs nesting in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, won a controversial attack ads because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics have found in catching birds in traps and killing them with clubs particularly brutal.
&quot;The expulsion normal, the ouster, no use&quot;, said the town planner and landscape Leer, Werner Klover.
Destruction of nests by using pressurized water or fell trees, often produces unintended consequences, said the expert environmental Manfred Kaiser Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;The animals will move, large colonies divide and disperse them in other places.&quot;
The &quot;crowding is conceivable that in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We are forced to live with them, we can not exterminate them.&quot;
The problem can not be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, in the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the ouster of an aversive conditioning in animals and teaser offers, and enable them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and anthropologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospecting &quot;info panels instead of chainsaws&quot; to build relationships with completely different: &quot;We are finally able to better withstand a button face with a dose of confidence. &quot;
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-path-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the lives of these very intelligent Rook.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical noise caused by birds: &quot;That&#39;s a lot of communication, these birds have much to say.&quot;
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only instruments of work to get to a treat but they make their own tools as tools.
Ethologists of Cambridge University recently were testing four rooks, how come the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned they had to do with scaffolding collapse stones to thereby achieve a larva.
Without much practice, they recognized that a stone was to be determinately certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, crows were smart then solve the problem more stocky.
Placed vertically in a cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their booty with their beaks.
However, researchers had placed pieces of wire to them.
All four animals formed with a hook with which they fished the small bucket of small pipe.
Three of the four rooks we even managed early.

The mass cull staff
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Entitled &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War&quot; (The beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), he begins with a long list of characters who shakes your heart.
A tip to get started: Carefully tear this page and make it your bookmark.
You&#39;ll learn about these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be confused and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Here he wrote a book that describes unusual, accurately, as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It features some familiar names, important treaties or famous battles, we find almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials.
This is not so much a book about what happened, he says, a &quot;book describing what it would look like.&quot; Included are &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; summarizes experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less common on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls to botanists and climbers, to doctors, paramedics and sellers.
Some become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some lose limbs, become mad or lose their lives.
Their lives here as flickering candles of a church: while some go out, we turn back to new.
Peter Englund&#39;s book departs from traditional history books.
It gives the lie to the idea that the First World War is about more than the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; aptly describes other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids, the tsetse flies are a problem intractable.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people as a natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina such a stinking of cordite.
When the cannon sounded in the distance, and you are a housewife, do you stay or do you fly?
Who will come anyway?
Hardly anyone can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, &quot;the lack of facts has been expanded by the assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; following individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a nurse in English of the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but more are preserved due to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most tackle deprivation and ability to cope.
In telling the story of a schoolgirl German, Peter Englund wrote: &quot;ersatz, ersatz everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitutes, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, tires, paper wooden buttons.&quot;
He goes on food replacement in Germany.
He describes the &quot;meat made of cooked rice crashed into the mutton fat (and finished with a faux wood bones); tobacco made from dried roots and skin dried potato; soles of shoes wood. &quot;
It says &quot;837 licensed meat substitute is recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 coffee substitute.&quot;
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and says of the war: &quot;You feel that after all, this is what men were destined, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretend that such a coating is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched shirt and studded.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes he may well die, and nobody will notice or do not pay attention.
&quot;When one is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience,&quot; he writes.
This is unfortunately quite comparable to &quot;a strangled man sentenced in secret.&quot;
Other observations concerning the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.
&quot;The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition&quot; writes Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the plants.&quot;
It took the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically convinced, well-trimmed clothing, running his butcher while sitting behind a desk . &quot;
People act in unexpected ways, there are as many basic behaviors that heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes to avoid the service at the front.
&quot;We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, the soldiers and buy s&quot; spread to the genitals in hopes of finishing in the hospital, &quot;he wrote.
&quot;The most desperate apply on the eyes, which results in blindness for life.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund&#39;s prose is supple but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to its task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped the way the war has &quot;unleashed uncontrollable forces only: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion.&quot;
People begin to wonder why their leaders are a war.
The best books on World War are often indirect, such as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (The Great War and Modern Memory) by Paul Fussel, or &quot;On the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque rather than comprehensive.
Peter Englund&#39;s book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning piece I have read in a non-fiction work.
I do not reveal.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, before it hands the page containing the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
Monday night to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be most empty.
The operation remained secret to all except a few senior officers and other informed at the outset that they would conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence on the possible risks and challenges for the Police Department.
He could not be any repetition of &quot;episodes in recent weeks, such as using pepper spray against protesters, who went against the Department&#39;s regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean the park of its demonstrators Zuccotti was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
S police &quot;were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on &quot;Randall Island, for the operation in Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures which are to quickly move large numbers of police officers - a focus on lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday evening, near the East River from Manhattan.
The orders to move into the park succeeded &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said a regular, referring to the operation as &quot;a simple exercise.&quot;
&quot;The few police officers I know and who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person on condition of anonymity.
&quot;The only ones who know they are there to make it top of the hierarchy of the Police Department.&quot;
The city has attracted a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation.
Oct. 14, police wanted to clean up the park but are made by pushing hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday&#39;s operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces across the district - dozens of officers familiar with the neighborhoods especially criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went in the park during the day, how to migrants. One o&#39;clock was therefore a propitious time.
&quot;It is appropriate to make the park when the fewest people,&quot; he said.
Of emergency services vehicles equipped with spotlights and speakers gathered at Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and messages recorded resounding speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While community affairs officers were entering the park equipped with their light blue windbreaker, many protesters have simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 Police said, which left time for occupants to collect their belongings.
Other police teams have been sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were necessary.
Journalists at the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of Police, said the measure had been taken solely by security.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the work inside the park, roughly detained by officers.
Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
While the police was moving westward through the thick tangle of business demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags full of clothes, crews from the Department followed sanitation, cleaner all that the occupants had left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved methodically to stop.
A dozen persons at the epicenter of the camp were hooked together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the padlock.
No arrests have taken place in the park before 3:30 said Kelly.
According to police, the cleaning operation was completed about one and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most &quot;disturbing public order and rebellion.&quot;
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of Police, is the senior officer s to &quot;be found at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, &quot;not to direct the operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, where assistance is needed.
Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police broaden the scope beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people to keep them away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a car Police. Others were seen trying to puncture tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood flying arose from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of the city continuing school aid for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of educational assistance who lost their jobs last month plans to bring a lawsuit Wednesday in the city for layoffs unnecessary and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionately on schools serving disadvantaged students.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, District Council of 37th, to try to overturn the dismissals.
Six one hundred seventy-two aid school, parents and coordinators of other employees, part of the lowest paid of the city, have lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders have compared the dismissals to a political revenge for not having left the city for access to a fund managed by health care worker groups, and that would have to close the budget gap last spring.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget ended in June.
One Board member responded, stating that the dismissals of school aid n &quot;were no specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council&#39;s 37th District said they would fill a notice of claim, notifying the department of education he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce lawsuits in the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the department of &quot;education of the city will be the defendant. The plaintiffs are represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or Hispanic-American, like most school aid who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the trial and therefore can not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union would build on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest neighborhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying the poorest schools lose the most aid due to underfunding regular.
While one does not have any dismissal on Staten Island, and some only in institutions or TriBeCa Upper East Side, 17 assists schools have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts South Bronx neighborhoods.
Noting the loss of five assists in eight school employees in 36 public school in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claim that &quot;This is not a neighborhood of affluent parents who can bring money for fill the gap budget. &quot;
The budget of the &quot;Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each entry of&quot; disadvantaged student.
The union also claims that the directors of high schools have been misled by some words in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo uses the term &quot;tolerance&quot; to describe the action, even if &quot;overshoot&quot; describes generally the action of moving a school teacher to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, &quot;sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed&quot;, and &quot;not only because of tolerance&quot;.
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on the issue of Libya
It seems finally that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Lybia.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the U.S. involvement.
The foreign relations committee of the Senate will decide next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauded the Libyan people for their rebellion and U.S. troops for their &quot;courage&quot;.
&quot;This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry.
&quot;It&#39;s bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
The language may be harmless but the debate over Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties are in conflict, and with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, McCain and Kerry introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been a Senate vote.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has remained a form of purgatory legislative - Congress upset enough to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut his grass underfoot.
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgent in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee &quot;welcomes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom&quot; and &quot;welcomes men and women of U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism fantastic. &quot;
The resolution also says &quot;the national interest of the United States to achieve a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
The new measure does win the support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or she divide legislators as last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Board Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the final version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, backed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), be the first constitutional amendment on budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments but not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions of the House only to the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who &quot;would control federal spending.&quot;
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to bask their resume - the chance to boast of being the &quot;author&quot; of such a measure.
The Law on Control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August called for the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted on a nonbinding resolution supporting the idea of ​​such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and healthcare, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as the amendment prohibiting desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to authorize the cancellation of federal law if two-thirds of the States were opposed.
So eager they were, the members to offer amendments, they are not as rapid as in the past.
During the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, 66 and introduced during the 110th.
The pace slows relative to the early 1990s, when members proposed amendments generally more than 150 every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments did not have much more success they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
&quot;Massacred but not beaten&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D - Arizona) appeared Monday night in a TV show, sang &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; from Broadway and said they wanted above all to recover rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance on the news &quot;20/20&quot; on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled to form sentences and needed assistance to walk.
The &quot;issue discussed his difficult return after the ball that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote the text on the debt ceiling.
During his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;.
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said &quot;pretty good&quot;.
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of one hour of &quot;20/20&quot;, broadcast on the eve of the output torque of the new book entitled &quot;Gabby : a story of courage and hope. &quot;
The &quot;special program traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8.
In video filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, you can spot on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors teach him how to run simple actions.
A nod.
Movement of the lips.
And finally, his first words: &quot;What&quot;.
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) to request to change the menu of breakfast.
The videos released by ABC shows the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors look of Cyndi Lauper &quot;Girls Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty &quot;Free Fallin &#39; ? &quot;.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, it was just him reading about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and aggressively treated while awaiting trial.
&quot;There were many dead,&quot; said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
During her recovery, said Mark Kelly Diane Sawyer, she said &quot;I was beaten.&quot;
&quot;So I would say,&quot; Gabby, you have not been beaten, &quot;said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And you&#39;ll get out, you recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about the powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines around him.
The crowd in suit and tie stood up to his feet to cheer.
&quot;The military men and women, are considered heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, organizer of the fundraiser in the spring.
A high-ranking military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of &quot;Staff of the armies of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways.
&quot;They were presented as a kind of orphan,&quot; wrote the high-ranking military in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that &quot;was not respected. Just pity.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that moved between the military and American audiences passionate but often remote.
Are lavished praise the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly as if he were sorry for men and women in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
&quot;But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.&quot;
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, not wishing to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops revenantes of the Vietnam War was far worse.
Thus, most conversations take place on pity in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two son&#39;s battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some people would watch with respect as they were faced with insurgents and have traveled to distant lands.
Others are wondering if &quot;a veteran angry and violent lies beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in Government in Washington.
When looking for a job, he said, he felt that some persons who were passing interviews subtly asked if he could bear up under the stress of demanding jobs in Washington immediately after his return of combat.
&quot;When you approach this service, you are faced with negative impressions,&quot; says the Colonel Cancian when he talks to his son.
Difficulties Military emerge, in part, from indifference to American wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country as unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;As a nation, we do HARVESTING more heroism in the same manner as the Second World War,&quot; said Lt. Gen. David Barno retired, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the people and politicians focus largely on the depth of suffering of a soldier.
The troops are known for the number of periods of service endured, the number of lost friends or extent of injuries.
The military face increasing pressure to take action against rapists
This week, a hearing will decide whether capital 28 men and women will go to trial against the Army for alleged inaction on rape.
Where applicable, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
Private 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a soldier.
C &quot;was in October 2008. She was returning to his barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dining with a friend when she met a fellow carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
&quot;C&quot; was a red flag, &quot;said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan has set aside his concerns.
I thought: no, he is 19.
&quot;It is Texas,&quot; she said.
&quot;I should have followed my intuition.&quot;
A few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed her from behind, knocked down and raped, she says.
This week, Nov. 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others not, anxiously await the court decision in a trial to be held in historic Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a lawsuit brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape within the military, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also argue that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says to attack the military laced, because the problem starts with them.
&quot;The army is a vertical structure,&quot; she said.
&quot;Who are the individuals in a position to&quot; eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. &quot;
Counsel also stated that since February, she was contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, many of which could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: instead of collecting all the complainants in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it will institute a number of trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek, detailing the strategy of defense, and basically the fact that the army can not be pursued by soldiers or off duty for injuries in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries to personnel on active duty.
&quot;The harm alleged is inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs&#39; documents indicate.
The Defense Department declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 50s.
While women have still not officially allowed to go into battle, this distinction is made only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important, particularly for contact with local women.
The result of these two wars, 150 female soldiers were killed - two thirds in combat situations.
It is time to modernize the army said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in most of his.
At the &quot;Yale Law School, the legal service of veterans prepares a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnosis of &quot;personality disorders&quot; attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively Ordinary, according to activists like Anu Bhagwaru Service Women&#39;s Action Network Action Network (military women), a group for human rights.
His group has filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to process applications for benefits for people who report having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded from the center of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon&#39;s own estimate, this represents about 13.5% of 19.000 incidents that year.
The report published in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of registered cases in the military have been a trial - half the percentage of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of rape within an hour after the event.
That night, she said, she was asked to recount in detail 11 times her rape at different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge at a trial in which it is asked about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six witnesses testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was delivered,&quot; said Elizabeth Lyman.
&quot;I thought I would start having contractions. I started yelling at the court.&quot;
&quot;I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander&quot; It was not his trial but mine &quot;.&quot;
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was sent back under less than honorable terms, preventing him from receiving any benefits.
Is that the case of Lyman and other plaintiffs will advance or not, this is a long history, said John Turley, a law professor at the Law Faculty of the University of Washington.
However, he notes, &quot;In my opinion, they should move on.&quot;
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrents arising from responsibility.
&quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it is important that they try,&quot; he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, counsel for the plaintiffs, will bring together the hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials.
&quot;We continue to fight against the army on this issue until there will be no reform,&quot; she says.
Where up &quot;that we die, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just a guy expressing his anti-immigration line.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted he was taken to a killing spree in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being over cyberspace: he had spent much time before the attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions who support nationalist extremist groups right on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers interested in learning more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy ... Connect to Facebook.
&quot;We realized that no&quot; was not that hard to find them, &quot;said Jamie Bartlett, author of a recent report by the think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find people they want with scientific precision - how marketers have done for years.
The &quot;team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half-million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. She has targeted with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product ads inviting users to answer a survey. The questions concerned their education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
Coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and her colleagues were able to question 14 10.000 supporters of extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
&quot;This is a new way of doing research,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: fans online right-wing groups are usually men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, &quot;people associate activism online and offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.&quot;
The &quot;study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to investigate all matters affecting health issues such as social trends, thanks to &quot;Like&quot;, publications on the walls and status updates.
With over 800 million active users who add content by an average of three days, the &quot;supernova data&quot; generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research site whose name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you could not close the street.
&quot;Before, when you were trying to conduct surveys of people of British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot;
&quot;You had to go to the party, but they do have never allowed to enter,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information.&quot;
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address health and social problems.
A recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who talked about their exploits on Facebook while intoxicated had a lot more likely to be alcoholics than students discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often alcohol.
&quot;You can not treat a problem if you do not diagnose,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author Megan Moreno and director of the center for health, behavior and child development at the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
&quot;We know how to identify children at risk, and that would in another case not recognized.&quot;
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The &quot;team site that deals with data studied statistics on the situation on the day of love and Valentine, the turnout in the midterm elections of 2010 and a National Happiness Index (using information only available - the champions of freedom digital have long argued that the site could make available his wealth of data to other persons for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles, the site is authorized to access your information.
But what happens when it Facebook users are part of an investigation they have not even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
&quot;I do not think that many users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
&quot;As much as they know, exchanges were seen by their friends.&quot;
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how true a profile or on the wall of a user.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two totally different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a research technology, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and pen are the best tools we can use.
&quot;Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social studies is supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not at a computer.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: the first appearance of Anders Breivik Behring
Behring Anders Breivik, the man who admitted organizing the two attacks that have left 77 dead in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter &quot;resistance&quot; during his first appearance at the trial that takes place in Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement in Norway and the Knights Templar,&quot; he says before a courtroom filled with 500 people.
&quot;Regarding the court&#39;s jurisdiction, I reject, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
The judge interrupted Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue because it &quot;would not allow him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to relatives of victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim judge also asked the police to keep in custody Breivik twelve weeks more, he was forbidden to speak to the media for four weeks and warned that authorities would monitor very closely all correspondence and requests for eight weeks.
Thirty survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look into the eyes Breivik, others to be sure it would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
&quot;I found it cold and inhuman,&quot; said one survivor Utoya the Norwegian television channel NRK.
&quot;I don&quot; was not comfortable, but I have personally made some progress after having seen and heard the suspect. &quot;
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when entering and exiting the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of &quot;resistance&quot;, the judge determined that he was not mad. He also said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may give comfort some.
But this does not reduce grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
&quot;I would have preferred it looks like a monster, but this is not the case,&quot; said a relative of a victim.
&quot;It would have been much easier.&quot;
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, the movies this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some have compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical genius and inventor of the modern computer.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs recently and found to be broadcast this week in the first part of a film in major markets, this is how he understood the creative process and workflow products.
It was definitely a creator and a dreamer. He was identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, and an enhancer of charts - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a &quot;disease into thinking that a great idea because 90% of the work ... [but] a considerable amount of manual labor separates a great idea for an exceptional product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;. This series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, to a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transit.
Only after the death of Steve Jobs is a complete video found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly rising, is the basis of the film entitled 68 minutes Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, to be shown at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hate-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to exhibit technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
From four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the issues - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to give a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs&#39; perfectionism resurfaces, he seems eager to hear issues Cringely, giving nudges to do it faster and proceed to questions or topics of utmost importance.
Filmed before the &quot;era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient in Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it considers good or bad in other companies and expressed his own vision on the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to look at the reviews of the posthumous career of Steve Jobs, but there is something raw and inspirational man we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He then explains away the dishes out.
Here&#39;s a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
&quot;All these years I always asked: &#39;Why are you doing things?&quot; and the answers are always the same: &#39;Oh, just because you have to do. &quot;
Nobody knows why, no one is thinking deeply to things in a company.
This is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of its efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused as to how costs were recorded - it often begins with a &quot;standard cost&quot; estimated at a rough guess, and then adjusted with a &quot;change&quot; - he developed an automated factory which guaranteed the accurate calculation of trade costs.
The opportunity to play a trick to Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;Blue Box&quot; which he founded with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone systems and call for free long distance.
The unit has been the subject of many writings previously, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He described how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, via a call and then by connecting an AT &amp; T network to another while bypassing many satellites as possible.
&quot;We wrapped it the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and it happened to you a minute later the public telephone next door,&quot; says Jobs, laughing.
&quot;We were young and with this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something themselves able to control billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world.&quot;
We did not know much about them both, but we managed to invent a small thing can control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not think Apple has ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two friends go on laughing just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with the technology (and solicitation of Bill Hewlett):
In the &quot;age 12, hunting for parts to build a frequency counter, he looks Bill Hewlett number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20 minutes of conversation, Steve Jobs gets a summer job part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;This has had a remarkable influence on me. C&quot; was the only company I had seen at that age and this has shaped my definition of a business and how employees are treated. &quot;
Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the &quot;first computer ever made.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small CRT. I fell in love.
The teenager that I &quot;was returned to HP and began writing programs for this machine.
Improvisation on innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember the big fights ... I shout at me claiming he would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $ 300]. I&#39;ve had enough, I got out and went to a designer. &quot;
Eighty-six days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $ 15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On large companies that run out of steam:
Long before he might renew Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better printer copier or better, and after?&quot;
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it is these types of people] that ultimately lead companies and specialist personnel are being produced in the &quot;margins of decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly is rotten by people who can not imagine designing a good product from bad product - manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could hold the entire computer industry.
She could have done ten times its current size. Xerox was the Microsoft of the 90s ...
They snatched defeat to victory.
On innovation as an art form:
&quot;A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea for an exceptional product ... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
There are trade-offs ... Some things you can not do, the electrons can, glass, spam, plants also.
You need to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and try to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We always ashamed to steal good ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have just found the best computer scientists in the world.
If this is for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health law when the court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets in camera to consider the question of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama&#39;s health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm will defend the case before the high court.
The event was located last Thursday when nine judges met for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One case in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the health care reform ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument between 5.30 is expected in March, and the result will probably be likely to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the moment the court&#39;s decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a group dedicated to defend longstanding legal principles conservatives.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day is one of the trade associations that have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference the court on the matter.
Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican and outspoken opponent of the law of health.
Featured dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they probably would argue with the code of Canon 4C, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fund-raising organizations and other related law that the judge can not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or included on the agenda of such an event. &quot;
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two law firms of the case, and to a firm with a financial interest massif, was enough to alarm the activists of Government Ethics.
&quot;This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges as the Court shall respect the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
&quot;Judges and drank and dined at a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.&quot;
Their presence and participation in the fundraising event belies any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they too easily blend the business of the court with the agenda of groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39;s wife, Ginni, is an activist conservative high-profile.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim it is the judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law were raised at the trial court.
His critics have pushed for Kagan recuses himself to hear the case, saying she was too invested in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing recorded a record order of $ 18 billion for airliners
Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners twin-aisle, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at over one billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.
Instead, this is a big deal when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 had reached a record $ 18 billion.
Equally amazing is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine growing future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years to 2520 had a total value of $ 450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the control of commercial aircraft the most expensive in history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle.
It&#39;s Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this Pharaonic command.
Boeing announced at Dubai Airshow in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more planes, which would raise the total amount of the order to $ 26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts of fuel economy and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six aircraft s &quot;amounts to over a billion dollars.
&quot;This is clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
&quot;These customers in particular have immense value.&quot;
In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have many of their airlines.
They not only afford these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important costs - they would not be so harmful as the country would benefit from the money with the rise in oil prices.
This is important because these companies are less likely than others to cancel or defer aircraft orders when oil prices rise, reported Dihora.
&quot;They have a natural hedging,&quot; he said.
Emirates strengthens the control of the dominance of Boeing in the market for jumbo jets and helps stop the attempted encroachment of rival Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing&#39;s victory in the airshow comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the debut of the bigger version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes its inception to increase the thrust at the request of its customers to increase its carrying capacity and autonomy.
Shares of Boeing rose 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly defeated in elections in Michoacán
Maria Luisa Calderon says drug dealers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo PRI in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its access attempt for Governor of Michoacán during violent election, and said Monday that drug traffickers have encouraged one of his opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of that state from the west.
&quot;The involvement of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only in Michoacán but for the whole country,&quot; noted Maria Luisa Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the election.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our polling agents ... They took the ballot boxes, have set up roadblocks ... and forced people to vote&quot; for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until &quot;to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organized his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the &quot;presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out as little Calderon, who was leading in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, Vallejo refused to recognize the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Party of Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently serves as governor, came in third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 left the divided and unhappy.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the early results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the &quot;State, has denied any links with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialize in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the &quot;home state of President Calderon, and he chose to Michoacán launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has persisted.
A week before the election of a mayor PAN was assassinated while campaigning for Maria Luisa Calderon, and many candidates have given up locally in the country for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections in Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, Vallejo congratulated in Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for next year.&quot;
The ADB urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare for the euro area to help overcome the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of &quot;Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the Manila-based ADB said that the two economic powers in the fastest growing in the world would &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a &quot;with indifference&quot; and reported that Asian financial support alongside management and resources of Europe would to &quot;avoid a collapse of the long-term&quot; global economy.
&quot;We&#39;re all in this crisis.&quot;
&quot;So anyone can help Europe recover from the crisis is helpful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
&quot;Asia can be protected up&quot; at some point but it is not safe. &quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, nothing&#39;s stopping them.&quot;
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing is dangerously Italian skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has brought forth fear that the &quot;global economy goes into recession, and prompted the call for major emerging economies to meet the euro area to help find a solution.
Mr. Nag has foretold that the IMF would carry any help Asian, but he also said that the bilateral assistance - like buying bonds of financial rescue funds from the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided a greater power of negotiations with the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India said that &quot;India will do all it can&quot; to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
&quot;Nobody wants the euro area remains unstable and agitated,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have monumental challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800 000 live on $ 2 per day or less.
&quot;One day they discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on holiday in the sun and they will be hard to swallow,&quot; he reported.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India&#39;s reserves should be used to maintain many Greek officials paid well in low-managed loss making as in railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone was likely to cause &quot;significant impact&quot; across Asia.
The ADB forecasts economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &quot;risk of loss&quot; because of the European threat.
He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed to &quot;develop&quot; contingency plans &quot;to protect an economic downturn and large capital outflows.
Pentagon&#39;s dire warnings about potential reductions in defense
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has raised the pressure on Congress Monday, warning that budget cuts would undermine automatic imminent national security. It triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon already digested $ 450 billion of cuts over the next decade, but now fears that an additional $ 600 or more cuts is imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
&quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in the so-called sequestration, cause 23% reduction and the freezing of many new projects.
&quot;A large cut, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and our construction projects unenforceable - you can not buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage the efforts of other modernization, &quot;Panetta wrote to senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so rapidly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the objective.&quot;
&quot;These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and our preparation will damage seriously.&quot;
The reductions would affect any combat troops, Panetta continued.
&quot;Although funding wartime accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war effort would be adversely affected by serious disturbances in the base budgets,&quot; warned Panetta.
&quot;The contractor personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that support the war&quot;.
&quot;The management staff salaries would be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted.&quot;
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequence of sequestration on the Defense Department would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as head of undisputed world military power.&quot;
&quot;We are strongly opposed to this drastic action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter from Panetta.
&quot;This is not a result with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should impose&quot;.
&quot;Sequestration is a threat to national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.&quot;
Panetta&#39;s letter and the recent warnings of senators increased the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he managed himself to the highest office in the Pentagon combining years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knew that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense has painted a grim picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no nucleus.
&quot;It&#39;s a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;This is a brigade without bullets.&quot;
&quot;This is a fighter without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;This is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,&quot; Panetta said during his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force depressed, ill prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;De facto, it invites aggression ..&quot;
In an addendum to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta has stated specifically how further reductions could &quot;generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters, severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations. &quot;
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could move to ax, including those already tested and some just the early stages of planning.
That list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new littoral combat ship and the new field vehicle, replacing the Humvee army and navy.
Halt the development and testing of the F35 could generate $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how deception and lying are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican candidate for President Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covered up reports that a football coach to retire sexually abused boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed the country.
Congressman from New York celebrity and the Internet Anthony Weiner, went for a fool by issuing early denials contradicted by overwhelming evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of campaign finance violations relating to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And none of those who lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term of his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating on tests of school and university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers were given the test answers to students to ingratiate themselves on their performance evaluations.
Mentors who teach the contrary should send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How do we meet deception?
On any given day, studies show you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of them are white lies.
Another study showed that foreigners are lying on three occasions in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Identify or detect a lie is an essential skill that everyone must learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to exclaim &quot;gotcha&quot;, the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have made a thorough search for such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that the oldest myths on lies were demystified.
Liars look into your eyes.
They stutter, blush or shake does not always.
Do not conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified polygraph can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-facial expressions, the formation of the question and response time.
I spent several years reviewing the scientific results in the vast and still emerging body of knowledge on deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a skill that is modern and easy to learn useful to navigate through our complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiation and management.
Good liars are able to read the others, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies &quot;focused on them&quot; while women say no more lies &quot;other-centered&quot; - usually to protect the feelings of someone one - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried persons (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called &quot;set benchmarks&quot;.
This helps provide a benchmark for measuring future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly to avoid accusations unfair when you see it move his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for clues of deceptive behavior verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these indices as red flags, no evidence of deception.
People can stop misleading the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean toward an exit, changing posture significantly relieving or present a &quot;post-interview &quot;- an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all questions are difficult past.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to start the reaction post-interview.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Individuals can also use misleading language distanced: &quot;I have not had sex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;jargon&quot; in his response to a difficult question: &quot;Well ... to be honest ... if I remember ... to my knowledge assets.&quot;
This makes the perceptual response rather than factual, is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for lie detection, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will enhance the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal life.
The plan will be controversial pipeline rerouted after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said late Monday it will move out of the pipeline in the ecologically sensitive area of ​​the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
The Official TransCanada Pourbax Alex, says the company remains confident it will ultimately obtain approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further study of potential routes allowing avoid areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, vast underground water sources.
&quot;It&#39;s a real way forward,&quot; said Terry Lee, a Republican of Nebraska at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after elections next year, though officials deny involvement in policy making.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and he expressed his support.
The pipeline would extend from 2.735 kilometers from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700.000 barrels per day since the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, he would cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But legislators of Nebraska opposed the plan are pushing a law to force the remoteness of the area of ​​the Sand Hills and Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study under the State Department found that the project would cause only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the inspector general of the ministry ordered a separate investigation of review process, focused on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear
A family of New York says the Disco diva Patti LaBelle embarked on a rampage in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear.
The tirade of the singer &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; scared the little Genevieve Monk 18 months old, so much so that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers,&quot; said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was Nov. 10 last year while the stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to leave for family trip.
While Kevin Monk would get the car, Roseanna Monk down in the lobby of their building on the Boulevard Riverside with their luggage, with Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a while.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and told me:&quot; Do you know what your daughter? &quot;I said&quot; yes &quot;and I went to look,&quot; she said.
LaBelle has angrily admonished pregnant women.
&quot;She told me in an aggressive tone:&quot; You should not let your daughter near the door, &quot;said Roseanna Monk.
&quot;I told him:&quot; what you say or do does not interest me. &quot;
She became enraged and began using profanity - the word &quot;&quot; and the word &quot;&quot; in a loud voice ...
She had a bottle of water and began to spray water bottle.
She stated that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
&quot;I told the woman:&quot; Look what you did to my daughter, &quot;said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was thrown on the mother - who was still holding in her arms Genevieve - and had to be restrained by those around him who has driven to a waiting car, Roseanna said Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note demanding an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment.
The complaint seeks damages not specified, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity against the cancer for children.
&quot;The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with a child of 18 months.&quot;
Adversity climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of management Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in economic history of Sinaloa, is the first year of Government Mario López Valdez, called self-change, which has generated great expectations regarding advances economy, but given the climate of adversity this year, the increase was not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures of February, except to cause losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in overall economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, the main reason for the historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments from frosts by the Mexican Council of Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582 million of damage 835 hectares cultivated, including a 78.03 percent have suffered a total and remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography unemployment state during the first three quarters of the the years there has been a fast rise, because while the January-March 053 55 000 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent from July to September and average continued to increase up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74,000 sinaloens unemployed, up from the first half of 18,000 people 969.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained indirectly by the actions taken by public policy.
&quot;What we observe is an increase in unemployment is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints in the legislation approved by Congress to combat the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars from illegally it is not easy to work to earn them, they invest them and use them in something, &quot;he said.
Migration held
Lopez Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to demographic factors.
&quot;The number of persons leaving the state to go to work abroad, the U.S. has been limited, primarily because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they have already entered into many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and there asking for sources of work, so that higher unemployment, &quot;said he.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labor market worsens sinaloen considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state will not contribute as works worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for shifting the state wages are low, the entity has the lowest wages of the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly incomes of workers sinaloens was, until September, 5000 352 pesos, well below the national average is 375 to 7000 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 we recorded the greatest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment of 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy January-June the FDI State has reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars saved in the same period a year earlier.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government recognizes a total investment of 17.280 billion pesos a year, mainly by companies registered in the service sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government has asked Congress in July in public approval for a credit of 3 billion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the Congressional approval of the state was 2.600 trillion pesos and up in November we did not observe any benefit of debt in any sector of the economy the State.
Reactions
For representatives from the business sector, the first year of Government Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there has been no harmonization of the wills of different sectors, herein the State Government.
&quot;The economic performance of Sinaloa during this year was really very poor, we must work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we must double our effort, we had to align the efforts of all and especially the functioning of already synchronized the new Government team, hope that next year is much better, &quot;he said.
Slow economic
Loredo said López qu&#39;événements as frosts early attracted the state&#39;s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
&quot;The economy is down fluxed product of several events, among which the frosts, a main effect was a slow economy that does not turn quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level e flows in trials, product and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had, &quot;he said.
Redefine the role
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said we want the state to channel productive activities more dynamic.
&quot;In general terms we found that it worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program which redefined the role and the economic direction of the State, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of human and material resources of Sinaloa, &quot;he said.
Much to do
The president of the Coparmex emphasized the importance of establishing a future vision that channels the best efforts of the Government.
&quot;In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to be successful in various fields, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programming&quot;, he declared it.
He noted that the current administration has shown how advances in management of public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, I can say is that we&#39;ve worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still much to do,&quot; said it.

Debts to the contributions to books
The works contemplated in social programs like Hábitat, Rescate of Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrant may not be finished to record where serious delays due to lack of economic resources, reported Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although so far the construction programs have grown, they are in a situation of risk, because the State Government does not acquitted of his obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He reported that total investment for these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
&quot;They have to contribute $ 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they did nothing, although they had since July to give us part&quot;, he says, &quot;and we, for Register does not delay, we started the works and we have made great progress, but we need money &quot;.
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid contributions corresponding therefore early administration of the Municipality had to apply for credit to cover 7 million that the state government had not provided at that occasion.
&quot;We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to function and this year we, in order to access these programs, we get the resources duu to cover what the state had not paid, &quot;he détailla.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of state authorities to provide these resources, he said they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to enable managements to the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
&quot;They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they gave us nothing.&quot;
Court validates &quot;the analogue switch off&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog by digital REPORTED is an exchange larger than the world has suffered the last year
The Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called &quot;analogue switch off&quot; from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary for invalidate have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, herein the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, held that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow to achieve the transition digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because of the fact that the regulation of radio and TV is an award reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications ( Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve law.
In favor of the project only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero same.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies has promoted two controversial constitutional challenge to the decree and acknowledging complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions under it for digital transition.
The plenary session of Ministers also resolved dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discuss the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive can not structure through measures of general standards for public administration is preparing.
&quot;I do not consider that if he did it affect the autonomy of the regulator,&quot; and he recalled that the public policy planning in strategic areas such as telecommunications is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
The substitution of analog by REPORTED REPORTED digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last year and this results in better use of spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postpone the change, argued he would postpone the benefits of digitization involves a public policy decision that has not only a technical dimension, &quot;as it also includes economic, social, political and national security. &quot;
These issues, said he, &quot;require the operation of any system shall, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the state, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants the power of the Executive the State &quot;.
He recalled that many countries around the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done through the Executive, despite the fact that they had strong technical bodies specialized.
We can not conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the form of a sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures the administrative sphere in respect of acts by the Legislature, he assured .
It analyzes the possibility of a count &quot;vote by vote&quot; in Michoacán
According to data revealed by PREP, the difference between the first and second in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6000 74 minutes total.
Count the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality in regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where according to data revealed by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6000 74 minutes total.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines for harmonizing local standards to reform federal electoral matters.
Recall that Michoacán has not approved nor its Constitution nor the Code Electoral Politics of State or the Electoral Law of Justice, along with the State Congress approved reforms that eventually bit before the legal deadline for the trial election can take effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication on schedule by the Law of the Official Gazette of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Authority and described as &quot;illegal and invalid&quot; the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reforms, as he has no right to &quot;punish or deny&quot;.
Interviewed on the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot;, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of relevant guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to achieve partial and total counts of votes by the governing body local election.
Thus, the partial count of votes, an electoral or more packets, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide, there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the urn is not in the president thereof, or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
Moreover, the total count of votes received in all the polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the supposed difference between the candidate winning the election and respective one that got second place in the vote is equal or below a percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition representing the party&#39;s express and / or coalition presented the second candidate reported.
The total count of the vote can take place also if at the end of the countdown common it follows that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner of second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packages were part of the statement object.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 minutes total.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The prime minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The prime minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
One might expect that a firm has made in its majority by technocrats, although it is unclear when the new Executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would present to the President the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The &quot;framework is now well marked,&quot; he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government within three days, in a shorter amount of time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti has to approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy which was affected.
Underlining the pressure on it hurries to Monti, market volatility to put the Italian BTP bond yields to 10 years above the 7 percent level in which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria employers, told the media after his meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support this much government.&quot;
We believe that Government is the last opportunity for Italy to ensure that emergency.
The possibilities of success of Monti were stimulated significantly by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, the crisis which forced him to resign last Saturday.
&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result,&quot; he told reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the party center-right.
Support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members opposed the Government majority technocrat that Monti form.
Parliamentary support
Monti&#39;s new government must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what may be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could generate a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to pressure by observing that a bankruptcy would be a disaster Monti.
Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth organizations and women.
He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt are now back at critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the defenses of the current financial Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist into future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians only give him time to implement reforms before the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the test to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is greater than the Costa Rican
Of the 22 players called in Spain, ten participated in over 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of 22 invited attended 50 meetings.
Stark contrast to that of Costa Rica, when comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today at 15:05 am at National Stadium in San Jose.
While the national champions and Europe, a number of monthly FIFA rankings, account for a large register sets of inter-selected class A, only the Habs defender Michael Umana was the only one to have all 50 games International.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the League stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League, to maintain an intense year of activity in league and cup and national disputes in European cups as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the playoffs the complicated European and World Cup football.
The Costa Rican footballers, however, have limited international experience in an area, as CONCACAF, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the record of the largest Spanish selection is that of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who earlier on Saturday against England (0-1 defense in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will lay a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona driving the brain, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by the week before UEFA beside another old Iberian team, Zubizarreta above with 126 and the front-center of Schalke, Raul Gonzalez, with 102.
Centenary loan figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres, with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andres Iniesta, with 62, Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From Costa Rican Michael Umana and near the left side are Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, 32 with Randall Azofeifa, Michael Barrantes with 31, with 36 Carlos Hernandez and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The least.
Those who have less. With over 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The national side, with less than 30 appearances, appearing with Roy Miller 26, with 26 Winston Parks, Gabriel Badilla with Roy Myrie with 25 and 23.
The rest can not even at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only four games and two Jordi Alba, Víctor Bolívar in Costa Rica has only one and Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder not start yet.
The history of Spain striker David Villa is, flies with 50, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that saves the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet includes the country has in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
&quot;&quot; Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true &quot;
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to deliver one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will be a dream come true to occur in this country.
This is the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The group is in the wing of his South American tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20 is his only stop in Central America.
That day will present the National Stadium, from 19:30 hours, next to the Los Angeles band The X and National Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, including the full transcript can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
Costa Rican for its followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South America and Central and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica vacations only once and is a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days.
This excites us therefore turn our music down there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous day.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying beside us during all these years.
It took 21 years to have until we come to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so much and we are sorry that so much time had to pass up this concert.
Some people are already saying that his show is the biggest show of the year.
Is it adds a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we have available during the last 21 years occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered a gigantic two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this will put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward we produce.
We love this country, we love to surf and the jungle for two things, Costa Rica is one of the best country in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and waves for surfing?
We have lots of friends and surfers I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends would always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, near Mexico, are great places to go surfing, this is how we learned, through the gents who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you aves offered huge shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we did never products out there, we have no restrictions regarding what we can do.
We try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs and we try to sing two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What should it?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine disks and we can interpret over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that&#39;s why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we no longer interpreted very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved these songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that you have succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think none of us has imagined that we would form a great rock band, and the fact that we have done for over 20 years that it seems a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue making music together excites us a lot.
We love and we love making music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world which we have always wanted to go.
Things could get better for us.
What does it mean for you having been fundamental in the creation of grunge?
This was always an honor for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are friends with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It&#39;s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
Occasionally, a group emerges of a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups come together in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to form part of the Seattle group.
We&#39;re still playing with some of them occasionally.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with them all and it is an honor for us to form part of the Seattle sound that arises.
It is also very strange that a group like yours to maintain and united with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have to trust each other with the music of everyone and it could be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you balance?
As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game and great multitudes of people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us remember that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that one and is a famous rock star, which does not really care about any of us.
How do you remember from your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not released a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so short and most important is that we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group and when I listening to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
It was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and why you chose it to open?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and this one was the group that we loved the most, so we&#39;re excited to see what Las Robertas can provide live and this must be very distracting.
Why you always change the lyrics Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
It was he who sings it and I think it does with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are its influences?
There are so many ...
Among the first I remember there Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about bass players that I love.
How has managed Pearl Jam grunge keep falling despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful because it &#39; is music worth listening to bands like Mudhoney and are now the best music ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What must change?
It&#39;s interesting, because I think there are songs in the album that seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a slightly positive.
With both, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, without doubt, represent that for me.
I also think that we can be happy and even then you can make music obscure.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that present in magpies, informed her family physician.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffering from various ailments, including cancer following language for which he was operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television for that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that it wishes to do because he feels innocent.
He had surgery four times the language of cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 pounds weight, and other pathologies, such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori is serving life imprisonment in September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, bearing in mind the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, and consisting of various ministers and bosses, will introduce on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial and a community meeting of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive to information sharing in political affairs between the two nations&quot;, according to information released by the Presidency of the South American country on his homepage.
According to local media, trying to convince Calderon Mujica support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens in the meeting G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community and countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from this European country.
Mexican president since November the G20, a group of emerging and developed the world&#39;s strongest, and has in place with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to dispatch the realization of tax sharing agreements to end the &quot;gri list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have been in place since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes to three-dimensional &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot;
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, but he had never done in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario Land 3D&quot; he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores across the world, was designed from the beginning to fully exploit the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say must function as stereoscopy without glasses,&quot; said the head of Nintendo&#39;s press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot; is &quot;the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this media&quot; as far as success of &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: OCARINE of Time 3D&quot; was the adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman claimed that Nintendo, despite being in 3D, &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot; is a video game &quot;accessible&quot; which allows a quick and fluid.
Alvarez said that &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, most experts will make a &quot;second round&quot; at the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose between a real-time &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot;not to succumb to illusions optical &quot;.
The incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the return of the character in a mobile console, which is happening more since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a nod to fans of the saga and repeats the successful formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachioed plumber has to travel platforms mined from the dangers to free Princess Peach.
Even if I find new player in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi &quot;playable&quot;.
Colom endorses Portillo&#39;s extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday he had given orders for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to meet the United States for conspiracy to launder $ 70 million U.S..
Thus ends the trial so that Guatemala meets the demand from the north country that called for Portillo to judge.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision to obey the independence of the judiciary and executive by taking into account the fact that a trial court had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his tenure &quot;it did not help&quot; in any judicial resolution, and he gave rein to all extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Estrada and Victor Morales Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
That Colom has assumed an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional for the trial of former agent of the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing their human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million in Defense Ministry when he was president, who was the trial which preceded the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and the case was reactivated.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to prevent the marginalization of young untrained
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the entity of social support is important Trinijove: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
Add to this the long centennial workstations currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in an old industrial complex Fabra i Coats which over 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping people with little training, no work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
The celebration yesterday at Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of responsible entities and institutions in these 25 years have worked with the association.
The diverse political representation, open season election, showed the unitary nature of the work of Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas Jordi Pujol and his predecessor, attended the act the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall the former mayor and deputy mayor and current councilor eco Socialist Ricard Goma.
Were present also in the Great Hall of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and CEO of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is too, but he added that the work done so far &quot;is a good base.&quot;
The president gave as an example to see Trinijove fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
&quot;The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work it performs,&quot; ​​he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate in 11 of 13 apartments of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned property at noon yesterday without any resistance
All indications are that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 lived in Balmes street ended.
Twelve people have voluntarily given up to noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-parties who despaired neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation we changed the door lock to prevent the recurrence.
&quot;From that day there will be an access control&quot;, affirmât administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited-, is washed away and the electrical part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leave residual of any kind, especially boxes of liquor.
The first three units were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired tenants.
Besides the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that after the occupation of the building his business dropped 80% a.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of property made him the competence unfair because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to it, the troubles were not caused by customers of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and especially the participants in parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to neighbors irritated area.
The manager of the nightclub said that the troubles were so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it&#39;s been nine months that he &quot;forgives&quot; the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that last week they had received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
The President of the Municipal Group PP of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, was asked last week &quot;the immediate evacuation of the building and ending with the problems of coexistence and citizenship that it caused to residents and degradation zone &quot;.
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and in some apartments there have been flights also.
It is in this sense he added that &quot;we must end impunity and be ruthless against antisocial behavior generated in the property&quot;.
Also yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police moved to No. 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal contests on 16 doors reopen the debate on the role Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-&#39;80s, right peak of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​the Catalan capital is the only one that is not oriented on a north- south, if not above (mountain) - low (sea).
Qualification as Collserola park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was not Central Park Yellowstone otherwise, with wild boar in the role of Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a competition composed by mega-16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door gives the idea of ​​park, no doubt.
That, or someone wants to put doors on the field.
The issue appears alone: ​​Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization as regards the reflection of the city is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona.
It&#39;s almost a recurring theme, including two former members of that caste elected to recognize when they speak in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three coincide Barcelona architects, university professors, who are presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel and Marta Modol Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; discuss &quot;the front mountain&quot; because the speech Ildefons Cerda, the blocks of green has not been completed at the end.
&quot;We must start from the basis that the largest park is the beach of Barcelona.
Among other things for its accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, &quot;gave the verdict which the architect for the title of&quot; doors Collserola &quot;contains a&quot; trap lexicon &quot;: do they think&quot; like access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where action is needed &quot;.
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some peril&quot;.
Dangers that derive from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of public space&quot; after the experience in the 80s and was in the area of ​​the Forum &quot;his swan song.&quot;
The first fear is the proper border demarcation on which to build.
&quot;Limit means something already established the next step&quot;, that is to say, beyond it.
&quot;We must think of new urban instruments, planning, since the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disaster.&quot;
In addition to the standing question, Modol opine that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles region Collserola &quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, ​​no.&quot;
Modol remember that there is already work done by the Patronage Collserola which &quot;must not be lost&quot;, thanking for the opportunity that the City Council offers its corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment.&quot;
Moreover, it implies that the proximity of the mountain with the city&#39;s safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but &quot;probably&quot; if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams (&quot;a success&quot;, he says) that we had to create: &quot;We, the architects, should be only an instrument.&quot;
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex because of the bases of competition lacks an overall vision Collserola: &quot;The contest is called cross 16 - he says - meaning mountain- sea, but there is not a longitudinal direction and which includes the area as a whole &quot;.
This is, at least in this case, it has opted to participate in 16 competitions.
Alternatively, a project for one of the gates may be shocking in the program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of ​​equipment that performs a gentle transition between the city and green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the attorney&#39;s legal Red Casino has granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the lawsuit brought against him for alleged extortion
After spending 72 years arrested Manuel Jonás Larrazábal be released after the validity of the legal power of Red Casino grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Garcia Gil, published a series of photos and videos in which he allegedly Jonás Manuel demanded the payment of an economic quotte for the mayor of Monterrey allow illegal operation of the gambling house
After the public disclosure, the prosecutor opened a criminal case against the mayor&#39;s brother and PANiste September 2 it was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 of property crimes, he was transferred to a Detention Center, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he delivered a second detention order after the officer of the Public Prosecutor has dismissed corruption offenses and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the center of criminal Cadereyta alleged to have blackmailed half a million pesos and the owners of Casino Red, but he spent only a few hours in the detention center of average safe as there had death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in cells Municipal de San Nicolas de los Garza.
On October 25 an order of capture was issued by the Clerk of Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yáñez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was confirmed evidence sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the validity of the legal authority of the Casino Red, Aldo Víctor García Gómez, appeared before the judge by José Luis Pecina to beg forgiveness for the mayor&#39;s brother in the region and therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias García Gómez asked if the damage had been recovered and associates of the gambling house was the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried to withhold the name.
Under the folder 197/2011 have been granted the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and later we can make any claim relating to the lawsuit filed against him can not ask him any compensation for damage and no punishment either.
After hearing the merits of the legal authority to the gambling house, at 15:50 hours you ordered the immediate release of Bretón Larrazabal.
Clerk of Court, Jorge Yáñez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate Jonás he had been legally pardoned and his record would be classified.
He will also communicate about immediate release that the judge has issued.
Dionisio Perez Jacome The Secretary shall give details of the plane crash in which his life has lost the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and another seven
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results shown on the accident in which his life has lost the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicate that the helicopter was shocked directly against the floor full structural integrity, without the pilot to try an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary of Transport and Communications, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot noticed that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
&quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees to 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage&quot;.
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
In addition, he said the investigations carried out in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground parts.
&quot;In research we have reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft to another place, the impact is presented in a structural way.
&quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and meet the requirements for transport.
The soil had a Pante seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For now, the Secretary has ensured that priority is to have the results as soon as possible, but the investigation may take several months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services has ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter was operating in Presidential State Major speed cruiser and it happened on soft ground ascendancy.
&quot;This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operating cruiser at the time of impact,&quot; he said.
During the press conference, the owner of TBS, Perez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the normative aircraft, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, meaning that the crew must have visibility during the flight and ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports mentioned in the AICM adequate conditions for takeoff, and as and as the aircraft has moved toward the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of clouds at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is likely that &quot;because of cloud cover conditions the crew had sought a zone of lesser height and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss or alteration of or control the flight path.
Scattering of remains of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far to suppose that the impact occurred on a straight path and side.
The dispersion model of the remains of the aircraft can be assumed that the helicopter was hit against the ground in terms of structural integrity.
It did not detect traces of fire or explosion:
In place of loss there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work we found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9,000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground was on a slope that goes from seven degree C. to 30 degrees inclination .
The photographs show the sequence in which it is possibly disjointed throughout its journey.
The information provides elements which suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple Hits the ground.
After careful research in an area wider than the spot circled around the accident, we did not find the scattered pieces of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the obesity gene
Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people and this is supported by specialists in the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced he leads an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, called protocol &#39;Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents, who markers will be associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Investigation Unit in Biochemistry Medical Specialties Hospital National Medical Center in the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that they had formed a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social attend.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation be invited to participate or not having the right people, to stand for units of IMSS sports participating in Valle de México, into which any evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 pm.
He stressed that the protocol began in Unit Sports Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Oriente Estado de México).
After reaching the goal of raising 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and that e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the November 14 World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the objective is to collect three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for application specific questionnaires related to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and a history of familial inheritance of their disease, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday we will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determining the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (we try to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
&#39;The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, from 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; regarding the Overweight was observed as a dramatic increase &#39;, emphasized the specialist IMSS.
He said the justification for the search of markers is based in the fact that the country&#39;s population is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 per cent of Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which can detect if they have a degree of overweight or obese.
Ila said that even the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
Information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors transmitted in writing to parents, which explains the different measures and changes in lifestyle that they must achieve to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: a sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, spend most of their day sitting watching TV and using means transport instead to walk short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, that is to say, the greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie with cornmeal wrapped in corn husks - bread, pizza, burgers, etc..) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics discussed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM avoid currants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry, UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with higher yields, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
Reported only if the pavement were resolved, there would be no need to repair about 200 miles blackcurrant each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Valle de Mexico, warns Rafael Nájera Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM , who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is adequate, currants could be reduced or eliminated completely.
During his lecture An opinion on technology cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory which he is responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those asphalt, but with a greater mechanical strength, both at high as low temperatures.
Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of black currant.
He explained that the asphalt from heavier oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbon molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes, and molecules with low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give to pad its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is in the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state , while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the resistance in the streets of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns expert in chemical engineering.
The researcher observed that FQ streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt.
Between the more superficial is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, signalât he is bathed year asphalt.
When vehicles spend generating efforts, it allows the forces spread very well in the pavement.
If we had to modified asphalt, they would propagate better, opinât the chemical ingenuity.
On the asphalt, he said, we put a last layer called surface layer, made of stone cutting, that is to say, the sand is bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must be stronger than the mechanical layer of asphalt and provide traction on the street.
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the wearing course also requires that it has a suitable thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is that it&#39;s hard it kind, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore because of cassis.
In the process of formation of a black currant, he said, the first strike that the film is rolling and is affected only later the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
Member of the National System of Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of black currant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must be always connected to the load of vehicles and ensure their satisfaction, for avoid the frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and can easily repair the blackcurrant and without using high temperatures.
The candidate has failed in Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that Serna Melina Ramirez does not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her title of princess number 14.
Valle del Cauca again stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Serna Melina Ramirez had to settle with the fact of being on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band as the new princess accredits Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and scepter, the department already amount to 14 tracks and Princess Melina is one to one legion of women of Valle del Cauca, which are found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question that many people are asking is:
What he missed? Because the result is the defeat of a great favorite in each presentation that showed she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been in vain elected Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face Vogue, degrees obtained by Taliana Vargas or queens Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor considered in the decision of the juror to designate First Princess is that it has not convinced with his answer to the question &quot;? What was the book that has marked you and why? Asked by Martín Gómez Murillo, the Carreta Leamos Literaria.
This is the answer of the candidate from Valle to this question:
&quot;I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think it is a form of cultural terms is, I definitely think the book that marked my childhood is&quot; The Little Prince &quot;, a book that&#39;s deep enough.
Now I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is a book of universal literature we should read it all and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called &quot;The ardor of blood. &#39;&quot;
This answer did not please at first because of the term &quot;cultural terms is&quot; and second for not explain specifically how each book mentioned had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe and wise, it happens what should happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is a great book &quot;
Launched between the assumptions that there is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist in Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the standing ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary price (Oster food challenge, the public vote for best costume craft, and Queen Mother), &quot;it roused the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the queen and that&#39;s why she did not shine on stage. &quot;
And we noted that in its first presentation in swimsuit at the beach of Hilton and her two parades on the eve of the coronation.
While the two shows she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she had not the strength and energy representatives of Atlántico and Magdalena.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the &quot;Como en casa&quot; (like home), Canal RCN said that Melina had been designated Princess &quot;confirms that the candidate receiving the most awards during the contest receives not the queen&#39;s crown. &quot;
In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of National Beauty Contest.
This is why two days before the election the juror international Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed regarding social needs of his country.
&quot;But the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, before starting the contest are already involved in projects&quot;, explained it.
It also speculates that Valle sinned by his defects and his behind the fibrosis was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory because the jury specifically elected him as the candidate &#39;Natural Beauty&#39; with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical labor charge.
The preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco queens recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, it was best, &quot;but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, he has left the points on the last day. &quot;
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgeries she had undergone.
&quot;The surgeries are good, but Valle did not know them.
His body has never been his strength and she lost because of this aspect. &quot;
For that price, the National Beauty Contest calls for the first time, after the parade in swimwear has emerged a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo had to Melina for not giving him a taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who despite his dazzling passing by Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
Cali is a dactyloscopist made history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano &#39;.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 1 November dactyloscopist ITC Cali has made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, comparing his fingerprints.
Seven dactyloscopistes working in local offices of CTI, this week it was the turn of &#39;availability&#39; of Eliazar Gonzalez, a man in Puerto Tejada who has worked 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
Early in his career, González has worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place which contained the corpses that were to be identified.
The year 2000 he has been transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking courses adequate, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of skin friction, that is to say palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to take with him Eliazar clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting.
Friday night he went for a helicopter in Cauca Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and had been suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the world&#39;s oldest guerrilla, therefore he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant from the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the prints do not lie.
Galton accompanied by a magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye has not deceived: it was of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, the native of Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme commander of the FARC.
In Search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopist SIJIN of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant.
Many people know not our job.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin of error, which may be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, dactyloscopistes support investigations for offenses such as theft and homicide, and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many offenders have false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and looking in the database.
The researcher was told that in case of theft he had to remove part of a house wall, in this place because the thief had his hand pressed to release a safe full of jewels and money.
&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not adequate area to derive a fingerprint, but in this case we could get the impression the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different flights,&quot; recalls it.
Fingerprints can also confirm or rule out suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man with drink bottles around him.
By the interlude of the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspect of the crime and in fact a mark on the bottle coincided.
While this is no guarantee that he the murderer, it places it on the crime scene.
A dactyloscopist ITC explained that the extracted &quot;fingerprint objects with chemical reagents or physical.&quot;
When they appear, we use a sampler or tape to remove.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database déclinquents, or National Civil Register.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians&quot;, stated the expert from CTI.
He explained that not everything is how it shows in the television program CSI.
Like everything that glitters is not gold, all that we touch becomes not necessarily a footprint.
It can however be used, if one performs the necessary confrontation.
The &quot;outraged&quot; defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters jostled before the Zuccotti place to camp.
A large proportion of individuals accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integral of motion Occupies Wall Street on Tuesday defied the authorities in New York while trying to enter again, thanks to a court order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park from the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters jostled before the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to reach through a court order allowing &#39;outraged&#39; to camp again in this place, while the other&#39;s movement responded to the occupant evacuation park to the north of the city, where there were new cases.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests &quot;said one of the spokesmen of the movement&quot; Occupies Wall Street &quot;, Mark Bray.
Bray has detailed the response of &#39;outraged&#39; at the evacuation of the camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings has issued an order prohibiting the removal forced to place and allowed the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Moreover, the &#39;outraged&#39; occupied a new park at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the figure concrete, ensuring that it Efe saw some journalists who had been handcuffed too.
The organization ensures that there are old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has shifted as a sign of support to members of the movement and tried to intervene on behalf of them before the Police.
Meanwhile, place Zuccotti - which is an enclosure of private property - remains closed until the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which they must analyze the legality of the evacuation this morning.
Some demonstrators were previously displaced and distributed at that time copies of the judiciary and they even delivered to the agents who were monitoring the site, which caused &#39;some small clashes&#39; said Bray, who denounced the fact some officials have beat demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of Wall Street Takes up or apply &#39;laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit access to the demonstrators back to the park with tents or other properties they formerly used. &#39;
Mayor Bloomberg said at a press conference that, because of the judiciary, the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and the protesters, whom he warned however that local laws do not allow s install with tents and sleeping bags.
Councillor personally defended the evacuation conducted at dawn instead Zuccotti, an operation during which they arrested 200 people and which was decided because of the fact that the protesters &#39;violated the law&#39;.
Bloomberg said he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became &quot;a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to hurt to others &quot;because&quot; some stores received threats &quot;and residents were afraid&quot; to their quality of life &quot;.
&quot;The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that deep Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor &quot; does not respect freedom of expression &quot;.
Officials &quot;Occupies Wall Street&quot; have also indicated they do not think of organizing &quot;great deeds&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began Sept. 17.

Next to Anderson and Peters, the special program of Christmas CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is himself not far from the controversies.

Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP up 1.5% thanks to a domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country from Japanese World War II.
The first estimate of Tokyo Government calculated the material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a move that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have lessened.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% a quarter earlier and a 6% annualized rate.
That recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of purchases of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami on.
In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real stimulate the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that prompts use the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, use of zero failures to thrive.
Japan woke up mainly through changes in domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, driven by increased spending on cars, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has delivered to market when the yen - the yen - has become a &quot;safe haven&quot; elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and the United States&#39; forecasts disorders, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country with floating line is determined by the economic health of big technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor performance between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
&quot;We must follow the continuing risks, such as deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of yen,&quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of countries have introduced in September clearer signals of economic downturn.
The indicator anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are curbed.
As it fell 100.4 points to four decimal places, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even with below average, which is in the 100 level, lowering n eight decimal places up 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds the doubts
Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written agreement
With risk premiums triggered devices and reinstalled the uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that leads to the release of the great crisis of European debt.
The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new transitional government is Hellenic rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels as a real conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and the hundred days will be established in his name can be applied for short, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for the date, that of February 19.
&quot;The main task of this Government is that to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October,&quot; said Papadimos yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message emerges Samaras no doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we&#39;re committed to nothing more&quot;.
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse qu&#39;UE and IMF, organizations must unlock the 8000 Athens million with emergency needs, and made clear that he will approve a letter of commitment to achieving adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the will of any referendum Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will unlock if using the new Government and leaders of major parties do not sign Hellenic not &quot;a written undertaking without ambiguities as early as possible.&quot;
The spokesman of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return &quot;soon&quot; in Athens to discuss with the new Government &quot;the elements necessary to pay the sixth installment&quot; of 8,000 million, although there is a definite date either.
The Greeks have much to do.
Queen Sofía: &quot;They are instruments for the progress and hope&quot;
Queen highlights the place &quot;casting&quot; of Spain regarding this type of finance
Spain &quot;has reached a prominent place in the global role of Micro-Finance&quot;.
Queen Sofia said that the country has become in the past two decades the second donor in the world regarding this cooperation instrument whose &quot;essence&quot; lies in the fact that it is &quot;an instrument for progress social justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings &quot;.
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that such operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and &quot;very special, in that which has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below one dollar a day, which is attached the&quot; poverty line &quot;.
Spain &quot;still working&quot; to enlarge the network of beneficiaries &quot;in every corner of the planet, and assumes the task with&quot; responsibility &quot;, reported the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, &quot;ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women&quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have &quot;many purposes&quot; and &quot;we are facing many challenges.&quot;
The Microcredit Summit is viewed not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which we must drive &quot;two basic goals.&quot;
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families who have accessed the financial services and one hundred million of these families out of poverty they live in now .
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world &quot;following the path initiated some years ago a pioneering way&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, said the Queen Sofía as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition &quot;.
And she described the father of the instrument as an &quot;idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, the work which she knows from 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know his field lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;in every meeting I have seen a continuous evolution &quot;said His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term&quot; head of family &quot;meeting in Valladolid from the&quot; fork out the poor. &quot;
Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and finding solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical imperative&quot;
The External Affairs Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic state.
In this sense, it stated that it would be wrong to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a &quot;continuing obligation&quot;.
Jimenez found that microcredit involve &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty,&quot; and now &quot;more than ever&quot; governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow that it is the victim of cutbacks.
For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation&quot;.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;success&quot; to give &quot;confidence&quot; people &quot;which excluded all close the door&quot;, and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, has welcomed the attendees in a city that &quot;opens contaminated the spirit of solidarity&quot;.
The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage European
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, Nov. 14, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel also Chair of Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned but the program has established itself in the fall, especially to meet the activists who consider government policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and can be the Italians tomorrow.
The motion of the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Delegates to 1001, only nine voted against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were treated at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The idea Mistress of the Chancellor - and motion - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe.&quot;
Not only because Europe is peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;
For the Chancellor, &quot;it is time for a breakthrough in Europe.&quot;
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen control of the European Union on fiscal policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of President of the European Commission by universal suffrage &quot;to give a face to Europe&quot;.
Such is certainly one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress which is clearly the inspiration Wolfgang Schäuble.
While it is unlikely that the bloc agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to balance the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which of course came back to reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has not sought to win its conference on the backs of &quot;small&quot; European countries or troubled countries quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of the &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud sick?
After allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 at Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the subject - recurring since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social handouts.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in an environment of rigor, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign right, the majority wants to focus on the sick.
First, the purpose of budget savings: the government intends to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of deficiency before the assumption of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill lose four days of pay, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that could give rise to anger, but that would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: one day impose on staff waiting uncompensated in the event of stoppage of work (they have so far no waiting period, in three days against private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority stimulus also the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
&quot;The controls will be much larger and, in addition, if you&#39;re caught, you will repay,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand micro RTL, Sunday, Nov. 13.
As in other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the actual fraud in the stoppages.
This is indeed the subject since 2002 constantly monitored and offensive policies, which have generally been successful.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
We dwell first on the national figures.
According to the National Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than 237 million daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, per diem in 2008 accounted for 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and workplace accidents, and 54% were for the sick, or 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French were on average 14.5 days off work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group.
This average hides some differences: another study, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any days of sick leave.
Another study, this time of health insurance, says that in 2010, 37% were on sick leave lasting less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% thereafter.
When compared with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not) varied, France, between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28 % in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud is very sick little face in the black.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small scale.
Strengthening of legislation since 2002 that systematic controls are on sick leave over 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 achieved for short stops were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases &quot;inappropriate or unwarranted&quot; about 1.2 million, or 132 000.
A total of 169,000 cases therefore &quot;unjustified&quot;, over millions of employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents little face, for example, that black labor.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9-15000000000 euros of tax shortfall a year, more than the total cost of per diem, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to them.
Papademos: Greece will implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy.
This was said Monday, November 14 Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, in Parliament, adding that one hundred days given to his unity government would be insufficient to accomplish this task.
&quot;To continue the efforts of economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of fiscal adjustment,&quot; said the prime minister, who delivered his first public speech at the opening debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government because the country&#39;s participation in the euro area &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos expected that the country&#39;s public deficit will be reduced &quot;at around 9%&quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 % in 2009.
Denies the right of the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, Monday brought its support to measures already agreed to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not embark on an additional austerity.
&quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures,&quot; he said during a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and the fight against waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
A Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU do not débloqueraient the loan of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee of all parties would support the measures provided Antonio Samaras said that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
We must legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said an expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In palliative care, the committee demanded that governments, institutions, health care, and physicians working together to provide better palliative care, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
Canadian society is living in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree indeed to speak with their doctor the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, attended by six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when a choice, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.
If Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&quot;
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And notwithstanding that capacity for most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the country is in Quebec that this rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&#39;s authors arrive at conclusions that go against the federal government&#39;s position, which has already said he did not want to change the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
But according to experts, who also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, that is to say the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consenting.
On the contrary, said yesterday in a conference call Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, we would find many more cases of these excesses in the very countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow persons at end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll in 2010.
And 66% believe that to legalize euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly and disabled has less value.
As for those who have practiced assisted suicide, those surveyed 41% believe they should not be pursued.
For the maintenance or termination of care from a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors.
Also, the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stipulated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a refusal is not legally valid criminal.
The expert committee also asks that health professionals are trained to comply with a duty to refuse treatment at end of life, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee demanded that governments, institutions, health care, and physicians working together to provide better palliative care, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to sedation or terminal, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when not in use to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of experts signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who have over 18 years could ask what the assisted suicide,&quot; said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted a summary yesterday the report.
Mr. Deschamps also noted that the report&#39;s authors seem to place personal autonomy above all other values ​​involved in the social fabric of society.
But &quot;in society, he said, there are tags and constraints.&quot;
The specialist health law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the conclusions of the report, she called a &quot;clear pro-euthanasia&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, denies in particular the report data regarding the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The Jordanian king calls on President Assad from power
Damascus denounced a &quot;conspiracy&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of President Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the offices of the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressure has intensified yesterday on Syria Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, denounces and resists them a &quot;conspiracy&quot; against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, took position in favor of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;step down&quot; to Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s forces have been killed.
&quot;If Bashar had at heart the interests of his country, he should resign, but should also create conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics,&quot; said the King of Jordan, which borders Syria, in a BBC interview.
For its part, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime will be unsuccessful.
&quot;Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and can not satisfy them leave,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, neighboring countries for which Turkey adopted a line of increasingly hard.
The United States have welcomed their side of a &quot;consensus building against Assad and the actions of the regime&quot; Syria, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the U.S., EU, Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt a tone increasingly hard&quot; against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department State.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime&#39;s forces were killed in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed &quot;in crossfire and shelling with heavy machine guns to Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem has yet held that the country is &quot;heading toward the end of the crisis&quot;.
He also strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend its work of Damascus, which he said was &quot;a dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not waver,&quot; he added, asserting that &quot;the plots against Syria will fail.&quot;
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a &quot;mechanism to protect civilians&quot; and wants to send 500 members of organizations of Arab human rights, media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repressive regime which he believes is locked in the &quot;paranoia&quot;.
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review progress on the implementation of the plan to end the crisis decided on November 2, and including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities experiencing the challenge and release demonstrators arrested.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, held yesterday &quot;incorrect&quot; decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis while refraining from any support sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti markets takes time and sacrifice to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a short time to market his team to form and implement a program, which will contain &quot;sacrifices&quot; to recover lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former Commissioner was in discussions with political parties before yesterday to meet today with unions and employers.
It should establish a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
&quot;Monti spoke of a large program with many sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, member of a small number of parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the prime minister designate.
President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part said he expected that Mario Monti by Friday seeking a confidence vote in Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support .
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti on a short list, probably a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking the time.
In &quot;Democracy, there are specific deadlines&quot; to prepare a government and its program, he said, calling himself &quot;confident that markets will be patient and understand.&quot;
The appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but anxiety took over the top especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister should be appointed a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he stressed he would like to include &quot;political&quot;.
The new government is to last until 2013, when the next legislative, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr. Monti is committed once took office, to work under pressure and in order that Italy &quot;is again the protagonist&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.&quot;
The EU believes that Rome will not meet its balanced budget target in 2013 despite the austerity measures adopted in recent months, including new called austerity measures.
The &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia Italian, who will see Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, &quot;because a country that has no growth can not meet the parameters of deficit.&quot;
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an &quot;epochal change&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconi&quot;, the &quot;teacher&quot; symbolizing &quot;the serious challenge of &quot;and an&quot; other Italy &quot;, according to the editorialists.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of bonds.
A Russian scientist helped Iran&#39;s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator for use with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO that specializes in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA announced last week its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimensions&quot; of Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing largely from documents of the IAEA, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from 60 years in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he would have left the center to establish a company producing &quot;nano-diamonds&quot; in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company might have led to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with Iranian program from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to &quot;strong indications that the development by Iran&quot; a system of nuclear detonation &quot;was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only familiar with this technique, but which, as a Member State has informed the Agency spent most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program in his country of origin &quot;.
The crimes have increased anti-Muslim 50%
The crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence have decreased slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offenses against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes anti-religious.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% driven by differences in race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
&quot;After declining in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes rise again,&quot; said the organization Human Rights First Human rights, &quot;the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant,&quot; added organization in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, and all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; says an official of the organization, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,&quot; he adds, saying it could go through an improvement of police reports on &quot;hate crimes&quot;.
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in U.S. federal law is a legacy from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence due to race, skin color, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, including to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, what makes its service look like a little more than Facebook.
A new tab &quot;activity&quot; and another &quot;name&quot; can track more clearly, live activity of the other &quot;twittos&quot;, we follow users whose posts (&quot;tweets&quot;) and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow the messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have any favorite posts, etc..
This new form of Twitter has been tested &quot;on a small percentage of users in August&quot; before being distributed to all network Monday, told AFP the spokesman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its low operating instinctive, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) to the delight of insiders, opens and to a wider audience with a more comparable to the handling of public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users struggled to blow &quot;tweets&quot; sliced ​​on the value of this innovation.
&quot;It is unnecessary, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @ jemb123.
&quot;The Activity feature will help me to better track certain elements of my Twitter stream,&quot; @ dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
inclusion of a &quot;golden rule&quot; budget in the constitution
The grand coalition government to power in Austria social-démocrate/démocrate-chrétien decided Tuesday to include in the constitution a &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce budget deficits and avoid any deterioration by rating agencies the sovereign rating of Austria (Triple A).
This is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision after a cabinet meeting, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debt of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If the solvency of Austria was lowered only one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,&quot; argued the Vice Chancellor and Minister for Democratic Foreign-Christian, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria This follows a request from the summit in Brussels of member countries of the euro area of ​​26 October: Heads of State and Government had then demanded the inclusion of late 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian government moves closer to the &quot;German model&quot;, Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;.
By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state shall not exceed 0.35 per year % of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities must submit budgets to balance.
The objective is to increase the horizon 2020/21 debt under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threat of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
&quot;We will take action as we did last time if we find excessive volatility&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, Mr Noda said in the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen went back near historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the yen, which had just set a new record since 1945 of force against the greenback.
But the yen has risen steadily since, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
Tuesday the dollar has fallen below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of products made in Japan and reduced the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild&quot; since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Mr. Noda said that fears that the rise in the yen does not kill the egg in the fragile recovery.
The third largest economy has resumed growth in the third quarter by -1.5% over the previous quarter, for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumer spending weighed down by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister held that the high price of the yen did not reflect &quot;the economic fundamentals of Japan&quot;.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for his part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, implying that no additional monetary easing could be expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the central bank has increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion) purchases of treasury bills, increasing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) on maximum amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro area:
rates go up, stock markets flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rate of fragile countries continue to climb.
Always worried about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little more into negative territory on Tuesday November 15.
In Paris, at 10 am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt and London yield 0.4% 0.1%.
&quot;With the new pressure on bond yields of states of the Eurozone in crisis, stock markets around the world continue to give back some of their recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, with turn of renewed fears of market participants about the ability of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor changes as investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concerns about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro is moving at its lowest level in six weeks.
Around 10 am, the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollars, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, in joint session on Monday passed a motion including a possibility for a country struggling to emerge from the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain disturbingly high levels.
Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yields reached 10-year 6.85%, the Spanish securities of similar maturity 6.2%.
These pressures on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti called time to restore the market situation in Italy, in danger of suffocation from the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Papademos, it affirmed that the implementation of decisions taken at the summit of the euro area on October 27 would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain finds himself in the crosshairs of markets, while Sunday held parliamentary elections in the country.
The interest rate differential (&quot;spread&quot;) between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
Pending growth figures in the euro area
Statistical side, France has experienced economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised downward the number of the second quarter with a decline of 0.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, this is truly the fourth most worries economists.
Germany, meanwhile, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has to guard against the risk of another recession.
Energy Policy:
the facts should prevail over dogma
If it is a subject that can not be treated from short-term considerations or under the &quot;emotion is good energy policy.
The availability and cost of &quot;electricity directly affect the purchasing power and business competitiveness.
It is a healthy electoral appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the importance they attach to the nuclear.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental options.
The French must base their opinions on objective facts, data rational.
While we are 7 billion &quot;human beings on the planet, the&quot; demographic change will result in a doubling of demand &quot;electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a large part of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will offset the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce &quot;permanent electricity, not to mention the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the fight against climate change, a subject disappeared the environmental debate.
The accident at Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear.
This is not the case of Belgium, who submits his to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing, or Switzerland, which just means that no longer build new generation plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few , continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they have decided after Fukushima to add one to their fleet by taking over the construction of a power cut after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the rising price of &quot;electricity, energy dependency aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas plants and coal.
Within months, all these untoward effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
European champion in the &quot;wind, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind, on what basis, emissions CO2 and the price of electricity are respectively 65% ​​and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a bill &quot;electricity 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a global economy the cost of &quot;energy is a key factor in competitiveness and guarantee the maintenance of industrial facilities in the national territory, French companies benefit from the&quot; cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would generate a spike in the price of &quot;electricity, which would render illusory the rhetoric of re-industrialization of our country and defend the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any principled opposition to this energy, the polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has built an industrial network of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
High export, it leads a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative job can not be relocated.
If France were to agree to phase out nuclear power, would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing to a trickle the 6 billion of annual exports of French &quot;nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would command a PRT designed to work sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the &quot;energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production&quot; miracle power, nor does it exist diabolical.
Development by Areva of low-CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewable, reflects the complementary sources of &quot;energy.
For nuclear, maintain the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a safety authority that has control uncompromising and transparent as existing plants on the Flamanville.
Our team, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Single, Three Mile Island occurred under conditions of normal operation, it has had no significant environmental or human.
At Chernobyl, the reactor design and human unforgivable sins have caused the tragedy.
A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
Result of this approach and cooperation between regulators, operators and builders French and German, the EPR has a design making it capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who wish to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to competitors Areva and EDF in their opening the way to seize the leadership in The best of nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the &quot;emotion, dogma and maneuvers dominate partisan debate as crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a one-time or opportunity for the economy?
Policy on immigration conducted by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles-congestion of police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy number, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &quot;countries of human rights &quot;France.
More recently, the administrative harassment which are the subject of international students has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (see Libération, 23 May) proclaiming the way that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waiters. &quot;
But it is rarely analyzed in economic terms.
It is there on this subject a fairly broad consensus between left and right.
Right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers&quot;, and left, explaining that by Michel Rocard of France &quot; can not accommodate all the misery of the world &quot;in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers were divided left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we deign to grant vis-à-vis immigrants.
In its program, Francois Hollande is confined to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our &quot;migration problem&quot;.
This idea of ​​immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps pay electorally, but it is economically very costly.
As recalled by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizes the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.). There is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restrict immigration anemia affects growth and employment.
Fears vis-à-vis the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace the native workers, especially low-skilled, exerting downward pressure on wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers, performing essentially trades shortages in sectors of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in industries that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow employment opportunities.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country that has a shortage of anesthetists, the complementarities between national and migrant are that arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals .
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages over time.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants among the naturalized American Nobel Prize, Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years provide a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of € 150,000 to government budget averaged over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy would, at the start of term, get the missing points of growth &quot;with teeth&quot;.
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, is to think of European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, it is also a very fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented in Athens there are over two thousand years, has experienced throughout the twentieth century tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have thought he would, for democracy to triumph permanently of his enemies, to exercise the vote, and exercise the most direct way possible.
We have known since Napoleon &quot;the Little,&quot; that this was an easy mind.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as the philosopher once said Etienne Vacherot Republican.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, an education, the Enlightenment, of economic solidarity and social justice.
The crisis of Europe we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally and primarily a crisis of politics and democracy.
The recantation of true-false referendum Greek will have had in this regard revealing double value: that of the need for a return of political power, but also the unsettling feeling of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle to move today, and that for many of them, Republican soldiers no longer pull in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums, held at the discretion of the necessities and piecemeal.
A blank check or a European absolute monarch jump feet first into the empty nationalist withdrawal: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to exercise but cleavers, common, of right, continuous and serene, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we indeed can not stop where most &quot;list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
This is the whole of Europe that folds to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, who suffers from impotence and its lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage.
There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but the whole of Europe slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the sovereignty of the people steering the European project.
Because together, the Europeans will reduce the weight of their debts to free up markets and prepare the future by investing.
The crisis will involve decisions at European level that can not be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course lead us to disaster.
Having long fought the proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, now everybody wants the European economic government.
Be.
But think without political integration and more democratic, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new craze and a new deadlock.
We must take a new step in European construction.
To the Republic in France, it took &quot;to&quot; Republican.
The Revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson is still valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To Europe, Europeans do.
Smart cards &quot;contactless&quot; generalize
The living world of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate optimist.
The year 2011 looks set to end on a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (credit card, phone with SIM card ...), more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The fastest-growing segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay public transport or pay for purchases simply by approaching the card reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, against 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the overall market for smart cards (6,925,000 cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 POS terminals accept.
In France, the beginnings were modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But supermarkets are working extra hard.
Carrefour has issued this year and 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards Pass.
To move up a gear, it is necessary that banks now equip their customers.
&quot;Two big French institutions are committed to the future to systematically disseminate to their customers credit cards equipped for contactless,&quot; Gerard announced Nébouy, Visa Europe CEO France.
The banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) necessary to complete transactions.
&quot;They have fallen behind.&quot;
&quot;But they should finally see a boom next year.&quot;
&quot;We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,&quot; said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are taking the lead.
Credit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next at Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a holster allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday preparing to market an offering that allows customers to pay with their mobile contactless.
Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected of longstanding ties between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now &quot;is satisfied&quot;.
&quot;The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,&quot; he said without elaborating.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French nationals in Niger in January would have uncovered walkways.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM, Anthony and Vincent Delory Léocour should be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had found several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis directs calls made to several parties based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, home of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says close of AQIM and the sect.
&quot;This is an advanced but it should probably wait for evidence before speaking more formal operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram&quot;.
&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;
&quot;We know for years that the sect has financial backing and intellectuals outside and she shows more and more active,&quot; Kunle Amuwo tempers, a Nigerian scientist.
In recent months these &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the evolution of speech and Boko Haram or its procedures, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and same bill as those used by AQIM.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since lobbied for Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group as a community of enlightened bit of interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association a rapid success.
She became politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while his supporters agree the fight against the central government impious.
The purpose of these first churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, activists of Boko Haram are particularly active, multiplying the attacks against police stations.
Abuja is the reaction, as usual, without nuance.
The army is back in town, there were 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, stopped living, is killed in prison.
Hence the sect will be radicalized and leave its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she claims that an attack is 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police headquarters secured in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local UN headquarters will be his first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa who would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through the Nigeria worries now all security specialists.
While AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, as Somali al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready &quot;to share all information.&quot;
The World According to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and rival of simplicity and ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can she handle a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other multiply thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - fuse.
Mitt Romney, the best position in the race for the nomination of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, has threatened to take the Chinese at the WTO and put into question &quot;for manipulating their currency,&quot; a central theme in an exasperated American by migration of large segments of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if this means triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China and Obama&#39;s only candidate to have a vision of foreign policy sophistication, almost choked against an attitude that &quot;flatter&quot; emotions.
He called for a constructive dialogue with Beijing but muscular (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which stagnates in the deep surveys, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he brags.&quot;
&quot;If Obama is elected, they will bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations vis-à-vis the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows a disregard for his embarrassing record.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;is trying to develop a nuclear capability&quot; - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants of strikes against Iran, says he is ready, in turn, to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents counter that the current President Reagan also had simple ideas and he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he had to put water in his wine Anti-Terrorism.
They insist, rightly, on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, his departure too precipitous &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his dithering on Libya, and a sticky label him as weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The people judge rather positive assessment of Obama&#39;s national security, which eliminated Bin Laden.
From Iraq, she is wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, arguing that we must rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The Nord Stream, new door NTRY of Russian gas to Europe
Nord Stream, directly linking Western Europe to Russia via the Baltic seabed, entered service.
It must deliver gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
Over 500 guests including four heads of state and government attended last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and buffet end, the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects, under the sea Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte the wheel turned all the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas in the Western European network .
With the new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each additional year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed in late 2012, allowing delivery of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And we already mentioned the possibility of constructing a third over the same course.
For Gazprom, the completion in a timely fashion of this massive project feels like a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltics.
Nord Stream will indeed help deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, both countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new Hitler-Stalin Pact,&quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
This means if the subject is politically sensitive.
The Western Europe, by providing support to the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But what is the price of a weakening of Europe&#39;s energy, since the project has created a rift between East Europeans and West.
Russia has, in just five years, the triumph of his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
&quot;This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, he is a new artery that binds us together organically,&quot; Fillon confirmed by opening the pipeline, demonstrating how large gas contracts are also political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in large numbers to Lubmin, the point of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The tube is underwater steel-wrapped concrete to protect against the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, he had to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
&quot;A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
He also took more measures to protect flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupts its entire length: no valve or station maintenance.
A platform was laid off control of Sweden, but the project gave it up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company to settle permanently off their coasts.
&quot;In case of damage, we stop the flow of gas in less than a minute,&quot; said Jens Müller.
If a leak, the gas in the pipeline then escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who provided the welds to find a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring the status of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, towed by a ship, for external observation, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
Of the form of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to work fifty years without suffering any repair.
The gas flow is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bar at the start, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces for this project.
Gazprom remains the leader, who keeps 51% of shares.
There are attached the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased to this company for twenty years renewable, the total transport capacity of gas.
&quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,&quot; said Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was assured by the shareholders 30% and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment totaled 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to recover their costs, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline with pine trees.
Valve, 4.5 meters high, form the exit gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and specific gas happens, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a book mark.
In existence for fifteen years by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the interest in writing.
It has a scent of adventure, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its rectangular black cover, its elastic, the leaves of a white color, as weathered by time.
Yet the Moleskine as we know it today was born ... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, at the time decided to launch a notebook design but Distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The book draws on an ancient technique of production, mole skin (moleskin) which means a coating used to cover cotton benches for example.
This type of book was very popular with writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has revived one day be old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, now the Brand Manager at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased 26% to $ 12.7 million pieces passed.
We are far from the production of confidential early years, when only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to draw a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook perfect for both the businessman that students and professionals.
Like the Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception in today has nearly 100 since 2008 and has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, the Fnac small shops downtown and proved his identity.
&quot;We followed the times and this new requirement of writing, despite the rise of e-mails,&quot; said Maria Sebregondi.
This signature accompanies the development of cultural Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibit &quot;Detour&quot; where architects and artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also initiated coverage Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of his success and the cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer covers ... The brand is available on a variety of media.
A success that is the envy: the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, Syntegra Capital today, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of disabled workers is he so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy implementation in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still two times higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
&quot;No, said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of disabled.&quot;
&quot;The progress made over the last fifteen years are considerable.&quot;
&quot;At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times.&quot;
&quot;There still remains much to do.&quot;
I must say that for unemployed disabled people, many obstacles remain before accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% did not and the tray of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
In short, many criteria that complication in the re-employment, and that &quot;the crux of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
So much for the brakes objectives.
Remains unsaid, changing attitudes, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Enterprise for the City indicated that the managers surveyed have &quot;a low level of knowledge of disability&quot;, with &quot;over-representation of persons in wheelchairs, impaired mental or intellectual.&quot;
Result, private companies over 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law ... In 1987.
The latest available figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;We are now around 3%,&quot; said Peter White, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from businesses that do not respect this law.
Proof: the number of establishments &quot;taxed&quot;, as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies, says Peter White.&quot;
&quot;But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, especially in large groups.&quot;
According to the ministry of employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, against 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: &quot;What happiness&quot;
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (8:45 p.m.) and Eden Hazard Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they get from this friendly match.
We will not write up that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the auditorium at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard has indeed made peace.
Five months after the procedure mood striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but good things to say about it.
&quot;I feel much happier Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to move forward,&quot; says his side Lille.
As for its services has contrasting between club and country, &quot;this is a whole, is it justified.&quot;
&quot;In Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot;
&quot;I must take my bearings.&quot;
Struck against Romania on Friday night for the match against France, Hazard comes to St. Denis finally &quot;shine&quot;.
Not to mention, however, the notion of &quot;pleasure&quot;.
The Blues, he encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I was always endure,&quot; he says.
Inevitably, this helps further strengthen the character &quot;particularly&quot; the meeting.
Especially that face, &quot;there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),&quot; he recalls.
&quot;It has crossed just now.&quot;
&quot;Being able to play against them, this is happiness!&quot;
Good-naturedly, Leekens for his part spoke of &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; to play &quot;an exhibition match.&quot;
&quot;Pride&quot; also shows, as a &quot;neighbor&quot; - that France is &quot;once again a team of high level&quot; a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
&quot;Laurent Blanc did a great job of thunder,&quot; he was thrilled.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be willing to share the plane with the Blues management ... Brazil in 2014.
&quot;Our little Belgians get big,&quot; he said.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to build something, players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot;
&quot;You will report back at the next games.&quot; Included one against France.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal&#39;s Paulo Bento began with great optimism the playoff against Bosnia (2200), in Lisbon on Tuesday.
On the way, both teams had been unrealistic.
&quot;At the end of 90 minutes, a team we will be happy and, above all, a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento sees already, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecção, which is at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debunk.
Given the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears obvious that games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, certainly, but he was unable to score that goal so precious, that would have relieved.
&quot;This is a good result, which has nevertheless a certain risk because we did not score away goal&quot;
But at home, in their bright Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese were convinced to move to an audience that should be there too hot, even if the party looks obviously &quot;very close&quot;, says an optimistic Bento but lucid .
&quot;We expect a close game, but we are quite convinced that they can take over,&quot; said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
&quot;We continue to have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,&quot; even when relativized&#39;s successor Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday the Portuguese forces in Bosnia to score and win.
A draw may be enough to Bosnians, who also need to score.
&quot;This is a good result, which has nevertheless a certain risk because we did not score away goal,&quot; laments Bento.
&quot;We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has a lot of players with individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese have the intention to input a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not give them time to think.&quot;
A good idea, provided to be realistic this time.
