Schneemangel bedeviled on the mountains hotel owners
Scneelose pisten sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of snow frightens the people of appointment of the skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in riesengebirge still free room for all wintertermine incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited often.
The people's offers to go by, raise the prices, but in the meantime, they fear to order mandatory.
And if you call us immediately, questions whether, in our view, this year's Christmas in snow or "on Matsch" will be, led the operators of the informationsportals spindl.info, Martin jandura.
Who the silvester-aufenthalt in the spindelmühle just after his ideas like that should no longer with the appointment hesitate.
Anyone who prefers to save money and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait another few days.
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer now offer for the silvestertag predominantly only wochenaufenthalte.
I think that they are still for a while will seek to sell it, but then we also have to give in them, and in a shorter time.
And then the free rooms jandura, fading quickly.
Free beds to all winterterminen always provides ongoing ingtours a travel agent in vrchlabi.
Now, we are most interested in the weihnachtswoche, now is not to be sold out.
In our program is about half of the seats are still free.
Therefore we have quite a few cheaper weihnachtsaufenthalte preparing for the last moment, the director of the travel agencies, Petr Schiefert ingtours.
The silvestertag in riesengebirge can the vrchlabi-reisebüro also offer yet, but there is much less of free seats.
Good cakes also the first 14 days in February, the rest will be sold wintertermine, on average.
This year is the interest in the another negative influence on winteraufenthalte in riesengebirge is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
No one wants this the end of the year in the mountains with snow.
Should the pisten be verschneit within a week will also be the Christmas that means Schiefert be sold out.
Vice versa and somewhat better than in last year to manage the room in the hotel to occupy snezkou pecpod horizons.
We are around five per cent better than in the previous year.
On silvestertag and Christmas, we have only a few open Zimmer.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in janua and in February will be the business going well enough too, informed the Director of the best pec-hotels, Karel Rada.
To 80 per cent for the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel Omnia in zentralparkplatz in janske Lazne occupied.
Remains on Christmas in the latest hotel in janske Lazne even half the beds free.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we are currently about 60 per cent already are filled.
A little weaker is now the February, but in the moment, if the snow comes, will also increase the interest in the aufenthalten in riesengebirge, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik sporysch.
To a greater schneebescherung riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer are waiting in the meantime.
On Thursday it should cool things down and if there is rain, this should be snow on the mountains.
But then again come to a warming informed Jiri jakubsky from the location of the Czech wetteramtes in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of the wisdom
It is almost comic, with what schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor repeatedly in the issue, which he himself for the stupid.
When he finally, afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte its gaze longingly awaited, it was that he is taking this on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years.
Not only that he does several times in the text itself, the saying goes, "just as in Iraq", he has even the name of the Bush- declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "New vorwärtsweg" without hesitation.
In fact he's bush-idee three years - fresh troop contributions in Iraq troubled by the civil war - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months, but that the recommendations of the military, the only possible and the lands that were very successful, that we in the news about Iraq today, not at all.
The reputation of Bush's was that not has improved, his successor because objective, he has a much dankbarere prospects hintergelassen, as could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, hopes Barack Obama, that the miracle repeatedly.
At increase the contingent charged with keeping him again have asked the military, particularly the oberkommandeur the afghanistan-operation General Stanley mccristal, even in spite of the subordinationsgewohnheiten the zaudernden protect severely criticised in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers, about the situation for the better able to reverse.
The president was reluctant three months, but with no better idea came, and so has he the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers betrayed.
From Europe, he has made the promise of another 5,000, even if he were originally bureaucrats of at least 10,000.
Highly problematic for the whole obama-strategie is his project, the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months ago to withdraw the process, and conclude within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure will bring in Iraq.
Even despite the bruderkrieg of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft relatively well structured, their leaders honour of the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation, it can rely on no one and no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their minds.
The political institutions, even if they were not established formally correct, that leaves only scheinbauten, behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen further out to make.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of a lack of transparency of the proportions of the Pakistan- and iran-einflüsse even more complex.
Even the builders of a "strong state," which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation is, is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the obama-strategie am surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only in continues to deteriorate and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the young soldiers, who in the war cries from on the "frühheimkehr 'has already broken out, there is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul who are not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view, the datumssetzung for the troop withdrawal sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban have it as the indirect confession to the American defeat.
The last NATO summit, revealed that the willingness of the Europeans in the combat in Afghanistan are to take part, is running out.
Europe's politicians to their voters cannot, and do not explain the way in which the security of Germany and Italy, with the war in hindukusch-gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that may influence the situation radically, development of the events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate, and the increased sanctions on the Iranians not to work, for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
That question should be answered in the period in which America after Obama for siegerabzug from Afghanistan moves on.
Any solution will, but also a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only hot packs for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left before the presidential election, and so there is still enough time, so that it can be applied to a different strategy in fallls those are totalausfall, would prove to be.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more in cash
The senior leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs in this year received no prämienboni more in cash.
The company announced that the way to the fierce criticism of its lohnpraktiken responded.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern instead of the money receives equities, but they can sell only in five years.
Moreover, the shares can the managers in the case would be taken away, if they are too risky.
Goldman Sachs is so in accordance with the agency Reuters at the top of the effort, the prämieboni Wall Street to combine with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street about the long-term direction is aware of in which she has to go, the former bankers of the Society, Douglas Elliott, Wells said.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the targets of the criticism, after it for the first three quarters of this year to almost 17 billion dollars prämienboni had put aside.
The overall size of the prämienboni in the course of this Jahra, according to the agency Reuters likely displayed measure despite the $20 billion today.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends, the bonuses of the bankers, which one-off £25 excess with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.

The only fachkategorie, no woman in this year, received a Nobel Prize, was physics.
This price is now the scientists Charles Kao for his research in the glasfasern-bereich and George Smith together with Willard boyl for the ccd-chip-erfindung, which is the basis of all digitalkammeras, faxgeräte or astronomical fernrohre is.
Each of the laureates, the diploma, the nobelmedaile and certificate on the purchase of the geldpreises.

Traditionally, the US president, Barak Obama, the most anticipated friedennobelpreis already received this afternoon in Oslo.
He has, in his speech the kontrovere his appointment acknowledged, because it is only the beginning of his journey, and, moreover, is in the forefront of the country, the two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In defence of his policies, he added however, that wars in certain situations on the ability of the global peace is necessary, even if the price is high.

It was accepted that the budget, and perhaps also with Janota's left the Cabinet in the themes of the freitagstreffens will be.

The government has objected to the proposals of social democracy, the budget deficit increase disguises.
Between the Left party, on the one hand, and of the government, Mr Klaus and rechtspartei, on the other hand, is a severe domestic political dispute has arisen because of the question marks over the other work of the fischer-beamtenkabinetts, on whose design the ODS and CSSD and the Green Party have agreed to in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by the parliament, the package of austerity measures, virtually wiped out by the fischer- government in autumn been enforced, and that according to their understanding of government debt.
Klaus, of the law on the state reacts can sign it, but not today, said the diskussionsfrühstück with entrepreneurs that the politicians the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances that have been long time.
In his opinion, there is not a good solution more.
The improvement could only a strong government to bring to a broader consensus among the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende, Mirek Topolanek, has led to terrible that the budget is the government and weigh their continued existence.
The ods-stellvorsitzende, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD and ODS and grünenpartei clearly not working any more.
Premier fishermen in the drafting similar words, described as a "major worry".
The cssd-chef, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the topolanek-worte that the etatdefizit horrifying is that the former government of Topolanek for this year had prepared, and the 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday rated CSSD the approval of staatsbudgets for the next year as success.
Also the people's party was happy.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new movie "Invictus: the ungeschlagene" in the world shows that much of the country from its fight and win despite some criticisms that role was filled by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, rassenverhältnissen and on Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is, in his personal history of the American oscar-schauspieler, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he did of the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could represent him in the Eastwood- film.
Another important role little Damon.
I said to him: "If I was going to play, I have to take them.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, of the price for his role in the eastwood-drama from the boxbereich "Million Dollar Baby" had received was already the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, which has been done by slave owners, finally, to a fictional usa-präsidenten, and even God in "Evan omnipotent", but rarely as someone who is still alive, and for many people that is as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was for his active work to end the apartheid in the South African republic of 27 years in prison.
He was in 1990 to undfür set free four years, he has been president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen," and at the same time it is the name of a gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which has been published in 1875.
The requirement was to talk, as he
Bemoaning the film a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain, Francois Pienaar, the South African rugbyteams zusammenschloss to the country. The new President Mandela knows that its people will following apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically, remains divided.
He believes that his people can agree by the sport, so he decides, one of the world rugbyspieler who are outsiders to some.
Finally, the South African team is growing up in the world of 1995.
Freeman worked in several years, at the kinoleinwand mandela-geschichte.
It had no objective other than to play that role at this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course, so to speak, as he does.
The actors said that if he and the leaders in the same country would be, he would try to meet with Mandela to evening with him to eat and before his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him, to shake Mandela.
I have noticed that when I give you the hand schüttele, I am pleased to transfer their energy, it will, and I had the sense that I know what they are feeling, he said.
It is important to me, to have become a different person.
Little Damon is in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the National rugbyteams, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he six months had time for his role in the harsh rugbywelt.
For him it was a big surprise, Pienaar for the first time when he was in his house.
I remember, when I the türklingel rang that he opened up and the first thing I have in my life to François Pienaar, said was: 'in the film, I see a lot more'.
Despite the apparent differences in the stature of the actors compared with their actual role models, he was led by the director Eastwood, "Invictus: ungeschlagen" positive reviews, and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The filmkritiker of the writer Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the filmrezensionen on the web-seiten rottentomatoes.com, has received Invictus 76 percent positive assessments.
Lichtgeheimnis on Norway disbanded, the Russians have tested a missile
On Norway was a special lichteffekt unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry, yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The start, however, was not successful and the type "of the Bulava missile," originally the pride of the Russian army should be, is slowly to the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Taoiseach, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Launched Bulava is, in most cases, do not have been damaged, or in the air.
In the Russian newspapers writes one already on "Bulava" as on a 'rocket, which is not flies. "
A rocket, which is not flies, but
This has already been 13 attempt, passed at the start of normal.
Until the end of the flight, in turn, occurred technical damage done to the rocket.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third raketenstufe.
But this time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry donskij, which under the water of the White Sea was driving.
This raketentyp enables firing from the submarine.
That is why it is probably that the through an unspecified fliegendes object causing mysterious light on nordwegen indeed the damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals diesesmal has not against it and claimed that it was not able to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were out from and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, regardless of the engines in the first stage damaged.
Even if no teststart without mistake, the leadership of the Defense Department holds just six of 13 for unsuccessful.
Of the nearly fünfzigprozentige success that met the generals with optimism and so will continue to claims that the "Bulava" even without problems will fly and even to ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a gesamtgewicht of Max. 1.15 tonnes will bear.
The legendary Fetisov, with 51 years with the CSKA Moscow a jahresvertrag signed
The legendary abwehrspieler vjaceslav Fetisov arises again, with 51 years in a profi-eishockeyspiel.
The former world champion, Olympic and Stanley Cup -inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the distress, and is probably already in the freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, of his career with forty years ago, in 1998, has been completed, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis kuljas injured, we urgently need a further abwehrspieler.
Fetisov has regularly supported and trained that he will support the team.
We need just some rest of formalities, cited the agency to clarify AP the coach of the moskauclubs of Sergei nemcinov.
It is now not clear whether the comeback of the famous eishockeyspielers only affect a game.
I think that Fetisov of this is to raise the morale of other players, led players nemcinov.

Hyundai, the trade unions will be all the overtime lifted after.
The board of the nosovice-automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the Association on the abolition of all the overtime.
Because often angeordneter overtime, the union announced on Monday the streikbereitschaft.
That reinforced the spokesman for the automobilfabrik Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The board wants to be yet but with the trade unions in this week on a samstagsschicht.
We must not abandon our fertigungsplan, is a principle that was therefore on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime from the bottom proposed that two arbeitsschichten would be worked Vanek said.

In addition, all staff of the samstagsschicht pay their fares and lunch.
With regard to the fact that the amount of overtime the most urgent, and most burning issue on demands and complaints of trade unionists were, the previous week, the production had stopped yesterday afternoon, the board with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, led decided vaněk.

Czech discovery: a substance, which also works with ´ gestählten ´ HIV viruses
The team from the Czech and German scientists for new ties, testing the spread of HIV viruses in the body to prevent.
The main benefit of improved substance is that he is also to the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact pervades, against the disadvantage that the connection to normal virus-varianten not so much, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS could not be cured.
The patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life in length and the proliferation of the HIV viruses from the body.
Their use, but of a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of virus-vermehrung also has the development. Resistentviren SG, against the no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts of three colleges of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the vscht (chemisch-technologische seminary) Prague and of the university in Heidelberg opens the way, how one can argue with the virus-resistenz.
They have proven that the substances known as metalokarborane on the eiweißstoff, the on proliferation of hiv-viruses is responsible.
The metalokarborane are links of Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds, the virus-vermehrung in a different way than all of medicines used today, therefore you can overcome the resistenz-problem.
In their work, the scientists come to New ´ improved ´ links on the basis of the knowledge of the molekularmechanismus of their ties to the viren-eiweißstoff been prepared.
The metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from bor-, hydrogen technology and kohlenstoff-atomen existence and through a metall-atom, in this case cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and maintainable virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the need caused by the hiv-protease hiv-virus-spaltung infektionsvirenpartikel would cause no tyres.
If we eliminate hiv-protease we also the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the researchers explain in the news report, by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR has been issued.
In the work, which in the wissenschaftszeitung Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, was published describing the scientists whole ranks of the compounds, in which two couples of the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, which then will go on unchanged systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The effect of this number of substances on the hiv-protease wurdne in Mark tested, her constant (resistant) variants for HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalokarborane to the usual enzym-variante is not as strong, as in the clinical use of drugs, lost it, but not their effect on the resistentvarianten, against the use of drugs are often ineffective.
The unique wirkungsmechanismus and its other properties, like the biological and chemical stability, low, were aware and possibility of further chemical lie, makes the metalokarboranen too interesting links for further to the development of effective medicines to combat HIV attacks research, says Pavlina rezacova, head of the Laboratory for strukturbiologie of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went on Fischer Los, the literalist
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, said the approved budget for the next year as "horrifying" and the government of Prime Minister by Jan Fischer, in his view, should consider their continued existence.
The expression of the ODS, called the prime minister as a "major worry".
It is supposedly time for the analysis.
The deputy ods-vorsitzende, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the beamtenkabinetts with the support of the CSSD and ODS and grünenpartei clearly not working any more.
After Necas, the prime minister decide whether he intends to be on the minority in the parliament, if it is to support the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order for him to remain in office through the parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to dissent Necas out.
On Wednesday, parliament has the budget for the year 2010, to adopted, however, with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
The parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of the social services and direct payments to the farmers.
The government has objected to the proposals from the Social Democrats, the budget deficit increase disguises.
The Czech Republic, with a lag of 163 billion kronor economies.
The ODS, has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, and also complied with the revised budget is just a less bad variant of the budgetprovisoriums Frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota, has on his disappointment and a feeling of futility, while Premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government's views on the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota serious about his resignation to the case had threatened that the abänderungsvorschläge were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the regierungsgeschäft registered with the prime minister.
It has, he indicated that he also would remain in office to be considered.
Reason to do so is his disappointment at the verhandugn of the budget.
What extent Fischer for the subsequent clash with the budget-defizit have Necas, according to the nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget, had forced the government to do nothing.
The premier also should make it clear that he will resign if parliament will continue to adopt defizit-steigernde laws, for example, the sickness pay and pensions or the dienstgesetzesnovelle deal with.
Topolanek, the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
This is a matter for the prime minister, Fischer and the entire government.
The through the ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, said Topolanek in a textmeldung from the United States.
It has mentioned that in a number of ministries in the deputy post people to sit on top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decides in favour, on the fight against the defizit-höhe of the public finances, "it is completely logical and correct that he is on the linksmehrheit is based, the Today in Parliament".
He then allegedly with the support or tolerance of the civil Democratic party will not be able to count.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be a live, then I am going to deal with that, said the of the civil Democratic party nominee Defense Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in parliament.
Premier Fischer was flying afternoon the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS, at the request of the prime minister, backwards
Necas said that the ODS probably on Wednesday in the parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier members of the civil Democratic party explicitly ask for it because they allow the adoption of the budget.
We come to us not as orphans, we are not small children, as he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the party leader in the parliament and in the Czech Republic have not been eliminated.
I have not noticed that my voice would be lacking.
Even when I gave up on the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially about bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction anything positive would go reacted Topolanek itself.
After the new roadmap for the CD (Czech railways) will be fewer trains travel for roughly the same fahrpreis.
The Czech railways from 13 December, closed or scaled some of the less will be closing its schnell- and lokalzüge, other connections are more opposed.
The entire verkehrsumfang was suspended from the gültigkeitstag of the new roadmap compared with today at two per cent.
The majority of fares incl. Basic and kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several verbindungsmöglichkeiten received in the Capital for example, the residents of ostrava-gebiets, the railways, for this stretch features of the type Pendolino.
By express train is no longer at the after Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less schnellzüge will also focus on the stretch Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle, the direct connections to drive from Prague after letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction does the railways in the county of Hradec Kralove (königsgraz), a total of about eight percent, on a rise can be pleased about it Prague and surroundings.
Two nachtzüge also be lifted on the stretch Prague - Tabor, Budweis, and on some days in the week, the operation of some schnellzüge on the stretch Prague - Pisek - Budweis reduced.
One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new direktverkehrsweges from milovice after Prague, for now, the inhabitants of milovice switch nad Labem in Lysa.
It is the 15th route of the vorortverkehrsystems Esko, whose opening thanks to the eisenbahnelektrifizierung from Lysa nad Labem after milovice is possible.
The fernlangstrecken in the capital will be in the zielstation Prague - Hauptbahnhof end.
The CD SC more lines of leading Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after sumperk / Jesenik, in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino can the passengers since 13 December, are no longer after Bratislava.
Year's bill for regionaleisenbahn: increase of 200 million
The schnellzüge ordered and paid for are from the Ministry receives it, as a whole, the railways to the settlement of the so-called liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion kronor, genaus as in this year.

The owner of student agency, collects, Radim jancura today libel complaint against three sozial-demokratische leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district südmähren, Radko Martinek from the District Pardubice and the head of the region, Martin tesarik Olomouc.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen inteview on radiojournal.
The complaint has to do with the effort of the company, the regionalzugverkehr to engage in some districts.
All regions, but will have the long-term contracts signed with the Czech railways.
All three head attack us and say that we, we have cherry-picking the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we expensive than the Czech railways are, because we make the prices of the Czech Railways would know, the last week has been completed.
So, we have no choice but to us to fight back.
Because of this slander of the society student agency, said jancura the radiojournal.
At the same time he gave was that he evidence from all districts, that their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.

Vaccination against pneumokokken freely and voluntarily
Change imfung against pneumokokken from January the usual.
It is a first for the families be free and voluntary.
But as of now, is up voting for the pflicht-impfung would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination culminate against pneumokokken.
The arzneiinstitut already set the maximum price of vaccines that the health care providers have to pay.
The experts are also on the impfungsverfahren in the clear.
New vaccine
Vaccines free of charge for august-kinder
From January children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken charge on 2 August last year and, later, were born.
The condition St that you do not yet have received impfdosis.
Anyone who has been with the vaccine in the last year or earlier weiterewiederholungsimpfung began, must also pay for themselves.
The first impfdosis, between 3 and 5 lebensmonat of the child will be given.
Already last year a quarter of the families against pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
On the whole, the experts that the health insurance programs for the quantities 300,000 to 450, 000 kroner per year.
You save, but on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all flächenimpfungen the children spent around 500,000 per year.
The pflicht-impfung with the so-called janota-paket was introduced.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen of us die in hospitals, according to investigation per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the pflicht-impfung of the children against pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination duty be?
At the same time it is said that, in future, this vaccine could be mandatory.
From January this by insurance paid for and be voluntary.
That the pflicht-impfung would be better, for instance, mentioned the head of the bürgervereinigung nahlas, kalovsky Rudolf.
His organisation has been touted pneumokokken-impfung in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, to which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite the ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we succeeded, at least that.
I believe that this is the road that we have to go now, kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health wants but the impfverfahren against pneumokokken not change.
In this moment, we are not at all, said his Vlastimil sesen spokesman.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft of practical kinderärzten, Hana cabrnochova, agrees that there is a voluntary vaccination their disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could then be on the reduction of the wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been launched as voluntary," says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of the parents their infants against pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against pneumokokken is also a breakthrough that this than first flächenimpfung of the health insurance paid for and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, for save for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
So that is a concern of the practical kinderärzte that the purchase of the vaccines.
After the original plans should the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies and doctors in the same way they are received by the state, as well as other vaccines issued to you.
Some members, however, feared that the insurance so "the money" from the krankenversicherungherausführen.
That is why the doctors the vaccines even shopping, and have to wait until the insurance should pay for this for you.
According to the estimates are the specific practical doctors per month of 40,000 kroner to invest, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy at all, says cabrnochova.
Still you and we
Can the Muslim To Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time in the Swiss voters for a bauverbot voted for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, said John Bowen, an American academics, a learned and thoughtful report, written on it, whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated – and be integrated.
This new book will be a few readers out of admiration for the last work of the author, "why the French No scarves love" (originaltitel: "Why the French don ’ t like headscarves") (2006) Read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of an issue that divided the country, about one and a half decades and employees and their effects are visible today.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good American, he would like to not only know what the politicians and the media about Islam in France say, but what is really happening in the area.
He has months in mosques, schools and colleges, which now spent the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it is known as Bowen "Islamic Liberty" offer.
He is a good audience, it gives debates between teachers and students, on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall marriage (or both)?
Should young Muslims on evolution and rights of gay people to be proven wrong?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it for one Muslim permissible to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he argues, represent the daily life, as opposed to the political crises, what the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name with perhaps the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss scholar Arab / Muslim born and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, the Bowen respondents, are usually at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia – the now of a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is the view that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires give and take on both sides.
He queries to what extent French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really pluralism committed.
He suggests that Muslims possibly a rauere treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, they experienced its historic compromise with the secular Republicanism had to make.
He sees more of a "tightening the werteschrauben" as a growing pragmatism.
Can the Islam Be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other umweltregion on Earth.
The ice they marked, is melting at an alarming speed and adopted life that can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, schifffahrts- and fishing interests, in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers, and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, paints in "On Thin Ice" (originaltitel: "on thin, I"), a history of the icon of the North, the polar bears.
In the complex history main and policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of arktiserforscher, which found itself in the hunt for the polar bears have demonstrated.
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old fähnrich to the sea, the only with the gewehrkolben his muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but some are true.
The young bear, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their recently schwammen mothers who have been killed in zoos and circuses.
A zirkusaufführung the beginning of the twentieth century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.
Even today still have typically zooanlagen a millionstel of the privacy of a wild alttiers suitable. The climate is rare: The Eisbär in Singapore, it was quite green, from the algae to the hollow hair of his fur grow.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and returns often to the threat, the Hunters for the survival of the species.
Although in Norway, America and Russia, is banned the succumbed in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and high-performance sturmgewehre motorschlitten-fahrende Inuits use to bring its prey to the route.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two jagdnationen the ice longest remain.
In his new book, "after the ice" (originaltitel after the "i"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins "New Scientist", a clear and disturbing description of the science of Arctic and a packenden insight into the way the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphärenwissenschaftler ozeanografen yet can adequately explain, the speed of the changes.
However, this is not for a lack of erklärungsversuchen.

But, starting with the bear on the ice until the microscopic be surprised in the ice, are all of them threatened, if a sommereis passes that in the period between 2013 and 2050.

For him and the other Marines, what the journey from camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the nationalfriedhof took in Arlington to graves to election campaigns, was the day a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps you are replaced.
In a few months from where we always have to be persuaded that we could this be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we would do, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I am trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, at kränze to the graves of veterans in several sections of the arlington-friedhofs.

Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, has made a deceased doing.
Although her husband has not being buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their path, which brought to give back something, the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we can support our soldiers, civilians.
It is like the visit of a familiengrabstätte.

The volunteers were older graves from the 1st and 2nd world war and the Vietnam war as a goal, as these are not as often as he visited the newer graves, so the organisers.
The mood was festive, children played and pairs remained by the hand, while they are the fresh kiefernzweige grabsteinen released to the gray.

The US government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has taken a contractor for the US administration, the phones and notebook-computer sold in the country, were arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Office on Saturday.
Until now, the contractor has not yet been identified, is for development alternative, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban right a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, from the accusation of the "risks" can be arrested.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the ease of protests and critical writings, suggest a verhaftungsrisiko include.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger-gemeinschaft, which the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, the frequently describes how she and her husband watched by government officials and attack it.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for a permit to leave the country for prizes that, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably be the tensions between the communist government of the castro-bruders increase in Cuba and the Obama a 'slow' overtures to improve relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first freitagnacht of the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will produce a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition.
Phones and notebooks in Cuba are legal, even though they are new and much-desired products in a country where the average salary of a government officials 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has not allowed ordinary citizens, since this year ’ s purchase of a mobile phone make, they will, but for the fact that text messages are used as a 15-minütiges phone call would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and work for foreign visitors, and some government departments, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect their names often the government.
Too many Web pages is the access restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American rare.
Most of the few American citizens in Cuba, which is sitting in jail for crimes such as smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the us-interessenvertretung press in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and the detention are clearly wrong.
A activity, which in any other free society would be legally - the levy of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, "who recently received a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba with the title" new Castro, the same Cuba "practically, a reference to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, of the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused, often within a day were arrested, convicted, and imprisoned.
He said that probably any solution would be a political, and that the Cuban government often a negative reaction in the United States at the time provoked, as both countries move towards one another for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials blankets plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered Saturday when a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy, the sought, five men from nord-virginia to Afghanistan, in order to send troops to kill, and have said that they hope the case could help to identify a wider network of terrorist recruiting sergeant to the Internet to find out after radicalised young men.
Detectives said that they are an obscure the rebels, known as Saifullah, had been seeking, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had to find them, because one of these on the internet-videoseite YouTube favourable comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah, it was after her arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of these men and was trying to help them, the remote area in Pakistan's stammesgürtel, the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah, the al-kaida-führer not sure that the men were not part of a cia-verschwörung to penetration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were given on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, held far from the inhospitable mountains in the North West, which has become a terroristenzufluchtsstätte.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they are rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men had not and continued to despair of trying to get the right advice, in order to maintain access to the al-kaida-lagern than they were arrested by the Pakistani strafvollzugsbehörden.
The case of five men - the remains are in Pakistan and questioned by the FBI - highlights the pivotal role of recruitment agencies in the identification of future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is to be trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the telling, on a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The recruitment agencies of the organization act as pförtner not let in, those whose commitment to the holy war not serious enough is and those that could be spies.
American möchtegern-rekruten will be provided by a Qaeda of a particular examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to us-zielen and its propagandawertes you will but also as immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, chief analyst of the nefa-foundation with headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups in the last few years to be much more cautious in granting access may have become, because the US intelligence services are experts of their rekrutierungsmethoden.
If you are trying to slip someone in these groups, what better way, we could go to consequences as the rekrutierungsmodell, which so many already have followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is based is now much more on the Internet.

This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the major demonstration - at the floor of a world-beating pass to appeal to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement to be reached, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way herumführt more, the question.
The police made the protestors from getting to close to the bella-zentrum and said that they have 19 people were arrested, mainly due to the fact that they either were or taschenmesser mitführten masquerading.

On the other hand, "We can also say that the negotiations or the liberty of other people will be bothered".

The picture on a six-year period, is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP has been covered in this district, fraud 60 skalenpunkte (262 to 202).
And although the sum total, the children of both groups have achieved in that time has increased, the difference with now 58 points barely diminished.
Some bildungsbefürworter of the distrikts last week expressed their concern that the results of schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been celebrated for the largest proportion of white students that are already high-achieving children were taken.
This suggests that we the gesamtwertung by the treatment of those in the upper end of the scale, have raised what problematic and is difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of the D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that bildungsgleichheit in Washington D. C..
I Springe not for a span of two or three points on and down, said the Democratic Washington stadtratsmitglied, Kwame R. Brown, of a subsidiary in the fourth category of the eaton-grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of the managementstils of Rhee, said that the message of prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city in need of urgent attention.
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, which I respect.
But I am frightened of is that we not spend the time and energy that we would have to commit to our mittelschule.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to address the needs of the leistungsschwachen pupils.
In this autumn for example, some teachers will be trained, a new leselehrplan to use the wilson-lese-system, on pupils in the upper classes of the primary school and mittelschule the basic skills of reading, not at the start of their schullaufbahn have mastered significantly behind its peer groups klassenkameraden behind.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten training to sixth class games and lebensechte experience in the limelight, highlights, was among the former chief schulinspektor Clifford Janey after Washington and this curriculum brought some of the naep-fortschritte, the last week have been reported.
I believe that we still need to work to the best measures to allow them to benefit the students from the notenniveau lie, Rhee said.
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to play the extra cash and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools can provide are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, the urban audit findings.
The conventional medicine is, its resources and management reforms to focus on the schools in the poorest parts of Washington, D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions, working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban schulinspektoren that it is trying, the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who now is schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft that is that the traditional public school year, which is in Washington today to extend 180 days, in order to compete with the charter-schulen.
It is the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, with his lehrergewerkschaft last year to reach agreement on 185 days per year ago, he referred to as "a milestone" on the road to a larger increase in the next treaty.
Higher education to more people than prospect
The coach of the gettysburg-college achieved with a noisy home.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising from and blinzelt a moment on the sight of the white pillars of the ziegelsteinfassaden and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have hardly the highschool in El Salvador completed.
Until recently, because Graciela had also in Silver Spring has been recovered and is now living in Riverdale, have never set foot in a college-campus.
Your attitude and that of the other achtklässler of the group, the Gettysburg see where the teaching per year costs $38.690, was more like that of a ehrfurchtsvollen besuchers, than that of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" rang Graciela to want to study medicine as the leaders announced that they have now had trodden the buildings for science.
"Wow, really?" she said, food for thought, as their low professor-zu-studenten-verhältnis the school reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, that the children have visited at their three-day tour and now they have fully include the intended message: The question is not whether it's college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, which the highschool not an end, or pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand, there is also, however, which received hundreds collegeausbildung that is needed up in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of hispanoamerikaner the college – which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States was to have been completed without the highschool.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it's for a generation, which has a huge role in the workforce of the country's will to play the way forward.
Those who study the high-achieving children, say, these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who give their children high objectives and to find ways of making their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But beratungsprogramme also play a major role to Graciela and by millions of children in college, as they should help to come, especially if these efforts will continue for long periods of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills they have in the wegsuche through the system, then it will help an individual measure at any time, not solve the problem, said Patricia gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, which examined hispanoamerikanische students.
We have to think about it, for those children by pre-school to network, supported by the highschool.
The bundesprogramm, the gracielas college-tour had funded, is a useful example.
It is known as gear up - get a hochschalten - and is more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems are available to begin to launch college-vorbereitungsprogramme, when low-income pupils in the mittelschule are and continuing until you have completed the highschool.
Under the us-department for education, the program since 1999, has helped more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% went in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies opposed
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government in two on Saturday completed auctions major oil companies could get his victims to rebuild infrastructure.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies, the Iraqi ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry for decades to play paralysed by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only shares in two of the 10 versteigerten of fields.
Seven US companies have had to participate in the second auction, paid on Friday began.
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been able to in the June contract for versteigerte fields.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry, analysts by surprise.
Iraq has at long last, after six years of war and instead of opened its doors to give us, Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, a online-nachrichtendienst.
There will be long be no other offers in Iraq.
Security concerns that have by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and the political instability have been stressed by the withdrawal of the US military incursions, American oil companies probably stopped the analysts said, as to be more engaged in Iraq, the third largest proven rohölreserven of the world has.
Firms were in some cases, penalised because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, much lower labour costs, and more risks, because it is not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and exploration by Occidental Petroleum, Inc., was the only American companies, the contracts with the department was able to conclude.
Major US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which has close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry in recent years and with technical Council on the side, are empty.
The Russian company petrol and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of this weekend contract conferred upon.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has essential for more treaties than any other companies with large packages and could in contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the speaker of the ölministeriums, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way, one of the major economy, as well as a technologiemacht.
We are convinced that the Chinese companies can attach itself with its mitbietern and his commitments to Iraq, will meet.
For the gebotsabgabe vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, what then with the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the ministry was willing to pay each Felds emissions over the current level.
Top-planer of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, apparently killed
In an apparent us-raketenangriff along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week to a top-einsatzplaner of Al Qaeda have been killed, representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung reported Friday.
This would be, if it were true, the second deadly attack on a high leaders of the terrorist organisation, in this autumn.
Saleh al-somali was one of two Arabs, the under United States sources and Pakistani behördenvertretern the region of a number of rockets are to be killed on Tuesday their vehicle in the vicinity of the town of Miran Shah in the province, met nord-waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drohnentyp by the CIA in the lawless stammesgürtel of Pakistan is used.
They were going in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car has been taken, said a civic leaders of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the stage and, soon everything itself, what of the "completely wrecked bodies" had left.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung led an unspecified evidence that claimed belonged to the dead.
It has been claimed as the top military planners of Al Qaeda, described the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was on plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If his central role taken for granted that it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He came strategic instructions from the topführern of Al Qaeda to and did in operationsplanungen for possible terrorist attacks.
Of the second American civic leaders said that, in the al-kaida-hierarchie's claimed quickly and best links to other extremistengruppen used in the region.
He may not be familiar to some Americans, said of the second civic leaders no reduced, but the threat he was for us and our allies.
If his death is confirmed claimed would be the second leading Al kaida- or talibanführer, which since September has been killed in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the stammesgebiet and three other topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks from CIA drones since the summer, according to a summary of the long was Journal, one of a non-profit organisation, the private website, of an average of six operations per month to two dropped.
The decline is based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, the steps to reduce their vulnerability and that at the same time, brutally killing suspected informers, said the side.
Having been a United Nations delegate in Kabul leaders will resign
The senior UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he resign from his post in March, will end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election, supported by the UN has been clouded.
We oath, as the Obama decided further 30,000 US troops to send to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the truppenerhöhung, but he expressed his concerns about too, that the us-zeitplan for the military withdrawal, which is due to start in 18 months, other nato-regierungen could lead to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of the Afghan security forces and make the right signal to the Afghans that you send, the international community can trust, said Eide in a telefoninterview from Kabul.
The commitment must be for the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian aid workers, the increase in the political conversion of Afghanistan supposed to help.
The truppenerhöhung on the military side, an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he should resign his office, but just one in March 2008, his family to grant agreement just two years to remain in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification of UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he will have time for a substitute.
What I said was that he better begins, to find a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the are my predecessor, and of my arrival.
Ban, in accordance with un-vertretern with the search for a replacement has started.
The UN officials say that he is the schwedisch-italienisch-stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently chaired the UN mission in Baghdad, and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the previously led un-friedensoperationen, has considered.
Oath position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country to prefer the evidence of massive electoral fraud and a cover-up.
Eide has denied all the allegations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired, "the mission has undoubtedly damage, because it is already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election was."
Eide said that the appointment of a senior civilian representative suggested, with the assistance of the American's armed forces to coordinate in Afghanistan.
He also entered the un-führung his successor, allowed more staff from the United States and other Western countries for the Afghan mission donation, and has said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment over the reduction of its forces in Afghanistan and has said that the circuitous un-einstellungsregelungen have undermined its potential to bring, capable people.
The un-regeln are designed in such a way that I have been since May, he said, only one person has been able to adapt.
This is a disaster and must not continue.
Defense Secretary Gates: Iran with additional sanctions must expect
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because it does not take part in talks on its Kim has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of around 300 US troops in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic does Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options for the election, he said, as the answer to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things my soul, is, if we, in the last six years have learned something from Iraq to the war own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama prefers a sanktionspaket in recital at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could affect durchschnittsiraner too.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required "in order to convince the Iranian government with nuclear weapons, that it is in reality less protected", because "Monsters' of their people are suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders agreed to in a warning that the Iran with a "credible" consequences, if he has to deal with its nuclear program is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, exercising.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, said of Iran that he talks to curtail its nuclear programme and would restart a crucial part of his lagerbestands of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuklearbrennstoff would forgo for its medical research reactor.
The US government has forced to these kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran appears since that time, however, the negotiations with the preliminary agreement to have to leave, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether it should commit to the United States.
The international community for Iran to in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, has abandoned simply are, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way, as it brought in connection with significant additional sanctions on Iran have never been, said Gates.
President Obama has the 31 dez. set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he had other options, including those to the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton again called "crippling sanctions" which will continue.
In one in New York popular opinion, the Iranian representative at the United Nations on Thursday about what they condemned as "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of certain members of the Iranian atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready, the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to pursue an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, on the last Friday to return to Washington, on the morning met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he joined the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish behördenvertretern flew in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq is still high, in particular in regard to limits, property rights and the division of the public revenue.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the source of conflict, in order to avoid delays in arms, the American troops by the end of August of 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. Us-vertreter quoted Gates Masud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will its security, its prosperity and its autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propagandaplakaten to lecture you crossed that "Mother Earth is too tired to have further children" and "one more baby means one more graves".
These lessons have you learned so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, the by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, all of a sudden, began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child immediately and forever, their answer was: "Definitely not."
We already have all our time and energy invested in a baby.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, verzogenen einzelkindern, the affectionately called "Little Emperor", has bred, draws a bevölkerungskrise in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple of compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, is the UN
Department for demography, while the number of the group of 60 years of age and older by the year 2020 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31,1 percent to rocket. This is far above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is with better educated population in rich coastal cities, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60-year and older nearly 22 percent of reported residents in Shanghai, agreed while the birth rate, with one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to help "the proportion of the ageing bevölkerungsanteile and the labor to mitigate the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old, but not so rich -- such as the industrialized countries, such as Japan, and Sweden, to be," she said.
A gradual easing
In the country's constitution enshrined in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal by the ruling Communist Party until now been introduced.
Against this policy married couples, must reckon with huge fines -- on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese staatsvertreter have attributed these policy, that the critical financial pressure on the natural landesressourcen could be avoided, whereas abuses in human rights activists have condemned the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some civil servants pregnant, already a child abzutreiben were forced to.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, and take an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years for public officials to have gradually weakened her position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been einzelkinder -- and 2007, the tone of many of hard slogans be toned down.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for bevölkerungsforschung of the University of Beijing, said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example to allow two children, couples in which one partner is einzelkind.
Shanghai fell in July for the first Chinese city, the an aggressive campaign to promote more births has launched.
Posters, families belehrten, only to have a baby, were almost over night of directives, describe in detail as to who is a second child, and how to apply for the licence.
The city government, municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, for couples sent go and homes informationsblätter durchzuschieben under the doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice to be made available to the more than one child.
The reaction was not particularly encouraging, said familienplanungsvertreter.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a recovery in the requests from couples to have to realize is that after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban counties reported against any change.
In the municipality huinan with a population of 115 000 are still per month, as one example, only four to five applications.
Disheartened Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still at approximately 165,000 will lie -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the familienplanungskomitees by the Shanghai Municipality caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want their first the best offer, they said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, have said that they would like to have two children, and that that was legally permissible.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a slight sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the west of the one-child policy wrongly assessed as a question of human rights, said Yang, an engineer whose madam of the seventh month, is pregnant with their first child.
Yes, it is robbing us of the chance to have more than one child.
The problem, however, lies not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples spend psychological reasons for their reticence.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said that she wanted just one baby, because it was a einzelkind. "we were the heart of the family and used that everyone has for us.
We are not accustomed to worrying about others and want to take care of it really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-jähriger, a übersetzungsunternehmen, said more merciless heard.
For parents with doppelkarriere from the middle class, through the birth rate is falling, he said, it is pivoting to be successful and, to do that you have to be selfish.
Today, the age of 20 to 39-jährigen mounted thus on, their parents during the early days of the Chinese kapitalismusexperiments fight to see and they want to do as a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother, her social lives drop for at least two years.
Then there is the raumfrage -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life -- "If the child 9 months old, is already a CV for the best nurseries have finalize."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time precedent, said Chen, but not two time.
Our generation is the first, which has reached a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to put too many victims.
Uno-gruppe sketches plan for emissions reduction
Promoted by the UN conference on climate change -- which have until now by Wilde postures and mutual accusations was emphasized during Friday -- has, with the publication of a document, another priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrialised nations in the near future have to bear the largest burden.
The text that is the basis for a final political agreement on regulation of greenhouse gases could provide both the remaining obstacles to did their exchange rates, as well as to the way forward.
But he was an important step forward in a negotiation, which the time, as next week, is based on more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special UN working group has been set is silent on the money supply, the rich countries should give to the poor countries, so that in the short and long term global warming.
It also offers a range of options for the key questions, including how advanced and big emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global rise in temperature should be, the policymakers.
The process will be a great flexibility, so John coequyt awarded, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, of the six pages of document, has sketched out a 180 pages long verhandlungstext, summarised in the heart of what the leading klimaschutzvertreter the UN, Yvo, Mr de Boer, as "the great whole.
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the developed country by 2020, together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the values of 1990, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 per cent would reduce.
Together, the countries of the emissions by 2050 reduction by 50% to 95%.
The European community has the talks a boost on Friday by her confirmation addition, over the next three years to allocate $3.6 billion per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the avoidance of deforestation.
The Friday, nevertheless the same verbal fireworks, which the talks in the past week, had intended.
Of the American klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern, formulations refused, the binding reductions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, are demanding, if these do not have to be funded by the industrialised world.
This train has been announced that the Obama take a stronger line with China as a representative of the Bush administration, not more than two years.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries stand up and take action as well as star in, sued the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion after an hour of the statement of the Chinese vizeaußenministers He Yafei, which said that the leading American klimaunterhändler either to "the common sense, or that it" feels "highly irresponsible" of him was that he was at the beginning of the week said that the United States would help China is not financially to cope with the global warming.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers at stake, both in the industrial economies, and between the industrialized nations and emerging economies fissures.
The current fight relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, and at the Save the planet, with China and the United States squabbles about their respective obligations, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen most influential countries ignoring the scientific imperative, more courageous action.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, has said that it is not surprising that the major powers, which are fighting to who the cost of the bremsung of the reduction should bear even the affected countries have begun to take action, aggressive in the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe for your actions accountable.
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic hegemony, so ulate, also as regional klimawandelberater for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America is operating.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change, said that they will continue to be a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, even though the leading participants say that the talks in the best case, will lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members, on the early Friday morning issued a 24-seitigen draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, has said that the offensive of small island states, "political pressure on the overall political process," partly because they now are united, and measures of the emerging markets, such as China and India, are asking for.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding questions before the arrival of the leaders must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and they take rest breaks through the corridors of the bella-centers behind closed doors to meetings and press conferences to chart claims during the coming week to be negotiated.
The sheer scale of the Assembly 13,000 people -- Daily in kongresszentrum and, gitarrespielende activists hold night-time shows where you make fun of the countries that you feel betrayed and sell, and be draft by hand on hand, rather than by email passed on already -- is a challenge.
The intensity has been building just recently: nearly all the important ministers have come here and as of Wednesday, 60 leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h quicker train defines the montagsgefühl newly
The Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe penetrate the darkness in order to announce a zugabfahrt a revolution in the movement in Britain.
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country will be in his blitzfahrt of ashfort, Kent, after London St Pancras 225 km / h achieve and 93 km in 38 minutes to go.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will Lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first javelin-pendlerservices travelled from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally, an international network of faster, more reliable trains ankoppeln, and the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland's connectivity to London.
The neglected province to living pendlerstädten could arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would be radically reduced and the change of plane and car to railways would the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, do the three major parties in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds, the for the construction of a new national rail network are needed, the unavoidable planungsschlacht and fears about damage to the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still draw the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company that is based in January, the government is being asked to produce a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, the Times, according to the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed streckenkarte the next planned stage of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway system, the London with the West Midlands, will unite with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places with, where the effects on the environment are controversial.
In the free site, the plan the concept within a gap of 25 metres of the final stretch.
HS2 will also three options for a major, hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz leading northwards.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which an individual high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be based in or near Birmingham parts and a abzweig dignity west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland, and a different result in lines north-east after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead after Scotland.
"It appears the most viable option," said a eisenbahn-insider.
After the completion would the tourist season between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section before 2025, would be opened up, it would allow travellers the stretch London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little over an hour to go.
The drafts fact, the outlines of the opportunity, with a speed of 400 km / h, increasing the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first line has been planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the line London-Birmingham be in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be it.
Given the space limitations in the capital, is expected that an existing station would be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Bahnexperten say that only St Pancras International, or Euston of this potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether this plan is to give his view, should be pursued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision would be taken until after the general election.
But if he set the wheels in motion, must be built in sections of the rail network.

The labor UDF (Union for French democracy), energetic and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, not more, to use their Siegel
The labor that of François Bayrou ’ s party Modem is monitored, has a tentative takeover on Friday torchbearer, once of Valéry Giscard d ’ Estaing formed party, on the part of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted bitterly it under threat of judicial persecution this Siegel called upon to use on any document longer.
Hervé Morin, publicly announces its intention to take on this udf-siegel, because he is of the opinion was that François Bayrou would not worthy of this political legacy to defend, after he had left the hand is.
The defense minister, whose parteipartner the UMP is, in fact, wanted to, this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
The emphasis of his work, he had the support of members of Hervé de Charette (ehemalig UMP, NC) are now, the one claim to the ownership of the brand UDF, because he was the first this brand 2004 in the 'Institut National de la Propriété industrial "has asked for.
However, the geschäftstelle of François Bayrou's's friends was supervising parteienbündnisses UDF the silence and was clearly to understand that they gave and coped expropriate not the minister, as well as the members, under threat of judicial persecution a deadline of this Siegel to use and not more of it the property of the brand.
You have, in recent days a number of declarations that their political movement would propose to take on the udf-siegelzu + +, wrote that Labor in one, of 19 of the 24 letter signed büromitglieder, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party modem and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They believed perhaps also that they have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau Centre Plus, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material and the startseite leads their website.
As you know that you are not entitled to the use of this Siegel's, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the Party in NC, "without mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and of (your) website" to remove.
Furthermore, one claimed by Hervé de Charette, "the ownership of the trade mark to transfer from their legal anspruchsberechtigen".
If they refuse to give a complaint against you, we will impose the law and respect the legitimate rights of udf-mitglieder to defend, warned the undersigned.
In her letter, you emphasised that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement is and reiterate that Morin and his friends "have taken" the choice to leave this 2007, in order to establish a competing movement as others had done in 2002 by the party "UMP '.
The party Nouveau Centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the udf-siegel (Union pour la démocratie Française).
They remind remains that of the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year join the party Modem, as well as the establishment of a secretariat for the defense "of the material and moral interests" of the of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing movement is based, has adopted.
What Hervé de Charette, it is continuing with the registrar, "was he at the time, as he has requested the brand name for three years, a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He was to scandalous and deceptive way benefited from the absence of the deposit of the akronyms UDF to implement this for themselves.
They continue to be concerned that these recklessness on the best ways is to transform into a crime, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us but in politics as in life, was present to make a name for themselves, rather than to try to come out of anonymity, by relying on fraudulent way, takes on a name which has no claims".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt, François-Marie Banier will condemn it because exploitation of weakness
The Court of of Nanterre, on the Friday François-Marie Banier, decided to assess the artist to determine whether he, as the daughter of the milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt said that a weak moment of achtzigjährigen has used a portion of their assets, devious to.
The 62-jährige photographer who is known for his starfotos, on 15 and 16 April 2010 because of exploitation of weakness in court to answer for, a punishable by a maximum of three years ’ imprisonment and a fine of €375.000 be punished.
This decision means that it is in fact a process in this affaire will be the saga of one of the richest families of France is worthy of mother and daughter shreds, and at the same time the reins of the kosmetikimperiums L Oréal in the hand.
However, the 15 court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährigen Liliane Bettencourt, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir to and hauptaktionärin of L Oréal, so far, has refused such an inquiry to be subjected to especially among, during the investigation of the public prosecution service of Nanterre's conditions.
Doctors are on Friday appointed before the 10th March 2010 to submit a report in which it will clearly be aware of whether, and at what times are Liliane Bettencourt in a state of weakness may have found.
I think that you will undertake to these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Ms Bettencourt, me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
By Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers what the lawyer, me Olivier Metzner is concerned, it is the decision of the court of very satisfied.
This is excellent news (...). The reports will prove that he (Banier) this old lady was rigged, and it needs to protect, he reiterated.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and allroundkünstler, and he accused the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to get grants from a total of one billion euro in the form of bankschecks to devious, insurance policies, or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt had always turn judged to have been manipulated by the photographers, which they see as a longtime friend.
Although the Court of the admissibility of of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers to examine the complaint, the plaidoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large familiendebakel.
So, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt to three of his klientin on their notary were sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the husband of counterparties.
According to her lawyer added Liliane Bettencourt to the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I had fifteen years, one- or twice daily to Banier wrote.
Since she married Françoise, I was never able to speak any more. "
The public prosecution service of Nanterre is, once again, the view that the klägerin had no right to respond, especially because a vormundschaftsrichter in the last few days has rejected their request, a legal form of protection against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection, and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine daubigney.
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the process to the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If nothing will change at the leaders of the big French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the company vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing-revolution: it is for staff to "values" to the best, as it was earlier in the consumer-produkte of the technicians in the plant to impose shaped.
By sending the customers in the heart of the company, the marketing-revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets been in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers regularly again to impose!
A demobilisation of the staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, invested or Renault are just the tip of a much wider phenomenon, in particular the staff affected.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular to those of F & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the OU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "of all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; you by the staff claimed a use to which the instructions of the authoritarian management totally disagree.
We therefore call upon a occupational revolution that it would be the staff in denmittelpunkt the concerns of the company to put on an equal footing with the client.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
Will the internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange his, this revolution has made in relation to the management-praxis suggest?
I fear, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that the whole structure with a new situation after many a circuitous route, after all, the priority is, to do... what it has always done.
Also because of the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because the majority of senior managers have a very simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the big ingenieurschulen emerged is your interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently of the US "pioneering" reactivated and unwittingly far-reaching from research institutes, and by the media.
By then, and it suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) to the commitment of staff, confirms to engage in a aktuellein Le figaro.fr appeared Ipsos poll executives in a position to a mechanistischen management system, which is not suitable for today's world.
The mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and attach
Instead, for the smooth operation of the modern company necessary operational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate an essential protocol: for the workers is the commitment to the company, it would only be possible if it appears clearly as a means to be a part of their dreams, their ambition and their project to be realised.
Currently the only play the studies from the multifunctional analysis this idea of the motivation of staff.
These studies have shown that they put their companies on the basis of a given set you doxa judge by their wahrgenommenes picture of the company's stock, which allowed it to them to realise their life.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these mobilisierungsfaktoren can the leaders of the company's "social services" anticipate, predictions and control and human resource management, in the right place again.
So, they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence is good.
Talk of Oslo: the "just war" leads Obama praise from the right an
On Friday, the American Right by Barack Obama on the eve in Oslo crafted speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 the term of the "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, which is the allocation of the prize to Obama on 9 October, were mocked, applauded this time the speech by the president, the example of the former vizepräsidentschafts-kandidatin in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, told Palin the face of the right of the Republican Party in the daily newspaper, USA Today, and added that she herself the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben raised memoirs are published.
The war is, of course, the last of which I believe that the Americans wish to do so, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, has inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has in Oslo on Thursday, trying to justify the use of force; a manner his entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30,000 additional troops to send to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Gingrich Gingrich, took the view that the präsdent voted in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good frohlockte the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's recognised.
In some parts habeich this speech very much ginrich seen as historic, said in the radio programme "The takeaway" been consulted.
The previous members of by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election is considered in 2012, said he was pleased to see a "president of the left" to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee remind us that they were "not without a price for not able to pass the peace, when the use of force would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former writer of George W. Bush and is now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to this, in that it represents itself as "cosmopolitan", like "He always power", he was "like a US president spoke about", as he pointed out that the Europeans, "as in a sicherheitsblase lives they have built for themselves and for their protection they do not do a lot," says Gerson.
Among the few, not the converted rights, called the former ambassador John Bolton, a hawk that the era of Bush's speech on the website of the National Review online as "boring, unfocused and inspirationslos."
To the left of the president is the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces.
Packaged the war, under the guise of the judiciary, is the massacre of the Innocents quite easy to justify, he warns.
The Press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, the still of the view is that of the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the address even for a speaker as he is widely known for his talent as a "club".
The speech in Oslo "provides a ablaufplan to the governance of the international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times is the view that Obama is "the necessary discourse," and his speech, described as "grim and revealing at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: three marathons for the agreement, which will ensure the supply to Christmas
After a three-week these marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the straßenverbandes and the TLF - the only employers' organisation, which until the end of remained to an agreement on Friday evening - the streikbefehl and the imminent serious versorgungsengpass puts an end to Christmas.
In the unterschriftssitzung at on Friday evening "welcomed" the for the transport of the competent State Secretary Dominique Bussereau the agreement that launched on Wednesday morning after several verhandlungswochen.

However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11: 00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and it was only about 18: 00 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "should the company very much damage" and "it was feared that he will have the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau would affect.
The agreement provides for a lohnsteigerung at 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional transport) and at 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The stundensatz for workers with the lowest wages are rising from 8,72 euro on 9,06 euro.
"This is not very much but we are small in the first place," says Mr CLOs (FO).
The activists, who are now no longer dependent versorgungszentren to block it.
"It will, however, always likely to be some rebellious, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The tlf-vorsitzende Philippe grillot spoke of a "good agreement" that "though it was difficult in light of the international competition that this wage Bible".
According to him, increasing at 170 euros a month for the low and in 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," Maxim Dumont (formerly), whereas Thierry douine (CFTC) of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT), said on "an acceptable compromise in this regard."
The agreement also provides for the increase in the cost of travel by 3% and meet the objectives of the overall budget for the road in the first half of 2010, which will allow it in particular, the issue of 13 monatsgehalt and the modernisation of the collective bargaining agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "sinking the charges for the employers in the tune of 100 million euros," the subject of an amendment to the bill, the government berichtigten finances for 2009 was, on the night of Thursday, on Friday was approved by the National Assembly.
The government is asking for a "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organization affiliated companies, and that they were in the case of an extension through the Minster for the entire profession.
This will be "in the shortest possible time" of the case, Bussereau insured.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only postpone the trial.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "rogue trade" because the 100 million euro "were the sector to offset some of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the gans-esser of the approaching weihnachtstagen not, laments the unostra disgruntling.
Otre for the association put in agreements "the small and medium-sized businesses in the industry in the next 12 months to have a major graves spades."

Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21, not all can be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is "the new heart of Europe".
Quite so. S21 is much more than that tieferlegen of a bahnhofs, more than a monströses construction project that the city of baden-württembergischen country's capital for a decade plunge in unholy baustellenchaos.
Stuttgart 21, from the spirit of the 1980's.
Kopfbahnhöfe with tracks that end up in the middle of the city, was seen then as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century, the as bremsklötze of a modern rail transport, as it once appeared to have a tremendous amount of time needed, locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen.
Trial continue to travel, in short, reality is ´ s move.
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe disappearance: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof the rules half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
Will S21 tackling now actually, even though the vision of the 1980s no longer be compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city is almost priceless to implement the tieferlegen.
Kopfbahnhöfe have, however, not a one- and ausfahrtsproblem more, since there modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen are at both ends.
Still, Stuttgart 21 and the ice-neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed.
State and local representatives are enforced.
Power with the railways, partly because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts of the Republic of taxpayers and not the staatskonzern.
Städtebaulich is still reasonably justify the project.
There is new stadtraum, is the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is S21 harmful.
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are for the movement of people thought that the one - typically 1980s - huge growth zuschrieb.
At that time there was still no competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy but it must first be about to strengthen the freight transport, because of the transportation by rail much is more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the neubaustrecke worth because of intense steigungen not for freight trains.
Much more serious is that there are many other bahnprojekte S21 also indirectly affected.
Good to six billion euros in schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic.
The fact is, in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network are missing.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the department.
One of the most important is the expansion of the asset 180 kilometres long journey through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route in the zeitlupentempo being built.
Is so desperately needed, here right on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The rheintalstrecke is the real bottleneck for the international movement of goods, right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines verdict on the airport
The provincial government has left open wiesbadener Landtag, whether against the judgment of the hessischen verwaltungsgerichtshofs (vgh) for night flights in review.
The CDU / fdp-koalition have asked experts to take the more than 400 pages of comprehensive vgh-urteil legally review, said Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The vgh in Kassel, most of these days in writing that the country in the event of the construction of the planned nordwest-landebahn the night flights at Frankfurt Airport to new rules.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as is the provincial government, was not with the legally necessary protection of the population from the noise night flights to agree.
The coalition until 4 January, needs to decide whether it against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticised the postponement and drive to the representatives of the government, to a revision in the bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
Torsten spd-fraktionschef schäfer-gümbel called for CDU and FDP, back to her before the election promise made to a ban on night flights. Otherwise, this is a return to a "breach".
It is hellishly difficult to be if you should keep its word grünen-chef Tarek al-Wazir, said in an allusion to the fdp-wahlslogan "we feel that word".
Mr Posch, the accusation of schäfer-gümbel falling, the provincial government attempts, with "rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" still to come to their night flights.
A precise legal inspection need to do your time.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression of" operate.
We need a legally secure entscheiung, said Stephen Müller (FDP).
As it marks the opposition, are the statements of his group for the night flights never have been.
Cash figures support decreasing
The troubled US behemoths swath of their government shackles.
The Bank of America, on Wednesday the aid from the bankenrettungsfonds TARP, amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) to back a stroke.
And also to the Citigroup is planning for a report by the us-senders CNBC, the state aid they pay.

Quick election
It was then, but all quicker than expected.
Barely two weeks after the zdf-verwaltungsrat the editor-in-chief Nicholas Brender had pushed out the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the panel was to vote on the personalie.
As favorite was, Peter Frey, head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios in Berlin.
A confirmation by the sender, so it was not, however, the procedure - officially not look ahead.
However, it will also have played a role, the zdf-intendanten Markus schächter should not further damage, this proposal to the board of directors will not be retained.
Frey, schächters candidate, needs the support from nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder.
The result of the vote was in redaktionsschluss this edition.
Two weeks ago schächter with his proposal, the contract with Nicholas Brender for a further five years, the board of directors failed.
Only seven members of languages for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for schächter, a erwartbare, however.
Because the unionsmehrheit in the board of directors had already weeks before the election, Brender not in the post, indicated to want to confirm.
Had organised resistance to the editor-in-chief of Orlando Koch Hessische prime minister.
With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept a further term of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs.
Until just before the election, there have been so, protests in which political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Most recently, even 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, chefs and to be reexamined unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
To person
Peter Frey on 4 August 1957, was born in Bingen.
He was an undergraduate politics, teaching methods and romanistik.
Later, he worked in the südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
Frey changed in 1983 for ZDF first the "heute-journal."
Subsequent stations, 1988 until 1990 personal spoke of the chefredakteurs; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and host of "morgenmagazins"; by 2001 head of the zdf-außenpolitik head of the zdf-hauptstadtstudios; since then.
The green once Brenders announced the dismissal on Wednesday or the branchenblatt medium magazine for journalists of the year was elected a verfassungsklage.
The board of chefs adversary rheinland-pfälzische Prime Minister, Kurt Beck, has stated in the past week, the countries should change the zdf-staatsvertrag so that personalvorschläge of the intendanten not by a politically motivated majority can be blocked.
An excerpt of parteipolitikern from the supervisors of the ZDF, however, was also Beck.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey, the board of directors with a wise move, the board recommended by immediately after the brender-abwahl sharply criticized for it.
Thanks to this belegs journalistischer independence without loss could both schächter him for the job of chefredakteurs nominate and elect the board without having to get the suspicion that a partisan in order to lever into office.
In the parteiarithmetik Frey is already the liberal left-wing.
Studies will entrümpelt
Partial success for the students. After a year of bildungsstreiks drew culture minister of the countries on the Thursday at last a: at a meeting of kultusminister- and hochschulrektorenkonferenz both sides agreed the studienbedingungen in bachelor and masters course of wanting to improve.
The students should be able to handle their studies.
They are in individual leaders agreed to that in principle to reduce the prüfungsbelastungen each studienmodul is only with a single examination concluded.
The workload for students must also reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level".
Policy and Higher Education also want the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between universities within and outside of Germany.
The countries pledged to do so, common strukturvorgaben for bachelor- and Masters more flexible.
Of them, differing länderregelungen it should not be.
Less audits
Since the start of the student protests in June do ministers of education and uni-rektoren the saying of the better studierbarkeit in the mouth.
It has now been filled for the first time with a specific content.
The so-called akkreditierungsrat decided to issue the number of trials in part to reduce sharply: "Each Modul, usually with only a study from," it says in a 30-seiten-papier that the authorisation of courses should partially new rules.
With the "clear reduction in the prüfungslast ', said the akkreditierungsrat-vorsitzende Reinhold fairy tale," a risk that should be stopped, greatly exercised studierbarkeit. "
It also is the "studierbarkeit" from now on "The critical factor" in the design.
Modules as contents were "strictly in response to examine whether 'unnecessary einengungen of the students in the choice of
Events were to be avoided ".
The students' claim that margins would have to enable and promote the individually ".
To apply the rules to the approvals of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– which means that it will take until 2015, until all courses had been reviewed.
Bundesweit ten akkreditierungsagenturen are responsible, which are created by the countries akkreditierungsrat.
The culture minister had the countries in the October "with vigour", the agencies invited to make sure that the stofffülle the prüfungsregime not too big and not too rigorously.
In individual German federal states, universities and colleges with the landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
Than ever single country said it Rheinland-Pfalz for the development of the Bologna process to additional resources.
Of the money is to set up the universities in particular tutorenprogramme and studienberatung, as well as audit and auslandsämter strengths.
Country and universities want to make ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the hochschulgesetzes bring into the house.
After this, for the conclusion of a studienmodells just one more testing be necessary.
The studiengestaltung is intended to be more flexible, it is the recognition of leistungsnachweisen to other universities and to safeguard the access to master easier.
By the end of next year all of the country's courses are on their studierbarkeit be reviewed.
Government and opposition have had on Thursday again argued studienbedingungen in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The bundesvorstand the juso-hochschulgruppen called for the design of the education policy should will no longer "behind closed doors" of the ministers and hochschulrektoren take place.
At the latest, after the bildungsstreiks should now be the students as affected "a say too."
Support received the future academics of the president of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the culture with which the HRK on a common reform paper was discussed.
The trade union education and science (gew) went the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legally entitled, each graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a wider-ranging more Masters course.
On the other, the countries will ensure that for today ’ s generation of sufficient masterstudienplätze bachelor-studierenden morning with best possible studienbedingungen are available, so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries need more teachers.
Freer access to the Master, were the culture minister, does not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany, and to go for is nice almost no control... "reads the anfangszeile of a gedichts of the lyrikers Werner söllner in which this in troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of dissidents to be addressed, of the freedom won, but his language has lost.
The 1951, in the Romanian Banat natural-born Werner söllner - speaking German and first as had englischlehrer in Bucharest and later than lektor in a kinderbuchverlag before he worked in 1982 evident after Frankfurt.
Söllner is with various literaturpreisen been excellent, 1993, he was the legendary Frankfurt poetikvorlesungen to the goethe-universität, and since 2002, he is head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches of noise, he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which related to the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten".
Visibly unsure, transfer söllner read a statement in which he schriftstellerkollegen rumäniendeutschen, and others, Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer, his participation as in for the Romanian Intelligence Service has Securitate.
Together with some of those present had received the German sprachpreis söllner 1989.
The anwerbungsversuche had begun creeping first 1971.
I am, Castle söllner, "that is, someone on intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner söllner is in the Walter.
Almost simultaneously, with the nobelpreisehrung for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literaturszene and particularly the community of from Romania Buddhist German authors shaken by a case out of the throes and the cowardice of a political system makes identified on surveillance, and domestic spying.
Werner söllner is, so far one can say after bisherigem knowledge, not just perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate-akte have played a role in Walter, said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel, for him, and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had, for him, it was him in all difficult issues "herausgehauen," Markel.
It is a moral need to put this point to make.
Söllners declaration was in the form, and the audience unexpected, quite surprising, the commitment of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service, however.
Germany had been one of post-candlelight sole preserve for securitate-spitzel Herta Müller, had already written in the time, in July, after making her own acts, 914 sides had read.
The people concerned, we should be suspect, and in some people case speculation may also have known what klarname behind the decknamen Sorin, voicu and even Walter masked.
Unlike the now very intensified verfahrenssicheren sighting of the stasi-akten is the management of the legacies of the securitate-überwachung still very vague.
A systematic education in the last few years and has been hindered thwarted.
One of the birthler-behörde equivalent National Council for processing the securitate-akten (CNSAS) was only founded in 1999, but since then the record was more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the management of the files.
The influence of former securitate-mitglieder in Romania are still very great is, documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former securitate-chef from Temesvar dismissive about the prizewinner.
You have a climate, we have, finally, they are interrogated.
The scandal of power said is quite blatantly, in the guise of the freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case link söllner, as so often in connection with verschwiegener fault inevitable questions.
Why only now? who was? the calm reaction of damaged zuhörenden on söllners commitment suggests that the continuation of this chapter by urge rather than apportioning of blame and shame will be determined.
To genese the site of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if as a adrett gekleideter außendienstler of a very nice weihnachtsfeier, which had distributed a sports goods manufacturers goodies, as the new vfb-trainer Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastiktüte of the ausrüsters a 15-minute after midnight in a herbeigerufene. ¨ c-klasse rose
The man with the enormous boots dragged him because of chauffieren even foreign city.
Otherwise even he would have been able to drive - Alcohol was not in the game, and drunk before happiness was the 55-jährige neither.
Was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow, the work continues.
Or will not get.
In the words of the only three days earlier schweizers pledged: "We have reached the 8", in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1-erfolgs against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but let us not be fooled by the success: It was a brutally hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task on Sunday," before.
Then, it must, in Mainz the königsklassen-leistung in liga-alltag again.
And this is certainly exposed weaknesses again after the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Select
The 8 of the Champions League (hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March), on 18 December in Nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The joy on the decisively start of the babbel-nachfolgers was up to behaviour.
Not only with the supposed saviours, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time of self-confidence, dedication and spielfreude had given.
I have received to the players and I have told them that they should reflect on its strengths and I have encouraged them to be more adventurous, said seelenklempner gross this simple sounding recipe for success, in the therapeut Babbel but no effect was no longer in existence.
It has a certain magic, was babbel-befürworter Jens Lehmann, "if in football, a new impetus to happen sometimes things that no one thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after a verletzungspause thanks to his dynamism go straight to the best players on the place in the attempted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind," and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel was it obvious.
The VfB Stuttgart was not yet out of the woods, warns sportvorstand Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but above all, consistent.
As gross herding as well as players and managers before that, the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely überforderte defenses of the Romanian guests überzubewerten.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0: 4 evil Awakening Khedira, was to concerns.
And sportvorstand Horst Heldt reminded that a saisonziel been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
That Heldt of his 40th birthday, even after the first heimsieg since three months ago, was not much like celebrating, was on the events of the weekend in the form of a just before spielbeginn fernseh-interviews broadcast by torhüter Jens Lehmann fresh auflebten.
There are decisions that the other meetings, and not the Jens, Heldt which countered Lehmanns harsh criticism.
The had accused the board of directors and the proven führungsschwäche trainerwechsel have decided to pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day after play had been deleted, girls Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmanns statements are "of pure egotism," keilte Heldt, vowing consequences for the schlussmann.
It seems they will no friends for life more, the two of forty.
After all but they were with all the other agreed that, without the groundwork through the abgelöste trainerteam the spielerisch and aggressive would not have been possible, strong idea.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success" in unison, said Heldt and Lehmann - and the man with the plastiktüte agreed.
Wm-fight in emphasis
They hitziges in Bern: continually provoked challenger Kevin Johnson became the World Cup champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds he defended the Ukrainians his schwergewichts-titel after version of the WBC.
The ruling unanimously, the judges argue fell.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko box-weltmeister remains in emphasis.
The 38-jährige champion after version of the Association WBC defeated in the night on Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson, unanimously after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful titelverteidigung in October 2008 after his comeback.
Earlier, twice world champion, was the Ukrainians, the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, with the K.O., which all expected to have not worked.
Klitschko has built his record of 39 victories in 41 profi-kämpfen from, twice, he had to take on the grounds of injuries to be beaten.
Challengers had to Johnson in the 24 fight the first defeat accept.
About 17,000 viewers in the Berne arena wanted the 2,02 metres great Klitschko the fight, in particular, with his left führungshand dictate.
Of the 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, the first of which they announced the end of the klitschko-ära however, turned away from the blows of the weltmeisters again and again, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights are not crucial to the objective could bring.
Overall, the passive Johnson fact, too little for a defiant and sought only on the round.
True, he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the top of the league but only rarely.
He is, after all, it was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
Of the challengers, before the fight in the Swiss capital for some.
He outraged Klitschko as "ugly zombie", the "not true".
The cradles, the champion then get on Friday, Johnson the sonnenbrille schubsen by the nose, "about his eyes to see."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos comeback
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback win on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of time out he had Nigerians Samuel Peter in Berlin, beaten and "his" wbc-gürtel, recouped he had previously made without a struggle.
In that year he defeated in his titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in the September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I have in this fight is only a blow train and am physically very good in form, Klitschko had the rapid return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the Association of all four major title in the family.
Brother Vladimir is WBO and IBF world champion of the associations.
The belt of the WBA is David Haye, the Briton, after this, in November, the 2,13 metres great Nikolai walujew been able to dethrone.
Haye had previously in the summer of one for September planned fight against Vitaly Klitschko canceled.
Supposedly does its promotiongesellschaft now already the fight against Klitschko in London wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information on the kunduz-affäre described as a liar.
SPD and left sought explanations of the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - the latest information on the bombing of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister to Karl-Theodor Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanklastzüge of September "knowingly the untruth" said grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday in the ard-nachrichtensendung "Tagesschau".
This has been widely believed, he lied.
The order for the killing was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have been granted.
This is the substance of the report, the Nato was to the Mr Guttenberg, who has read Trittin said.
Friday was revealed that the attack not only about the destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also about to kill two talibanführer purposefully.
In the German kunduz-kommandeur Colonel Klein were requested, according us-luftangriff nato-untersuchungsbericht up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, SPD and left have called for on Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to intervene before the Bundestag to say and also to clarify what Guttenberg really know about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the afghanistan-politik the federal government is - and whether chancellery, armed forces and intelligence service have approved of this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and grünen-kollegin Renate Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellery was not on concrete operations of the Bundeswehr influence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the representation of the ministry about the reasons for the dismissal of generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg accurate and complete information on the background to the tanklaster-anschlags.
Officially, it was said that you had the existence of the nato-berichte lied and the minister sensitive details.

A response have not so far received it, it says.
On Saturday the ministry expressed not to the allegations and pointed out that this be resolved in the inquiry committee of the Bundestag who set next Wednesday.
Traumwelten
Some see in wachem state pictures and hearing voices, the other not see or hear them.
Not only of mental health and the drogenrausch blurring the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it is happening in sleep, all is well.
If we, with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should unbound the wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden indulge in.
But anyone who witnessed the wachsein traumartige situation, things will see and hear, the other is not able to see and hear is true in the modern Western world mostly as a madman or drogensüchtig, at least as a sonderling.
But such images and voices are emerging not only in the case of mental health, or in drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: the same neuronalen processes that will enable us to design houses pictures, to write to fundamentalists, or novels, sure, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream and reality, fantasy converge.
Traumartig modified wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call it vision, in the worst case of obsession.
Even if cause and effect may distinguish the vision of the mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of the new-age-propheten Carlos Castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when that balance of neuronalen cortisol, especially neurotransmitter in the brain, noradrenaline and serotonin and acetylcholin - derailing and the interaction of various gehirnteile is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The gravity has no power over him
The connection of delusion and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle term hallucinations as a form of the dream for the guards situation, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted 1861 a "great similarity of the irreseins with traumzuständen", for Sigmund Freud was the dream "a climate of all, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, false such."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comicfigur.
His body is developed along two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him, he is hanging in the zimmerdecke.
He senses a date.
Behind him saying, distorted fratzen teufelsgestalten with blutroten, zähnefletschend.
They will hunt him to it with heavy, flammenden 1992, let him against the walls, it senses the pain on the entire body.
Noisy, malicious votes dröhnen from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices, who attributing and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet to a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeakers and is quietly tightening the noose around the neck.
Strikes one.
The noose is replacing itself.
This should be a lesson to you, shout the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide climate manisch-depressiv, moreover, he is, he adopted medicines, against the depression, which the obsession with schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with the disease for three years, he is married.
I was worst in the climate of fear and deepest despair, he says.
The cruel reality are mere empty words
Around one per cent of the population became ill, at least once in the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics will it as the second most disease after the Depression.
In an emergency schizophrenic climate generally interested can no longer distinguish between the internal and outside world, you get trapped in a state of übererregten to hallucinations, has scale, relationships or verfolgungswahn can lead.
It is particularly prevalent stimmenhören - the ordering them, to vote or dialogisieren comment.
Even visual hallucinations are not rare.
The person no longer can important to separate from unwichtigem, the brain can no longer ausfiltern embarrassing signals the awareness will be overwhelmed by impression.
As the dream is also the climate is opening the floodgates for a deluge of ideas and fantasies, the deeper bewusstseinsschichten are from.
In the climate of the realitätswahrnehmung is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the event, everything has a on him importance.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as happens in the dream, of the events overwhelmed and it cannot be active.
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realitätsabgleich is generally have not possible, the cruel reality are mere empty words, wake up.
Once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says Fox, "is but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the climate, basically."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality, the Verfremdung of the erlebens will take place in the real context.
Exactly why our brain antics tolls, is still a mystery to researchers.
Can ausnahmezustände leads in every person that he temporarily loses unrealistic, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only defining factors.
Researchers assume that, for stakeholders minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of the brain in an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained Fox.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neuronalen system will be established, and the first not manifestiere over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be spurred a climate, if the choice is there.
Even halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychoses, because it intervene in the transmittersystem.
If our brains hot expires
The crazy is, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money on drugs from which to come by, says the lübecker psychologieprofessor Erich castes.
Whether perceived as pleasant or unpleasant mere empty words, is often just a question of the position.
Box for 10 years, is compiling reports of hallucinations and trugerscheinungen, last year, he has made his findings in the book "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations may belong to the typical side effects of psychoses, but also of amazing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as borderline or depression often even diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's and schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, hallucinates themselves the brains of healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, put together from gedächtnisinhalten that would normally be withheld.
They arise when hirnareale where sinneswahrnehmungen be processed überaktiv are constrained or too little; if our brain is running the shirt, or indeed, if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger the condition, as well as brain damage or the climate.
But even reizentzug, stress, liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and is visiting the grammar school.
In a normal girl.
If it not for the images and voices.
In the interval, it can happen that an schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he replies, see the mitschüler it is surprising to - no one else does or does these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene tagträumerin, but Sarah K. are not dreaming about it, you know.
She is awake, you can see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank in addition to himself, and to hear.
It can even be felt its presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may hold the boys.
Am I mad?, asks, you are sometimes.
But you know, in fact, that of this boy and the other is not mere empty words are real and has disappear again.
At night, are the manifestations mostly frightening
Often, the mere empty words also a burden.
If you are sitting in the klassenraum, it can not follow the unterrichtsstoff sometimes, because of the teachers in their eyes and ears just presents a new mitschüler, while he for all other radio and visible from the bar of mathematical equations explained.
At night, are the manifestations mostly frightening.
If they are following in their dark room waiting to sleep far too little and far too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake, and is dreaming of, or already, whether the pictures that you see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding schnittwunden to poor and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me cry in silence on the make.
Parents and friends were told they would not keep it for crazy.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year, she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
The Internet for you to contact the psychologists castes has absorbed, they know exactly that he is not crazy.
Obsession is also a work of art out of desperation
If somebody is or socially isolated, has he suffering under reizentzug with great likelihood after a time, hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, is often, she played alone.
Your hallucinations as they started, with 13 learned that the man that they Papa, since they can think of not their leiblicher father is.
As in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same hirnbereiche active, are real impressions and reverse the process, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to reality and mere empty words. "every experience to distinguish," says castes, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, so you can give work so real. "
Even night-time traumbilder assesses castes, as a form of halluzination.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute climate.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, as unreal to see their mere empty words.
Castes advises his patients, therefore, that the hallucinations as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between dream and halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten the imaginary world is, unfortunately, are mostly pathologisiert, says Michael schmidt-degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chefarzt the clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the florence-nightingale-krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A climate is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries with it positive, creative - obsession is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has the so-called oneiroide erlebnisform researched, a particular form of the traumartig modified wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are multi-dimensional, detailed quasi-träume that the erlebende for real, and he subsequently also by the wachzustand not able to distinguish.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand is emerging in trauma- or krankheitsbedingten extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and weltverlust is under threat, for example by continuing, complete impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, the reality is, says schmidt-degenhard detached.
A kind of grenzzustand between dream and halluzination.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, will take place a weltwechsel instead, however, the reality is, in the imagination.
An intensive form of sinnstiftung and meaning in a precarious situation, the US people own gestaltungsfähigkeit possible, not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes to sink.
Everything is real, later in the memory
Also the devoted Peter art anthropologist Claussen describes his oneiroid-erlebnisse in his book "herzwechsel" as the bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his awareness after a herzklappenoperation, followed by a herztransplantation posted on travel, while his body in critical care for maintaining, is condemned.
Claussen, one in a selbstgeschaffene world, is visiting alien times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot watchdog over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs under nobles from blood.
A Greeks on the motorcycle abducted in its home country, surf with his spitalbett in firnschnee of the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is entirely at the imaginierten happen, everything is real, later in the memory.
These domestic travel for Claussen radically different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his day.
Quite the contrast to me are the memories from mental travel and even after years in minor details unambiguous.
Sharp and intensively even as truly erlebtes.
The intensity of this erlebens goes far beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience schmidt-degenhard says the psychiatrist.
Ultimately, oneiroide show, psychoses, hallucinations and drogenrausch how fragile our internal abbilder of external reality, are also on watch.
Any change of bewusstseinszustandes, summed the psychologist castes, "can lead to a verformung of what we call a reality."
An experience may also be enrichening.
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Children's publishing house with 27 years ago to accept
The new verlagschef Kallen is a stopgap Hubert Burda wants to be: in the long term, companies in the hands of his two children, he told the Mirror.
The holding will also in future have to 100 per cent of the family.
Hamburg - a publisher Hubert Burda, his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children, heirs of 27 years and I have the determination, to the companies, said the 69-jährige the mirror.
The details on this, we have taken the precaution of regulated.
The question of whether they are active in the company, only after.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
We cannot swallow his children 7 500 staff, if they are able not enough.
That brings the children and the company, too.
Burda asked on Thursday announced that he was withdrawing from January from the company ’ Kallen, and paul-bernhard appointed to his successor.
The 52-jährige Kallen Burda since 1999, when a member.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the area Treasury the responsibility for the unternehmensvermögen this and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer also the direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time is not a family member at the top of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serve on it, '10, 15 years, "according to Burda to bridge.
The holding should continue to 100 per cent of the family Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda that family business before the sinking are safe: "That was always families which can be contracted by a kapitalsucht quite verspekuliert, and felt that they could become so on the big player.
My strategy, this was never.
He had "never weltmachtträume" Burda that he had.
I am not as the political präzeptor of this country, as it Springer was, and I will also be a global player with 'time', a game these shops had become too big.
The promises of fonpeek
Peek äuβerst Limited is a machine with which you could only read his e-mails, without a chance to see some of the annexes to be able to surf the Internet or take.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, when it the magazine time to one of the products of the year.
It is on the straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea itself is still, particularly for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones peek cost very little and has a very favorable flat rate for example, just half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company, the success that has seen two new devices has come on the market: one, which is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong gratisservice for data, quite the contrary for peek, in which we pay six times higher price.
Yesterday fonpeek in the event Le Web been presented, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as its American counterpart, has, however, foresee a surprise.
The monthly unterhaltspreis for the phone in the month, about 12 euros, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who, with a smartphone travelling the world, already know what it means to all of the data to have to give up in order to be able to read the emails, as soon as you cross the border, or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi addiction (or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with FON).
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and really should have for a long time, be possible.
It is true that some of their objections specific contracts and prices already offer for auslandsaufenthalte, but in my experience, we need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, to be able to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming prices for the whole of Europe, almost always remained.
Auβerhalb of the country has always been afraid his emails to read and rightly so.
That a small device as fonpeek (although there is always amazing is that it has the name of FON, although there is no WiFi / WLAN does) this kind of tariffs can offer, means that their objections slowly, but surely, rethink and must start to consider various options in how they can use their Internet.
Kindle is a another good example, in his prizes is the downloaded of books and other questions are in the Internet.
Without vetrag and without snags.
This is a internetfähiges equipment, and it is paying only a single time, namely the buying and not month to month.
And this is precisely what I do one day, too fonpeek expect, a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong Internet access as it is, the Peek is already in the United States.
And this not because I intend to buy.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect that because I believe that there an appropriate model for the consumer would be.
It would be interesting, again with the same system of a computer, being able to see.
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
Amber is, without a doubt, the American first lady, the lieblingsfarbe.
It was the arrival of Barack Obama as president of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a veil of this colour and has the same colour and again, elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama, on both occasions borne very similar models: auβer that it is almost the same color, was a valid grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and cloak for the same clothing and she was wearing a little groβförmig gesticktes or a halskette.
It even goes as far as that the first sight seemed that the first lady of the United States, the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress in more than a cause of it.
However, distinguish the two clothes but much in the stoffart, from which they are made.
For the inauguration, you wore a dress from head and Oslo, including one from gemusterten.
The accessories were varied: At the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair style every time was different: the hair in this cause and upset haarkranz the previous, the hair open.
75% of working mothers, because of their maternity problems in the work get
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
To this result is the of CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women study by "fertility and career of women in Spain."
The poll of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their advancing their careers to the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study, frankly, that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and of the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work you.
Those of you who no other activity auβerhalb of the house, just halbtags work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women riding with a permanent jobs, especially in the public sector, and the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a firm joining their first child on average, only 3.7 years after the zusammenziehen, a number that has to 4.1 years for women with permanent jobs increased, which took longer to achieve this and their zusammenziehen and the first child to have completed until much later.
Auβerdem also has the type of work a groβen influence on the motherhood, albeit less than the calendars on the empfängnisbereitschaft, "explains the csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor, the age of the women in the marriage and with the first baby to be taken into account.
According to the survey is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group of between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are just the completed or a higher education, on average, each with 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time mother.
There is also still, depending on the level of education, a further difference between the women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before your first get married and have their first baby, make it the women with medium or high school that is precisely the other way round, and they look only a permanent employment and get married, and then after getting their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth
L Oréal Paris has recently its commonly beneideten list of botschafterinnen a new name added: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress, the image of different products and the brand is also the well-known advertising slogan "because they are worth it.
The hauptdarstellerin from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant schauspielerinnen at international level, will be another famous advertisement as before it, Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.

For men, the kosmetikfirma also only ausnahmebotschafter: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ´ s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (schauspielkollege of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry

On this occasion, they have all arrived.

The gamble of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent was presented in "play poker the Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the dreiβig röntgenbilder of writers that brought him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life), have accompanied.
In doing so, he used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes genre (kurzbiografie, live and work), but is looking for a änhlichkeit to the fervent heart of the creator.
The voyage is sensational and Vicent saves erleuchtungen yet neither of horror.
Auβer that this book a köstlicher lesegenuss is, too, it is a stirring incitement to read and always, read.
Here are a few ausschnitte from the book.
On Albert Camus when reading his side: "I found out that the Mediterranean no sea, but is rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous, just as I always have felt to have found it without words: the joy in contrast to the dire fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his brain, and between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense how the messerklinge, which nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was from this woman with a passion, the thirteen years dermaβen, thanks in its ranks, in their meat by the adultery, the emotions of the pleasure of remorse United, a spiritual privilege, it was in the sky on the face of the verderbens."
On James Joyce's "Ulysses," has 1922 in Paris issued by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit in global literature, it must be on the Nordwand hinaufklettern, on the wall, at the time and again and again, the best mountaineers try. "
On William Faulkner: "The was a peculiar Kauz.
He said sometimes of himself that it is the legacy of a gutsbesitzers County would be and others times, he said that he was the son of a black and a Krokodils would be.
Both dreams of a certain gröβe intercourse. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: the writers adopted the insane cry on, of a bridge from of those personality from Munich hinausgeschrieen, so that its response has been deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way out hallte. This made it on a trip, on which he fled from itself and, with a speech full of violence against the würmern anflehte posterity.
On Dorothy Parker: "One day, they kniete now and bettete: My dear God, I would ask you, do everything in your power to do if I am leaving, as a woman finally to write."
On Joseph Conrad: "on his grave, these verses of Spencer façade: 'the illusion the effort, / after the storm passes by the port, / the calm after the war, / For a Satten you like to live with the death."
On Virginia Wolf, "in her luggage, she had also always in their depression.
The husband has adopted it with utter normalcy, he said, if they for Eduard VII they between the azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.
It is not one other case where the man so much patience and in a neurotikerin was in love whose literary talent much gröβer as their twist. "
On Pío baroja: "What martín-santos otherwise made, than to try, Joyce's themes in baroja?
What intended because Benet, if he baroja not in the arms of Faulkner heranführte?
What made cela because, apart from the glory of that man to destroy themselves, so that he can ask at this rostrum? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70 years of mother went through our borough last week in the town of Fuenlabrada love as suddenly, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years, alongside her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling that we have brought in from the animal and of the just six kilos of weighs, and out of the blue, they lost him two fußtritte and injured him so that difficult.
Our indignation, one can never be in words, it is incomprehensible to us, where since the Spass in a cheap aggression against a small and hilfloses animal is to be, and it is obvious that it was carried out on the leash.
Added to that is the erstickungsanfall that a woman who was love comfortable than those who received because of the incident, they even wanted to reprimands to others feared their own lives, for if such a wahnsinniger a dog, he will be attacked at the same perhaps also with a woman, a child, an old Mr or probably even with any, of the weaker than he even is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet areas at 5 p.m. on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon.
The dog has geheult all day long.
Of course we have in a nahgelegenen Football Intelligence Unit reported, but we have yet to receive serious doubts about whether that will lead to anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the very beginning that we would like to make it clear that, just like the vicious gangster Spaniard goods.
Our outrage over what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what in the minds of the young people that you have to do a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal to find fun on an animal that we love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education, and the respect for the animals and the people are.
Michelin and fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs especially in the younger motorcyclists are today launched announcement from both companies.
This initiative is to on the importance of the helmgebrauchs out, because this is ultimately about the only subject that schutzelement clubbed or even death in the case of a motorradunfalls able to prevent.
Michelin pointed out that the campaign is part of its commitment to safety, "the far more covers than just the design and manufacture of products that are safer with every day" and reaffirmed that they will continue with other actions educational and informative character contribute to this goal every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the helmgebrauchs on the motorcycle, the under the slogan 'to be or not to be' going on, in a first phase, about 500 motorradwerkstätten distribute posters in the bestmöglichste spread.
To conclude said Michelin, that the road safety a "constant anxiety" of the company, and for precisely the reason that, as producers of tyres for obliges zwei-rädige vehicles always see that one of your main objectives the development of increasingly safer products to be.
The sale of kleinlastwagen is rising again to something
After almost two years discrepancies within the beginning of the end for kleintransporter a little light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase from 12.6% in relation to the year 2008 and, more importantly, you are in the first growth for 22 consecutive months at all keep going with decline, gemäβ the herstellerverband Anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam's figures.
Those good numbers, however, are in time to genieβen only with groβer caution, because the comparison seem by November 2008 other, which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year was.
However, we must remember that, aside from the rise in the past month, the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months, is still 40 per cent below the sale of the previous financial year.
Since January, total 95.853 vehicles sold, at this number, but all vehicles, from which the kleintransportermarkt is, contain: descendants of cars, pick-ups, kleintransporter, small vans and lighter kleinlastwagen / chassis.
Besides are still the same storm clouds in the sky that the demand affected by most of all, because even though a few of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the groβteil of the sales to small and medium-sized companies, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a drittfinanzierung Belgium.
We should have one of these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten geldhahns of the banking institutions, with einschlieβen other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this landscape and unlike the cars, have the financial aid for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little helped.
This plan, however, is intended not only to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right, if you are a kleintransporter up to 3.5 tonnes, with a co2-ausstoss not 160 grams per gefahrenen kilometres may exceed want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had again ganvam remembered that there are necessarily needed by the state, is also a special attention to these kleinlaster, and, of course, to the industriefahrzeuge (trucks and buses).
The autohändlervereinigung predicts for 2010 is a similar year as last, for which it with a verkaufsausfall (in passenger cars and SUVs) of 19 per cent ahead.
The support in bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was already in the antiblockierbremssystem abs and how it just happens with the stability control control (ESC, the hilfssysteme on the brakes in an emergency situation in the European cars a pflichtausstattung.
In fact, you have a duty to all newly registered cars and light kleintransportern, for the rest of the vehicles, a karenzfrist set by the end of February 2011.
Agreed by the European Union maβnahme aims, to improve protection of the fuβgänger, however, because of her working methods, these braking systems can also help to prevent many front-rear collisions could.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers use the system, the driver on the bremspedal bremsstärke outlined recognizes.
This system, however, is not that pressure by the closure.
According to a dated komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge Research, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the zusammenstoss nothing more to it, to come to the bremspedal and half of them had not slowed down at full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The bremshilfe, by contrast, resorts with maximum force in the braking by a and reduced the bremszeit and hence the bremsabstand the bremsvorgang a car, the truck.
According to a study by the EU each year could be up to 1,100 fatal accidents, where fuβgänger come to harm, be prevented if all cars with this kind of notbremsassistenten were equipped.
It would be even less accidents, it is reckoned that each fourth accident involving personal injury, could be prevented, once the so-called intelligent measures to be popular.
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system, the (on radar or a camera) obstacles recognises and the driver, and there had been warning the same time, a light pressure on the brakes.
Then, if the driver responded him the system, helps the pressure on the bremspedal, if it is to increase would be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the zusammenstoss already is unavoidable, does the bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes to this sense of the damage as low as possible.
General Motors defers the plan for Opel to January
While the workforce of the opel-werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), by Nick Reilly as the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first aprilwoche, likely will start on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturers to point out that he needs more time to accommodate the rescue plan for Opel to the conclusion.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will in fact get the affected side of your agreement with each item of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it might be that the final document, which first proposed the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, to be submitted by early 2010, will move.
Dementgegen was suspended from GM said that it will make a decision in the next few days on the sale of Saab meeting.
Given that, it is not surprising that the Swedish government to put pressure on the American industry has increased so that a decision is made as soon as possible.
GM exists, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of those buyers would like to be Geely, which also wanted to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the skyper-sportwagen, the Russian group, has converg backing to becoming more fit.
If there are none of these shoppers should come to an agreement, GM's assets to the Chinese BAIC some sell.
The decision, Saab the end of the year, if it until then schlieβen not have been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive juwels engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and made it really, however, take him to make it easier for 80 kilograms and he is now only 1.275 kilo on the scales.
In order to create such a thing, the first thing you do not support the automatic aufklappbare roof, a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem drive was replaced, so that just one has 21 kilo; thanks saved in this model aluminiumtüren used as the GT3 'disappearance "further 15; by the exclusion of the air conditioning unit still time 13; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank of 64 to 54 litre of winding down with further 7 kilo to have been saved by the installation and athletic bacquet-sitzen nor times 12, and with the light 19-zoll-felgen five, saved again.
Then, it was also due to the audio-system cdr-30 again six kilos less and the exchange of türgriffe by griffe from substance reached the lack of kilo.
Although it also is available with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK, the probefahrt with a vehicle with handgetriebe 6-gängigen carried out, mainly on the smaller landstraβen of California, on bergstrecken, the really very kurvig.
In his style of driving, you can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of his weight, but not this geführtdass he is now no longer so sure on the straβe would be.
Rather, the opposite is the case: for long, we have not more so small and light model probegefahren, this one but also a sense of groβer security at the bends, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of it, its muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm, until we give him the orders to mow, to boot, to recover and then all over again from its engine to get out...
He is doing everything he says. The car is doing, what we are up to it with our hands on the steering wheel indicate, thanks to its control, the equally kommunikativ as precise.
And he is doing it with the precision of a surgeon who.
A motorsound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and we can still make it with the 'sports' -option and by means of a system that can change the motorgeräusche already on the Panamera, which for the first time to be adopted.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is unbelievably brutal, regardless of whether from the face of the renewed speed up or out.
The federungen are strong, but not hard or obstinate.
The asphalt on the landstraβen where we are with the Boxster Spyder aboard, was already pretty damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps good.
The electronic assistants on the whole route had virtually nothing to do; and that, although we have some of these graphs ice at the crack of dawn and rollsplitt were held in the morning.
In summary, it a ultraleichtes car is, a car, with which it has an indescribable fahrspass, as it will otherwise have rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car in February 2010 will come on to the market and 70.831 euros.

The baskonia pays a victory in Israel itself
The Caja Laboral story, in spite of the many popular players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, a magnificent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex fuβballfeld of the Maccabi Electra and thus ends up in the first place in its group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza teletovic, with eight triple the best of his team was (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria, the significant shortfalls of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or micov by a very broad sense of commitment and team work, even if you replaced until the bitter end to its victory muβten wait.
The great pull out from the perimeter, with 16, valued triple contributed maβgeblich on her final victory.
The game started with the leadership of the blauroten right from the start at the anzeigentafel to the top.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria from the perimeter already were already out, one could guess that you on to the pitch, with good handgelenken aufgewärmten.
It was English and teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was little different, except that the team out for a innenseitiges game models from Barac, and for the balance of Eliyahu, in his return to the team with pfiffen and applause was received that his home is in order to further their advantage before the break expanding (34-43).
Teletovic began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, including wennn highlight the "minus six" evaluation of the splinter been lieβen guess is that this is not the best night of brasilianers would be.
Nevertheless, it was the game despite the clear advantage in the interval not yet been decided and the makkabäer wanted the vitorianer also remind you that, on a pitch not everybody wins, and you the always prepared "hand of Elías" they came into the game back.
Eidson and pnini contributed central to ensuring that the 'yellow' the helm umdrehten (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had to prepare a few spielzüge with accuracy, in order to get back on air and in one of them, suddenly the pistol of Mirza teletovic, with three nearly successive triple and with the support of English and Ribas to ensure that once again on the anzeigentafel einberuhigender distance of (54-67) was reported by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) has been able to give.
The alavesen last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they would allow anyone to give them the victory they are in the first dreiβig minutes honestly deserved, being taken away again.
Nonetheless resigned pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, and your team is not trying again by three points from the line (70-77) force.
In spite of this, and although Mote because of fouls called by the room, the team of Ivanovic was not to be defended well and even though the Israelis nor in the last minute of aufholten (80-85), had the game already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

The team from neither fear had Melilla has suffered the mood in the Hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, perhaps the one of the strongest in Europe and a lot of money.
What, thanks to its game in first quarter were the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive verteidung and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blendete the hosts with 12-18-month in the ninth minute.

The Greek team at last began to be warm, and his superiority on both spielhälften, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland because of a breach and the three itself a mistake caused by Carlos Jiménez at the Unicaja hinterlieβen a strong impression.
Among their players in the innenfeld and the Lithuanian vorspieler Linas kleizas, with his triple, increased their advantage at 44-32 in the 19th minute.
A aufholjagd was impossible

Thank you!
After the verlockendsten days since last spring, at which the inflation of the assets the prevailing mood in the markets was, is on the markets and again returned to the insecurity, and certainly not surprising, since this is their natural state is, in an environment in which the broker decisions on a inherently uncertain future.
The stabilisation of the markets maβnahme was applied to the debt with the direktkauf of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly to allow free hand in interest rates to zero, so that in this way to persuade the banks buy assets to the claim.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as good as finished, and that without their heterodox policy to liquidity into question, puts begin to spread as the BCE already näc vormachte with their jahresversteigerung, the next week.
That is why the investors doubt about the ability of the global economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox maβnahmen alive and we are currently witnessing a reversal of the reduction in the risk premiums.
The flüchtigkeiten of the stock markets and the differences in unternehmensboni are rising again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts that you achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to seek to nationalize the private risks and the national debt is rising again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the main sanctuary of the investors, which in turn will help to increase the differences of the eurozone countries in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now barely been affected by this episode of instability, but then came in the Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision to the bottom in terms of the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, not to a degree of uncertainty is damaging the defenders of moral risk to silence tried again, with the leaders of the policy-making an awareness, for what had caused it, because they have to produce the devastating effects, which include the restriction of credit has led to the loss of jobs than they really had, slowed down a new day for the dankesaktion had beschlieβen.
Nonetheless, it is indicative of what happened in Dubai on a stammeskrieg between the emiren out for power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece, it was also an earlier forecast.
A government, which the public debt, glosses elections and a new government, which draws on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary earlier this year of not fulfilling its auslandszahlungen save, and therefore a euro-mitgliedsland credit for, to fulfil its obligations not longer.
Meanwhile, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with, at the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are, as expected, in an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some lending to large sums of money, and it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, it is not to worry, as long as the differences of the national debt to deal with the same speed as the European unternehmensboni increase.
However, the European differences should be minimised and the Spanish further dannn would increase, this is a special Spanish risk act.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators forcing a groβteil the marktforschungsinstitute their scenarios for the recovery and preferable scenario for 2011 to be revised upwards, einschlieβlich the OCDE and the European Commission, the back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy of production, promises to be all this despite warnings not a long life span.
Once again, it has quite the appearance that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares may, although at the moment "of caution when driving" is the order of the day.

The last four have 1.4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, the 5.2 million.
So you get a fuβballclub at least 7,1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, deserved, with his victory in the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, to make the variable payments, for the 337,8 million.
This money will be calculated according to the value of each individual fernsehmarkts missed.
The Spanish, is among the first and, 4 allotted seats.
The master of last year gets 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the drittplatzierte and 10% for the fourth seat.
