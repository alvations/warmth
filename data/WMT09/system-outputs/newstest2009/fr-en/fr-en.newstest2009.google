At the end of trade, the Prague stock market turned negative in the 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectify its losses. 
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half the usual daily. 
Tuesday, the early exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange returned to his fall from the previous day, when it lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the decrease is due to the fall in Wall Street shares. 
The opposite market reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to approve the plan to stabilize the U.S. financial sector, is also visible among us. 
Falling shares in Asia 
The Asian bourses Tuesday lived a dramatic fall, although the indices managed during the day, erasing some of the losses. 
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange of Hong Kong lost four percent during trade, but later it erases a part of the losses and reduces the decline to nearly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises following the movement of shares of Chinese Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, markets are closed in Shanghai. 
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but finally we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent. 
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent. 
"The hesitancy about the rescue of the U.S. influence financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong currency board. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, establishes its monetary policy itself, ie independently of the central bank of China. 
Interest rates in Hong Kong the same level as in the USA. 
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal supports the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk that other countries suffer the effects. 
The bloodbath in U.S. 
Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, which would have had to spend up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 bilions of CZK). 
Legislators renièrent and supports the call for a draft of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
The U.S. lived, Monday, a bloodbath and the main index of shares suffered the largest drop in the past 20 years. 
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent have experienced a drop of this magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress gave the U.S. government may inject $ 700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader agreement for financial assistance to U.S. financial system. 
It will be submitted to a vote early next week. 
U.S. legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the talks on adopting a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance amounting to 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion crowns) paid to U.S. financial system . 
Success is not safe. 
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit to the vote, the congressman must complete a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan supports the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday at Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the banking and financial regulations of the House. 
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid contracts can be effective, follow a "disenchantment". 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
We met our divergent views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilize the market, "confided to the Bloomberg Agency Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to her, the final vote could be conducted from Sunday. 
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, representatives of legislators met the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, to give the Government a substantive final form. 
He should buy from financial companies, real estate unsaleable assets that lead companies in financial losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety. 
"We are about to come to an agreement on a plan that will work and which must be also effective on the market. 
We still need to continue this recovery plan markets, but I think we're at it, "said Paulson. 
A signal to Asian trade 
The worldwide financial crisis has considerable impact on stock markets to fall. 
According n'évadiez Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are so that the Congress would lead to a definitive agreement as soon as Sunday. 
They want to appease investors before the start of trade on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect trade on Monday. 
But for now, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of Congress voting, or if the negotiations are unlikely to remain blocked at the last minute by a particular problem. 
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted during the coming days. 
However, the law will still many changes. 
The total for using the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion dollars, as he wished President George Bush, should be available as soon as possible. 
But if the Congress will feel that the program does not fulfill its function, it can block the granting of the remaining amount, following two stages: first $ 100 billion, and then, finally, 350 billion dollars. 
Mr. Bush hailed progress in the negotiations 
Although the president can veto that decision, Congress, he has the opportunity to put it in the minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate, whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to vote on the law, and the Senate Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
U.S. President George Bush himself is happy with the progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was happy with the progress made Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Limiting golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, taxpayer protection against losses, the abatement agreement and the progress of plan the time axis. 
The new law also restrict those golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will monitor the fund. 
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and to all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also provides for property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new installments in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing monthly debtors and allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: A psychological 
According to the head of Patria Finance economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult. 
"And that is because we do not know what the mechanism and the price of buying assets from problems. 
This point will be crucial to decide on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and government, "said Marek, this week to server iHNed.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important. 
"It is much more important that the congressman come to an agreement this week, they support this plan and they devote as soon as possible. 
The psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, most important at this time, "said Marek. 
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles. 
We will advise you how to choose 
While virtually all mobile can read MP3 files, MP3 player does not know call. 
It seems clear result that it is better to buy just a phone. 
Still there are sufficient grounds to obtain an independent reader. 
The choice depends entirely on how to use and requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy the house for a gramophone expensive high-end to put the new album Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such products do not leave music on vinyl and, in terms of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen. 
Or, if your shelves stacked vinyl, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably at least dream of such a gramophone. 
The same is true of music for travel, namely music compressed, to say the simple - the music to MP3. 
Again, there are categories on the basis of price and quality. 
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight miles crowns for a drive, just like a fan of Pink Floyd would have trouble supporting headphones bought for twenty crowns to the market. 
These are two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is wide. 
The battery life is also crucial 
Some music players upmarket are capable of much more than simply playing music, but it is unknown functions, of course, the most mobile. 
No current device is as universal as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it can play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and may, for example, until to be used for navigation. 
And if we take into account Smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Since no fridge knows grill meat and no television will not take photographs, we see almost a miracle. 
But the universality of mobile is not without drawbacks. 
The more functions you use, the greater the interval between reloading will be reduced. 
And playing music is one of Goinfre largest energy. 
Mobiles are rare who are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower. 
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient. 
In the case of mobile cheap, they will play the music for a few hours. 
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, obtain, to be sure, a second charge for the work - and this applies even for more expensive equipment. 
Se problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, following a reload of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient. 
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, a limited part of the apparatus has a USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software. 
One can, of course, record music directly onto the memory card, but few card readers know to do it without reduction, given the tiny size of memory cards used in mobile phones. 
Regarding readers, you need except (iPod), no software. 
Simply fill out, through the USB connector, the unit of music from the computer. 
Most mobile and readers will create their own media library classified according to the name of the artist, title of the album, style, or after the trial of the user. 
Some devices do an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Readers are easier to handle, more mobile know-how 
In choosing a concrete, you especially interested in the life of the battery, the capacity of memory, quality and type of its output and, of course, with ease of command. 
If music is for you, essentially, a noise and if that day you will listen only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just read any mobile MP3. 
Virtually all mobile are now capable of. 
You do not even obliged to do too much attention to music formats that the motive or the drive can read. 
All come to play MP3 and the vast majority of music that will reach you just have this format. 
It is one of the most common and share it, the vast majority of devices coming to read the WMA music format. 
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its firm iPods), it is less common. 
The high-end mobiles also, for example, purchasing music online. 
Simply visit from the mobile phone, the website of the operator (or those of another vendor) and buy the corresponding song or album in question. 
This alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile music. 
The offer operators is miserable and unfortunately it is limited in most cases, to radio tubes fast facts. 
The prices are not lower. 
However, it is generally agreed that the way to buy music (whether by mobile phone, Internet or via the Internet wirelessly) dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people always on their mobile home. 
Whenever you want to hear something, you simply leave the motive for your pocket, then you do not remember your MP3 player at home. 
It is also important if you are still on your headphones or a handsfree connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the speakers that have virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price. 
The cheaper cost normally less than three thousand. 
For a price of three four miles crowns can be a very suitable walkman. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of regular output for headphones. 
The price of better phones and better equipped, also provided an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand. 
Readers, for against, have the advantages of having easy. 
Really anyone arrives at the command of the most rudimentary readers - who are not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions and likeness of the command with that of a cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision as a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by an invoice data transmission immense. 
Choose which device 
Even the cheapest mobile (eg. The Vodafone 527) have usually a slot for memory cards exchanged (type M2, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two miles crowns. 
But be careful. 
The basic models can argue that the cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive fare even with memory cards of 8 GB. 
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, Samsung, a Emgeton or a iriver. 
Depending on the capacity (max 2 GB), you do not spend more than 1 100 kronor. 
If you're one of the most demanding listeners, choose rather specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and some Samsung). 
These aircraft are equipped with independent command buttons for MP3, and thus the prosperity of the command approximates that of an independent MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile walkman series have the same menu that users of MP3 players sold separately, one that has gone furthest in this area. 
The same service in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the battery (typically 15 hours, up to 35 hours) above, is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator win the Czech Republic this year itself. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may not fail for a long time. 
We have already mentioned repeatedly on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The CTU (The Czech Telecommunications Office), who reported that the price of an SMS was higher at home than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed. 
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper only in the country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple: It lacks a competition that would really go into combat. 
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three networks and a mobile penetration exceeds 100%. 
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
In this, Pavel Dvorak, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), which has repeatedly stated that the Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, is chorus with operators. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network apparently has much chance (indeed, now, it would find it difficult frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market which resulted in a decline in prices, which were subsequently, also react operators classic. 
Yet even before the entry of spoilers such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today among us suggested in Great Britain. 
However, it appeared that there was a place for such operators and could have a real success. 
We are also not obliged to look too far to find examples. 
In February we had informed the launch in Poland, the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months, this operator has managed to gain over 100 thousand clients and become the fifth operator in the country. 
Also, behind the Mobilking there is the financial group Penta, which owns among other U: fon in Czech Republic. 
The advantage of virtual operators are able to focus on a target far more concrete. 
For that to function effectively, they indeed need a lot fewer customers a classical operator. 
They are indeed free of costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the mobile network, relatively high. 
Thus, in the world, the virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators - they offer calls and SMS cheap, which is often countered by offering limited services. 
For example Tesco Mobile, Great Britain, SMS messages at least twice cheaper than its competitors. 
But as the example of Mobilking Poland, focus on a target group unusual can also be a good publicity coup. 
Indeed, this operator is so specific men. 
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator who they like and which they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say if such a concept could also walk among us. 
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, questioned: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, which is based on the most virtual operators. 
Moreover it is relatively saturated in terms of providing services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators 
It seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, will not Mobilking. 
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successful, but Czech negotiations are not promoters. 
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area, "said in a telephone maintains Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta. 
It has indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were in any case not support this idea. 
Instead, they try to do everything possible to a potential competitor can appear. 
The group GTS Novera, which would thus take a step again to become a real competitor Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, do not hide, for quite some time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunication services, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we managed to progress in the negotiations, "said the spokesperson Pavel Kaidl. 
The future may therefore be promising. 
According to unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence. 
"Right now we do not there is space on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is compared with other very specific. 
At the moment, no matter with a serious and complex project in this area has not contacted us, "said Vlastimil Srsen department press Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz. 
Other operators are also related to the specificity of the Czech market. 
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2 statement: "We have not registered for the project viable and beneficial bilaterally, which could serve as a base." 
And she adds: "It is virtually ruled out a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time so limited, we should now have a concrete agreement. " 
Vodafone rather directs his attention to fulfilling requests for its own 3G license. 
Miroslav Čepický said compared to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of infrastructure and shared costs. 
That is what we believe, means more inputs from the perspective of customers. 
The main strategy for Vodafone in this area is finding a partner to establish a network for fast mobile Internet. " 
The authorities responsible: in line with operators 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition would have led to lower prices and thus lower their profits. 
What would therefore facilitate the achievement of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, operators are understood as thieves at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U: fon also demonstrated. 
The greatest pressure on the CTU apparent during the creation of the U: fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile. 
Demonstrated publicly available information from the web pages of CTU. 
Today, U: fon lends itself serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "The competition in the mobile market has been more recently amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of a player additional submission, and especially its services to high standards. " 
But given the attitude that mobile operators here, the indifference of regulators Czech seem disconcerting. 
This does not only the attitude of ČTÚ which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in economic competition. 
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS). 
But it passed, faced with this problem, its typical position. 
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between an operator and mobile virtual operator in question concerning the location of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such agreement has been reached yet because the supply of interested potential has not presented a priori enough interest for operators classic, "said in response to our question Kristian Chalupa Department External Relations of ÚOHS. 
A statement made and does not surprise from representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and also between other care, that nobody takes advantage of its market position, such a statement is more than confusing. 
Especially as Kristian Chalupa adds: "When abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that they have entered the market contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services." 
Or, put pressure towards the honest operation of the market and lower prices apparently does not interest ÚOHS. 
What is indeed shocking, is almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question whether this is really a chance arises naturally. 
In the same way a price of petrol strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard struggle of competition. 
"The office has not identified in this regard, signs of a anticompétitif behavior, he has no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore has no responsibility corresponding increase in its market. 
The necessary tools for market opening to mobile virtual operators probably lacking even the regulator of telecommunications, "said in his statement boats. 
The interpretation of the dominant market position is one of many points of contention. 
Of course, there is a relevant market analysis prepared by the CTU that telecom is, in terms of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in this market. 
However, some law experts offer a different vision of things: that the creation of a virtual operator is possible, we should get, every time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically monopoly on its network. 
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its business. 
But even without admitting that argument, it should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS three mobile operators visibly carry a similar manner. 
Yet the complaints of many parties (including the company GTS Novera already mentioned) show they face in negotiations with all operators of similar constraints. 
Making the responsibility back on a tour ČTÚ is fairly common in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes his hands of the case. 
We have already experienced this kind of attitude in several cases. 
It has unfortunately failed to pass in the novelization of the Telecommunications Act, recently adopted an expansion of powers of ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of ÚOHS should very well know, but their interests are apparently other. 
When nobody watching, it may work 
However, the operation of a sort of pseudo virtual operators, many in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
These are companies posting their own list price of mobile telephone services, but these are only partly public. 
In most cases, it is question of firms involved in multi-level marketing. 
Mobile phone services are offered particularize eg Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others. 
The price lists of these firms generally do than elected. 
The magic trick is that the company before the transaction is a classic client company, which commands a large quantity of SIM cards. 
As a customer, it gets quotes (and other) forces. 
The problem is that the conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale. 
"If it happens that you mention it could be a transgression of contractual terms that we would consider, and could lead to a stop in collaboration with the company in question," responded to our question on Martina Kemrová this problem. 
However, it is quite unlikely that echo such activity could not reach officials to mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of three companies listed there may be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, yet no action be taken against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these companies make their profits non-negligible, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický indicates possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a significant percentage of customers. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card into their phone is not registered in their name, they can not dispose fully, like ordinary customers of mobile operators. " 
But that is precisely who should seem strange to CTU. 
Moreover, there is another issue to ÚOHS. 
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be noted that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if he does not wish to rely on explanations of operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contract terms prohibiting . 
When we are not the most expensive 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has brought a decline in the price of services. 
However, in virtually all countries where traders appeared virtual operators tried conventional, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by them were virtually the same - a market too small or too full, problems with the quality of services. 
It is precisely at this level that have occurred in developed countries, regulatory bodies, not defending the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers. 
Both formal measures by informal pressure, they eventually get the first creation of a virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators to address this issue like a hot potato which gets rid while transmitting a target near. 
Following the experiences we have, we can not get rid of the impression that the confusion in their skills in these cases is more than profitable. 
But do not let the handle after the ax. 
Whether backstage say information and a true virtual operator will soon be home, the Czech mobile market will perhaps moving. 
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will be difficult to remain impassive face of rejection (of discrimination) others. 
And we may continue to draw more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday, the Day of Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov Můj (Where is my homeland?). 
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiri Belohlavek. 
We have four versions - with a song solo male or female, with a choir and an instrumental version. 
The singing is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymn arrangements. 
You can listen to four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national music as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he had previously given Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret versions of solo singers with voices young and representative, which are marked and appreciated. 
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that both singers and the chorus, have good diction, so that we understand the words they sing the same time," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year, its 175th anniversary. 
The song sounds Kde domov Můj for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské Theater (Theater states) in Fidlovačka (Fair of shoemaker), original Czech Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music František Škroup. 
It became popular and people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the establishment of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse became a natural part of the national anthem. 
He remained one of seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic. 
How to ring the "new" anthem 
Public transport (MHD) introduce Prague, Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be recorded in history Pražský Dopravní podnik Agency (Prague Transport) as the date rise in the metro, trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will be in their pocket electronic coupon. 
At the moment, it is accessible to almost hundred thousand people, owners of the smart card Opencard. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1st January 2009) and the time to register on their smart card in the information and the offices of Dopravní podnik (l Agency Transport), located in subway stations Muzeum and Mustek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kacerov and Luka. 
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying the coupons via the internet on web pages Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning. 
Those who begin to use the online store can forget a definitive ATMs in subway stations, where they had hitherto walked impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets. 
Indeed, they buy their coupon on the Internet and store it on their card Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (libraries). 
"In these contact points, it is available to the passenger window with trained personnel to assist stakeholders with the purchase via the Internet and also record the coupon they bought on their card," says Spokesman Martin Opatrny project. 
Besides the libraries will also be recorded on the electronic coupons Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several subway stations. 
What do these distributors? 
They are red, say the machines compost tickets and passengers may have already noticed in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská. 
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be four-twenty," said Opatrny. 
An automatic coupon in place of driver 
The robots that will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
Simply introducing the smart card and coupon Opencard previously purchased will register itself on the map. 
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city. 
Namely in suburban trains and bus lines 300 and 499, used mainly residents of towns in central Bohemia to reach the capital. 
"In trains integrated Pražská Integrovaná doprava (integrated transport in Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, through which they establish the validity and zonal temporary coupons," said Filip tickets control of Drapal ROPID organization, which designs the public transport timetables Prague. 
The suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the body of the driver. 
When boarding it is necessary not only to show the smart card driver, but we must also place the Opencard to the place indicated on the side of the box. 
Thus, the driver checks the validity of coupons registered. 
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of coupons saved, there is nothing easier than to request this information to the driver," Drapal completed. 
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and does not recall the date of expiry of the validity of their coupon, can join again vending machines, initially used to store coupons on the map. 
That, on the device display that will display information about the validity of their document. 
The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the USA 
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be incorporated in the United States. 
This follows a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská Vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia). 
If we can not be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the management of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed to the president of USA with such a desire. 
This follows among other a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská Vědecká knihovna. 
German Cesky Krumlov pray in the letter the American president not to allow "Šumavská Župa" (area of forest in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - either visited Czechoslovakia. 
"We understand the situation and really want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are on German territory, not enemies and oppressors, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, in which the fate the Šumava takes to heart. " 
Since the rally in Czechoslovakia was allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, without regard to attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urging the president U.S. to take his hands in the Protectorate of Bohemia for now and forever. 
"We do not believe that you give this territory to a foreign state to us, and destroyed that oppresses minorities and has not contributed to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of a quarter million residents , "Is written in the letter. 
The alleged reason why the authors can not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge "Czech oppressors". 
If the president of USA doubted the opinion of Germans in Bohemia, it would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live employers in the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter may, in light of current knowledge of the history of post-war, seem somewhat naive, some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time. 
While the Czech Germans were at least promise that their expulsion of the Republic arise, very few of them Is such a possibility. 
Some waited as the United States and Britain would get for a certain type Sudeten autonomy. 
Others believed they simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this. 
During the war, it was, as a České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries. 
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the camp to capture the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to view their learning Czech. 
"They believed that once they return home, the Czech would be beneficial," said Chalupa. 
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war did, he said, that following the Benes decrees, he would be expelled from the republic. 
You do not think - you pay! 
An emotional campaign attack drivers 
Efforts road safety the most expensive in Czech history. 
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport. 
The Office of the Minister Aleš Řebíček believes it will discourage drivers of unsafe behavior behind the wheel. 
The campaign cost 150 million appear on television, radio, film, Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers driving fast and drunk driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before you start. 
She especially wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, including professional drivers. 
What appear in the spots? 
Mostly personal stories that will attack the emotions. 
This is also demonstrated by the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign: 
You do not think - you pay! 
The phrase "You do not think" is written in capital letters on the license plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You paieras." 
What should symbolize that we can pay to life a moment of inattention. 
The spots will "haunt" the audience until 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxons, where you can see pictures with images of victims of severe accidents. 
He believes that this will result in a decrease in accidents and fatalities on Czech roads. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers 
"What works with drivers, it is the sugar and whip. 
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by virtue of saving time, when grillent a red light. 
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks must be reminded drivers, "said Martin Koran, the psychologist transport of Na Homolce hospital. 
Thus we need information campaigns in the press and mostly negative ads, says psychologist. 
The danger signs are drivers, he said, already less effective. 
"When a static panel warns against danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers do not observe more," reported Koran. 
Olmert would make for peace almost all occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the chairman of the Provisional Government of Israel, spoke in favor of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including therefore the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
He made this declaration in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), or all," Olmert told the daily. 
"We keep a certain percentage of land, but we will sell the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israel), because without it, peace will not happen," he added. 
He admitted that restitution can include East Jerusalem. 
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially do not want tractors and bulldozers to crush the feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will relinquish parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noticed referring to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the Prime Minister will need to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred places and historical" located inside the Old City. 
"Whoever would maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, "he says thereafter. 
Retreat from the Golan Heights 
Olmert also spoke in favor of Israel retreat from the Golan Heights, which according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," reported there. 
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan. 
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran, they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement), they will have to abandon the constant grant supports terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement) of Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "said the premier. 
Questions that arise after the accident in the Stewards because they are illegal? 
The law ignores walk in a car long distance is prohibited 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers during the journey can move inside the bus. 
"If we wanted to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which a hostess died aged 22, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck which crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was unfortunately at this time sitting beside the driver, based on the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
However, the coach can have an accident or a sudden halt, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical description equipped with standing or not. 
If this equipment is not standing approved, passengers must remain seated. 
The long distance buses Student Agency does not have standing, which was confirmed by the aktualne.cz director of the company Radim Jančura. 
"This is an issue we have dealt with the ministry and at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they canceled and we got that passengers can go to the bathroom during the trip provided they have their own seat, "he unveiled his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement does that role. 
On the other hand, no legal requirement does not the carrier to offer services. 
The law on road transport only knows the term receiver vehicle, but does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles, said, however, that the law sufficiently addresses the issue. 
"Everything depends on whether the coach's approval has permission to offer standing room. 
All lies there, "he said. 
Buses are divided into cities, where there is standing room and a top speed limited distance with standing room and a higher speed and long distance buses without standing up with the maximum speed allowed the highest and seats equipped with safety belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Horin, an expert at BESIP (road safety) in transport security, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem. 
"At a regular flow, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft. 
Again, it is not sure when to produce a turbulence and the stewardess can bump your head. " 
"But if the coach would have slowed so sudden, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
Just as in a city bus or a tram. 
The carrier must manage security stewards by internal requirements, "he says and believes that in terms of the law, the issue is not resolved. 
Jančura is ready to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier to offer bus services stewards. 
He hired two hundred. 
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their work as a profession at risk. 
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky business, I will delete it. 
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper to board. 
This would reduce costs too, "he said. 
The concern for security is the reason given the lack of stewards in its vehicles director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, which, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines. 
"We have no hostesses. We are opposed from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident, "he said, years ago, at Týden.cz. 
A great tragedy has come 
A young hostess in the region of Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian truck probably quité the emergency lane without using flashing and he blocked the way to the bus. 
The driver of the latter to try to avoid using a sudden maneuver, but it was close by his right side. 
Jančura denied that the two seats reserved for the rest of stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked." 
The company complaint against the truck driver. 
Compensation for the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but for financial compensation, it also relies on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
An amendment to the law, which is being developed for over a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide information about the movement of stewards on board the bus. 
"But it did not lead to any conclusion on this point. 
Indeed, it is not interested too bus, but the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and use of portable driving, "said the expert Horin. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards as something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," concluded the spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the safety of buses is under the power of Police and the Office for safety. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words no shortage in the letter addressed by the Steering Committee of WestLB employees home. 
By a union of entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution's capital markets financial group Sparkasse" could occur, according to the letter made public Monday. 
WestLB would make a "block of competence coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive kick to other mergers in the banking sector of the Länder. 
Here is how this looks when the Executive Committee wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Car WestLB wounded, still suffers great pressure. 
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Supervisory Authority of Financial Services which it only recently made it clear the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was counted in the search a future solution. 
It is, however, question for some time now - as the side of Frankfurt - a relationship of any kind between the bank Deka, who knows customers of the Sparkasse through their fund investments, and WestLB. 
While the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported when presenting the figures of the semester in late August he saw no sense in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB. 
However, the board of Deka, each of which half is borne by banks and Land and groups of savings banks, instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with WestLB to common business . 
It could be the flow of financial market, or parts thereof. 
The talks come just begun, however, say in the financial sector. 
This is not the first time the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the financial center of Frankfurt, comes into play is lorqu'il question of consolidating the sector savings banks. 
In 2003 it was thought for a moment that Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab. 
Nothing is yet emerged from this ternary bouquet. 
Just the plans had been made public that the government of Hesse ruled against any involvement in the Hellaba them. 
Thereafter, the two other houses does not rejoignèrent not. 
The bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to replace the bank of Baden-Wüttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were always new negotiations on the reunification of the Deka-Bank with banks Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of the Hellaba, however, had decided against any strategy of merging with its bank. 
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the consolidation of various public sector institutions is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election in parliament of Bavaria rose, a union of BayernLB with the bank of Baden-Wüttenberg could be realized in the first. 
For Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure that requires further mergers would increase potential partners to escape slowly. 
In the South, it would become a junior partner, although it has so far resisted better to the crisis than banks in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The group savings and transfers of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, has instead fired a bolt at the beginning of any union with WestLB. 
Remain at the rigor NordLB. 
Such geo-strategic thinking does, however, that facet. 
Another facet raises the question of how the various models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the crucial question, namely through what model the future ability of banks of the Länder should be ensured, had not been previously resolved by the German Savings Banks and transfers. 
Eventually, a carving of WestLB could take place here dépeçage which is obviously not desirable. 
It is also mentioned in the letter from the Executive Committee in place: in any case would be referred to a "comprehensive solution" for the institution. 
How all this will be in the same basket with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is also known as the weekend of Italian. 
For Elena is the first time for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies as a girlfriend, and therefore nothing is the same, he said. 
Behind them, nearly one Barrel of five liters of beer brand Kaiser, is holding a bearded well built, which shows about 200 visitors to the Oktoberfest what it sounds deep throat can produce. 
Elena Luca tape first, then kisses. 
In Bologna, they came to Verona. 
From there, the bus station near the station Puorta nueva, four buses take this evening departure 23h45, `destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra 'scheduled arrival at 6:30 am. 
Three buses are reserved primarily for the Italians in a bus traveling on brésilens exclusively. 
In a corner of the terminal, the South American singing of gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated the last night. 
And noisy, says Marco Guarda, not for the Italians. 
The bus belonged to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and bezels with wide silver mounts. 
For five years they go to the Oktoberfest, already three trips this year alone. 
They go at night, still day at the festival and back to 22.30. 
Y spend the night mean unnecessary costs, "says Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the pot with a welcome Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a leader in German - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt. 
And already the bus ride into the night on the Autostrada `Brennero direction. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Quickly, everything is calm on the bus, passengers sleep. 
It's better this way, they will still need their forces. 
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other bus with Italian registration plates are once again a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8. 
When the early morning, the group of Marco finally thirty six hours as scheduled on the parking place near the Teresa, nearly 50 more buses from all over Europe are already there. 
Elena, Luca and others congregate, Marco takes a final speech, explained the plan of attack. 
First: her hair to the small yellow cap. 
Top left is written `Oktoberfest ', in Gothic, and later the Internet address of the travel agency Marco` conoscersiviaggiando.it. " 
Second: `When the doors of the beer tent open, there ', Marco cries in the morning. 
`Run!" Run and reserved seats at the back of the tent. 
`No front, otherwise blocked, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, they must be spread in the room!" 
The mug, Marco Cree, costs 8.25 euros. 
And do not forget the record! 
`Show the security officers that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave your seats, they're off! " 
Third: `Tonight, back here a decade and a half hours battery!" Included? 
And that's it, let's go to Oktoberfest. 
On the way, someone is forging yellow caps trees to find the way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
It would be ready to return. 
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the `weekend Italians'. 
There are no precise figures, we are talking about 50 000 who are set route through the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would come to express Italy this weekend. 
Munich police is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tirol, through sauveteurs Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who makes a statistic on countries where the Italians took the top spot before the British (60 interventions) and Austria (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
One that is especially popular among Italian is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu. 
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is stable, insists the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word `respect 'and he slipped the German banking sector was not spared by the movement of crisis. 
It is indeed occurred this weekend. 
The real estate financial Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX later, obtains a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect themselves from market turbulence. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are granted up to an amount of 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the portion which would have entitled it. 
The money comes as many banks as private banks by public law. 
In the background is the daughter company that supports Depfa losses. 
The financial status was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term to long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is possible since because of the mistrust markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the cash reserve bank had been reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million, the rate of capital also had weakened slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The current profits and net from financial transactions were compared to the same period last year, fell to zero, profits from the allocation of loans and securities and determined that termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by over 70 per cent to 5 million. 
And only by the high profits from cost reimbursement accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, and the repayment of interests as the book of tax procedures and procurement for commercial companies Konzern that the deficit gains of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate. 
After its privatization in 1990, the former financial status had initially speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which were then spin to the bank Aareal. 
Because what the classical state funding was not profitable enough, then the Depfa had more intensely engaged in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects between private investors and State (Public-Private-Partnership , PPP) and diversified internationally. 
On the value of the company daughter, Hypo Real Estate needs to depreciation that should have on the calculation of gains and losses of a group essential equipment which is still quite vague. 
The fact is that dividends have been amputated. 
Already for 2007, they were truncated to two-thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate has been the acquisition of Depfa, an investor of state infrastructure and highly important. 
It is stronger than other institutes dependent on the refinancing of inter-bank market because it has no deposit customers. 
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has dried up significantly again, banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - the total appropriations of Depfa of a short-term refinancing. 
According to a communiqué of the Hypo Real Estate, borrowing the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely unable to walk now. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be provided with funds until the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the board of HRE Georg Funke said however that the group Hypo Real Estate should no longer having to resort to financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) on the premise that the ability of the group Hypo Real on the market is now assured. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank no longer than hoped. 
However, given the dynamic and the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not unthinkable that he should not rely on any funding in its scope. 
But the opposite can not be ruled out. 
After that the bank is, according to the latest releases, even at the gates of insolvency Sunday late evening, this rescue at least provisional will fail to reassure the minds either. 
The stock fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
Bond prices, however, are doing particularly well. 
While the primary debts have barely budged, courses loans fall back. 
The most affected are mainly investment funds of the former Hypo-Württemberg daughter and of course those who have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the tightening net of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself brought the crisis in the institution by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and commercial banks are less affected yet ready to support the system, we can presume a reduction of arrears in time. 
Or what will happen nobody dares hope right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But faced renewed sound of a partial nationalization, the probability approaching reliability is now just a hope founded. 
This book should sleepless nights to creditors before any long-term decision on whether they should get rid of their commitments. 
The short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line to form a report losses for the coming years on the next tax revenue from capital gains from stock automatically. 
Sylvana and secrets of the box Bento 
When Hiltrop Sylvana, 16, must appear for the first day of Highschool Tachibana, girls begin to giggle: the German is so "kawaii"! 
What does it mean? 
Sylvana already knows the word through the Angels - in his new Log exchanges, she speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of classes in Japan. 
What I was excited. 
Already the way to school I was scared. 
I live in the Tokyo suburb of Kawasaki direction and I take the train 40 minutes until Highschool of Tachibana. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I have not lost. 
The start of the course does not appear to be established so strict that home in Lower Saxony. 
The students appear one after the other from eight hours, until, at least twenty nine hours, a round table began with the teacher, the "home room". 
But before the course begins, it was for me to introduce myself. 
I am not at all like the type to talk to people, especially before a class of 40 students. 
As I had not yet uniform of the school, I have an old skirt of my host mother and a shirt, blue socks rising and black leather shoes. 
In this dress so I went to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ...' - I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that time, I was very pleased to have started learning the language there two years. 
The 31 girls in the class have made messes low giggle and make signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew through my manga. 
It is the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage." 
Then I quickly slipped in my place. 
The girl next to me gave me a big smile ironic, she found that it was an honor that the corresponding should sit next to her. 
The rest of the time was fairly calm, but when the gong resounded, I was attacked in the rules. 
Everyone who spoke better better, giggle and asked me many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, then they have all left their Bento. 
My foster mother also made me such Lunchbox - it's really anything but the case-miserable in Germany. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
Things have a weird look and taste completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Well, except perhaps salted preserved plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools. 
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a Bento she prepared herself, and it is prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my manga. 
I am curious to know if I could also see it here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I've told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo. 
I always answered: 
"Because it fascinates me, what" 
Ultimately, reading manga is what I prefer for years already. 
And to better understand the culture and manga inside, at a time, I also started to learn Japanese. 
For me it was really clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I have a soft spot for traditions, customs and us. 
And here they are given great importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technology and latest trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen. " 
Rats also have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach before fleeing the danger, is it-that means he also feels fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
But how can we verify that it is experiencing the same thing when it behaves the same way that we? 
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think can be true without having proof?" 
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has so far been able to prove just as one can not prove that human beings have a consciousness. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration. 
As soon as we look to other species and that we address the issues of perceived or general consciousness, we enter into difficult terrain feasible because the hardware does not match. 
When a rat is a danger before it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, leaking or attack. 
Human beings behave the same way, is why some scientists infer a subjective experience comparable. 
However, I do not think so. 
Two aspects of brain structure make the implementation of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult. 
One aspect is that the circuit almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and the functions of leadership and execution). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent from other beings. 
So the very least for these latter aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is different even other primates. 
Another significant feature may be the language of men: much of its existence being linked to language, this means that often depends on his conscience. 
In this case, it could exclude animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, it will surely influence, so that the animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, is probably much distinguishes most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is difficult to determine is what consciousness among other animals. 
If this internal and subjective, does not measure or because of this particular Hardware, analyze, based on our own experience, then its observation we poses major problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the contents of conscious experience, but there is next to another aspect of conscience who should be more readily available science. 
One could examine the process of consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on short-term memory primates, especially with the example of visualization. 
But this approach was followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses on the relationship nerve of consciousness as the causal mechanisms: the two may be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also stresses the weight of the prefrontal cortex in achieving visualization. 
But what result he then emotions? 
I conclude that emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own. 
What we designate as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, as the reactions of the body) accounts of RAM. 
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans. 
Subtle degrees of experience, combined with our voluble nature, emerge because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to charge for other than ourselves. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes that such feelings from primitive activities are born in areas of the body sensation of Cortex and brainstem, as Jaak Pankseep however, which focuses more on the brainstem. 
As the network has not significantly changed during human evolution, it could quite involved cross sensations of all kinds. 
From a purely theoretical, I can not contradict, but I think it indémontrable. 
Pankseep argues that what appears as the fear among men and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how could yet determine whether rats and men feel the same thing when they behave similarly? 
A cockroach fled to the danger, but if he feels fear? 
In my eyes, for similar behavior are not sufficient to prove the same experiences. 
While the comparison nervous aid: rats and men have similar brain stem, by cockroaches against do not have even a brain. 
But is it true that the brainstem is causing sensations? 
And even if we could prove it to humans: how can we demonstrate in rats? 
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cockroaches (who knows?) Have feelings. 
But I do not know how the show. 
And because their feelings will likely differ from ours completely (since human consciousness is based on special tracks and the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior that rats emotional sensations. 
In all cases, progress on the plan poignent nervous in that mark is the same in rats and humans. 
I will not like the language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We may consider it as short term, but I prefer to advance rather than me constantly banging against a wall. 
I am indeed an emotional pragmatic.

"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, together with Poland, the European Championships, announced Wasjunik. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.

In the timetable for construction or destruction stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, two hosts running late. 
The number of stages for the European Championship could be reduced from eight to six.

Dennis Quaid outraged against attack 
She wanted to make the promotion for a new movie, talked about his private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulterous Dennis Quaid. 
It scum - and against attack. 
A war of the late Rose for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engaged in a battle disgraceful - in full view of everyone. 
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed in an interview with the American magazine InStyle on the causes of the failure of marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
She became aware of the extent of the deception only after divorce. 
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in press relations Ryan for his new movie "The Women" - is recounted the story of adultery. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his qualification unfaithful husband fell clearly it would be "Monstrueux", it said the "New York Daily News", 54 years, "Meg Blind once again the history of our relationship and manipulated ". 
It would be more "regrettable" that "the pain and dislocation that include a divorce for every child should again be revived in public" common for their son 16 years Jack. " 
As Ryan lived alone since the divorce, remarried and Quaid will soon become the father of twins. 
Thus was his response to scratch: "In any case, my life continues. 
I consider myself happy to have a wonderful family that goes better. " 
The prices of airline tickets and hotel fall 
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less expensive than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a study present the same flights would be reduced to 50 percent. 
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial again - this is the result of a study of financial services and travel American Express. 
The company analyzed its data from bookings in the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp drop in profits in the second quarter. 
After the market prices of hotels have increased over the years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places. 
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined. 
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year. 
The trend was especially clear to Paris and Rome, where travelers were paid 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier. 
The reasons for this lie for American Express in the low rate of the dollar which led to a "desire to travel down of American tourists." 
The financial centers like Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by lower prices of hotels that industrial sites as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish town, hotel prices are held with a rise of 26.3 per cent record in Europe. 
Also on price flights, the trend was the increase in the first quarter: 
Because of the rising price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, most consumers of fuel, have risen up 29.2 per cent. 
From April to June, prices for economy class tickets have fallen an average of 12.5 percent compared with the previous quarter, business class and first class, however, price changes were far less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have fallen even more important than in other European countries: 
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent. 
German domestic flights have been halved by this study. 
The reasons for the price drop would be on one side economic growth down, says the firm. 
The request cede ground in many segments of the market for air travel. 
On the other hand, there is a heightened pressure of competition by the treaty "open skies" liberalizing air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of unprofitable routes and the number of airlines that have filed stock during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone. 
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0 
With one goal and methods simply, SV Hamburg becomes the first ranking. 
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven. 
Kristoffer of Klein. Larger. Crash landing for international player Marko Marin. 
Gladbach player not returned late in the game and lifted his shot against the failed part of the goal. 
His message was precisely formulated, he was released from his lips so persuasive. 
He just knew he was right. 
"We need that second goal," Hermann Rieger whistles in the locker room corridor of the arena of Hamburg. 
It does not go much in the locker room, the half-time was over and most were stale in their place. 
Rieger has been for nearly three decades of the physiotherapist HSV, it enjoys a great reputation like many former players. 
And that is why his application was received at strategic places. 
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and lifted his thumb to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of head coach Martin Jol Hamburg. 
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and it jumps with the second goal! 
The practice has failed. 
"Everything was not very nice to see today," confessed later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would "also wanted to be more relaxed." 
This 1:0 (1:0 at half time), the team of the Hamburg must strike the head successful by Mladen Petric (at 11th minute) and the fact that the very weak players Gladbach could not hurt the weak players from Hamburg. 
"It was a dirty victory", summed Marin Jol. 
SV Hamburg on Monday to celebrate its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and tables for provisional classification on the giant screen which showed their club as the first of the class. 
It's going to be without a birthday celebration. 
"We know step back," said Marcell Jansen. 
There is little doubt that the interim result of the table reflects the unpredictability of the first League that the dominance of its HSV. 
The team arrived late with its commitment - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Jansen Petric as profligate FC Bayern - will certainly form slowly, but it still does not shine. 
"We need more charming and more than dribbles," Jol required.

Of dark matter influence the flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in perplexity: the dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during the so-called gravitational maneuvers support. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" fly in space. 
Because of fuel conduits soon jellies, cryogenic death threats. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused dismay among researchers - the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
The support is a gravitational maneuver space probes, for which they receive a further boost in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example. 
Thus, the sensors can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe search America-European Cassini-Huygens used this trick physical, like Ulysses solar probe. 
That surprised researchers elsewhere for years: the flying objects are not always 100 percent the way it looks as venerable laws of gravity. 
Moreover, irregularities appear at speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect. 
They named the anomaly gravitational support. 
Some experts feared that the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter because of the curvature of space can not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron qu'Einstein not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational support by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, a matter which is also close to the Earth," he wrote. 
Researchers at the space know the existence of dark matter only for about ten years. 
It apparently comes her an attractive force that is observable effect on other celestial bodies. 
She, for against, is completely invisible, ie it does or does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light. 
According to scientific calculations, the dark matter still represent a fifth of the entire mass of the universe. 
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free

The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be en route to Cairo. 
The circumstances around the shooting before the release of hostages still vague: for example, the kidnappers were reportedly close to end the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army did killing six of the kidnappers without warning. 
"The problem was resolved. 
They were in agreement with a ransom, "said the official. 
All that remained was to collect the hostages, "when suddenly," the surprise "occurred. 
Sudanese soldiers were killed on Sunday six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and had arrested two of them. 
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom Germany in the amount of six million; money should be returned by the wife of a German hostage. 
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was falling behind because the kidnappers feared for their safety.

Abuse of a stepfather "that led to suicide" 
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by her stepfather led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, from Stithians in Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indictment for indecent assault. 
The High Court in Truro has referred regularly to bind his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death." 
The court was informed that Miss Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, had committed Trerise and bandaged before the force in sexual acts, while his mother worked at the pub. 
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80s, he returned to live in Cornwall. 
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth. 
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, diligent volunteer National Trust, was haunted abuse that had occurred twice a week. 
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife said that the court had told friends that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope for life."

He added: "I note in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crimes committed during the years on Stephanie. 
"Without them, it would probably become a happy young woman, promising, and success."

Building societies face the invoice B &amp; B. 
The British building societies may have to pay a bill of more than £ 80 million to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford &amp; Bingley. 
The Government has provided £ 14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million depositors of Bradford &amp; Bingley. 
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect money from investors, including 59 companies of the building. 
The director general of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" to know that societies and their members must pay the mess ... 
The loan of £ 14 billion will be repaid when the mortgage from Bradford &amp; Bingley will be available. 
But the interests that will simultaneously increase, will be charged each year with 700 companies reap the financial deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions had a safe ... must now pay some bills institutions that were far less conservative. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It proclaims that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that companies must pay intermediaries about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan amount in 2009 to £ 450millions. 
This means that companies must find £ 81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial building societies, told the BBC that the decision seemed unjust. 
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions had a safe at the resumption of the real estate market, must now pay for institutions much less conservative. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, when the first record. 
"We must consider all aspects of the case during the coming weeks to evaluate options to be adopted to ensure that building societies and their members pay the invoice salt," said Cole. 
Interest cover for 2009 seven months ending September this year until late March. 
In 2010, it will pay interest of the entire year, which could also double. 
Because the companies are building organizations without shareholder, family member end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates for savings accounts.

His lawyers said the court refused to grant bail because of his indictment for having extorted a businessman, 50 million Taka ($ 729000.00) when she was PM. 
This case is one of many charges on it. 
Khaleda Zia, the still rival Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed on bail earlier this month. 
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh next few weeks, but his party, the League Awan, demanded that the provisional military government of the country provides them their complete freedom. 
Correspondents noted that the terms of his release is conflicting because if he allows to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could not remain free on his return to Bangladesh. 
His lawyers have now announced that it will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina saying she does not bond as it had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.

BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which obliges it to reduce its stake in its rival ITV transmitter. 
The Court of Appeal Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to 7.5%. 
The commission said that in the past, the participation of MSkyB prevented competition and allowed him to influence unfairly ITV. 
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed in fact to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, ITV buys. 
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares has cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, prompting consequently, the Competition Commission to investigate

BSkyB has argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and contrary was excessive - especially given that BSkyB has to renounce its voting rights. 
New investigation in case of U.S. prosecutors. 
The U.S. attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006. 
Everything is born of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
The survey is based on the argument of lawyers who claim that their dismissal was due to political causes. 
The special prosecutor, Nora Dannehy now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to investigators and obstructing justice. 
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine's report. 
The appointment of a special prosecutor can compel witnesses to testify, was one of its main recommendations. 
The argument starts with the removal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice. 
At the time, the department said that prosecutors were fired because of poor performance. 
But it then emerged that prosecutors were not dismissed criticism that their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to label the dismissals a political connotation. 
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate about accusations of vote fraud against Democrats. 
U.S. prosecutors investigating and prosecuting courts for the government. 
It is certain they can be dismissed at any time, but l can not be for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, eventually accused of being involved in the case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned. 
A number of officers of the Department of Justice have also given their resignation. 
The report of the Inspector General was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating he saw "primary responsibility" for the terminations, and ends with "abdicate" its leadership role, "remarkably successful in not involved in this case. 
Other officers, including former associate of Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.

A Dark Street in the City, often forgotten, and May Soon Be for Sale. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional. 
. And even some taxis veterans and local residents long do provide guidance to go to Extra Place, as they have never heard of. 
The street is in the East Village and travels north of First Street-not to be confused with-Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue. 
From about 30 feet wide by 120 long, it looks like a dusty lane artery rather than active. 
. No signs indicate the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard atlas. 
This street, however admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street. 
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother transition shops and boutiques, which should open in new buildings. 
Other admirers including neighbors long said they were charmed by this shortened simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block. 
But the Department of Conservation and Development Property of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping. 
This month, at a meeting of committees of neighborhood owners, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal authorizing the construction management to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, manager of the local No. 3. 
"There is little space in the city, and we hope that the city retains Extra Place" she said. 
"They could offer to rehabilitate and manage, what could also Avalon, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repave the small street and install seats, some are also used by a cafe which the manufacturer concede space. 
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean she wants to be the owner. 
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is Relooker of this abandoned alley and make it public," she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest selling. " 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing also that the Agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage. 
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight imprint history. 
Some believe this door and non Place name since 1802, when the legacy of the great many farm children Philip Minthorn was divided, leaving aside the small piece of land, which remained abandoned since. 
The subsequent entry of CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, has re opened Extra Place, the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia" 
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scrap, in rags, barrels, posters, sheet and ropes. " 
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about moving towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Others proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity-a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be damn in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Challenges: A View bitterly Nostalgique on a city in the process of extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a small cul-de-sac narrow, dark day and night, and bounded through the doors of a warehouse and rusty iron shutters, full of newspapers in the week that fly along the gutters. " 
With few exceptions, the street has the same speed. 
A nimbly court rat at the bottom of the alley near a door that once led to CBGB, which is now the seat of a chic clothing store. 
Graffiti on walls, a bottle of beer 22 ounces empty, is next to newspapers, which have just been discarded. 
Some passersby said they believe that rarely Extra Place, and suggested its development. 
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimate the lure of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "were held in dark places, humid and disgusting." 
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English 
In this part of the Supervision of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates about bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "not as good as you think. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school. " 
Attract Hispanic voters favor is a complicated business. 
Proposals for Barack Obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr. Obama stresses that "students Afro-American and Latino are less likely to graduate than white students." it is a fact true. 
To combat these differences, the education program supports Mr. Obama particularly among many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are learning English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that promotes education class in languages other than English, will further its interest to eliminate the differences. 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County. 
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low income. 
More than a third of students, consisting of many newcomers, studying English. 
Among students CM1, 100% have passed the state exam math in 2008, expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the examination for English-language-d'arts 
This incredible success was achieved by another ingredient that made by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street focuses on analysis, practice, evaluation of the capabilities and exemplary. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Mikels Linda, main Sixth Street, the school has established the direction of the English language "full immersion". 
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, has affirmed "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you go without its class, you had no chance to identify it. " 
"This works, she observes," it worked for us " 
Mr. Obama should not follow the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves, but policies on education within his party (the Association for Education have long argued bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of the response of Mr. Obama. 
Although favor of immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing over the wording of laws in English. 
"On the contrary, he said," you must ensure that your child speaks Spanish. " 
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then it should consider carefully the education models that work, rather than to scorn or to consider them as insignificant. 
Net Petroleum response to new concerns of the World Economy 
Oil prices fell sharply Monday because people fear that the rescue plan for the capital markets, successfully revive the economy. 
Forward transactions of crude oil, fell by 7 percent reaching $ 99.80 a barrel. The Mercantile Exchange in New York, at sales this morning.

"The prospective global equity, interest rate and exchange markets, has become uncertain," wrote analysts from Deutsche Bank in a letter to their investors. " 
"We believe that raw materials can not escape this contagion. 
"Regarding raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus spread it globally and especially in China."

Second Day deterministic time for the Improvement of the Record of the team. 
After spending during the past eight seasons, longer than anyone in uniform Jets Shaun Ellis, the defense thought it had seen everything. 
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I've never seen anything of this kind," said Ellis. 
The second phase began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals have dirtily played under dark clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre was able to make a pass to Laveranues Coles for a touchdown from 12 yards, precursor of an afternoon during which their relationship has leaped forward. 
Favre found Coles for another two Touchdowns, the first when a corner fell back and the second, 10 seconds of the half-time. 
"I'm not out of my zone" Favre said of all his passes to Coles. 
"This is a mediocre player" 
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think." 
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat back the quarter of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrell Revis, corner back, intercepted a shot and had lost 32 yards to touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another pass and was intercepted. 
Linebacker David Bowens gave the ball away because of Warner. 
At the last change, loss of ball Bowens, could well be the most charming 
The Cardinals took control of possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal from 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best the Jets were able to mark a time. 
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said" the second or third time? " 
When he was told both the Jets have lost 21 points in the third incontestable time Mangini said: "I can tell you that I most enjoyed the second time as the third. 
. "Many points were scored in a short time." 
Gebrselassie rested than his world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has again proved worthy of his title of best rider background of the century, having beaten his own world record at Berlin Marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie has broken 27 seconds a record of 2: 04: 26, competed last year in Berlin. 
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, 1600mètres marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fear can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today - that air pollution increases asthma problems. 
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect conditions-sunny, 48 degrees at the start, 55-upon arrival Gebrselassie won Sunday, maintaining impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
Track riders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted to riders of substance, have contributed to the decrease in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05. 
After the victory Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters, he suffered cramps in the calf two weeks before, and have missed training for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest helped him remained brilliant, but not rusty. 
"I am so happy," he told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I was handed last week and today I had doubts, but at the end, everything went for the better. " 
He was criticized, notably in Kenya, the east African rival of Ethiopia to have too-orchestrated shopping, avoiding the marathon world stars, in fact counting on hares as if they were in a race track And considering more world records that the sense of competition. 
But that criticism does not diminish the greatness Gebrselassie capabilities as a rider of substance. 
Gebrselassie Sunday, preceded by four Kenyans, had a time of 1: 02: 04. halfway. 
Two elite Kenyan runners, James and Charles Kamathi kwamba, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the file headers are missing. 
At a little over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final lift to move from kwamba, which ends second in 2: 05: 36, improving his personal best of five minutes. 
Kamath is coming third in 2:07:48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19. 
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25. 
Last spring, Mikitenko aged 36 years, has surprised everyone, winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14. 
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical backache, but promised to win in Berlin, improving his third marathon, his personal record by almost five minutes. 
She ran that use a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a good advantage, the excess then after about 18miles ½. 
Askale TAFA Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Hélène Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01. 
In a city from the Pride and the trials of Black Life 
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sun, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a small town where born pride and complications of African-American experience. 
"Eatonville, the first city to fully integrate black, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description it did in 1935, is no longer so easy to do nowadays." The city in the five lakes, three croquet courts,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and not in prison. " 
It has now become a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival held annually in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in many ways, the city she describes has become tourism thanks to its inclusion in the tour guide to Florida published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project-remains a place apart. 
It is also independent, dignified and private than it was in the 30s, when Hurston told that the black rural population in Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man, that "we know so little, does not know what it loses. " 
Even if it is the year of electing a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue about race, many here remain cautious eye of abroad. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, has always been resident and the oldest parishioners of the city. 
"it must conform to reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It is both a historical model of an empowerment of black and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a focal point but also an example of Southern black rural culture-sometimes scorned, other times acclaimed, which recalls the birth of American slavery. 
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston. 
She presented her hometown to the world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the Guide to Florida transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road running through the center of Florida, often forgotten, which results in terms of black history and human drama. 
Bold like a bass drum in life as in literature, Hurston led drives to store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"Past the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and playgrounds well preserved that Howard Miller has always been careful, though he knew just read and write. 
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and Glenn Lee wrote that "sells drinks of any kind and anything that can serve travelers. 
So in just a hundred words, Hurston Eatonville associations to self government but also to illiteracy, to remarriage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not. 
It was not actually a portrait that everyone appreciated. 
Zora has described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls was immortalized qu'Hurston Johnson, citing the songs without color, interpreted by men who rented their beauty." 
She said: "Some people did not like." 
It still remembers Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, which was frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston arrived in town usually without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many made fun of her. 
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said. 
But he adds, swaying in his chair after the patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly known that "it was never too long." 
After the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and his books were out of production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman from Barnard College for 20 years, she was buried in a tomb whatsoever, in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived. 
A Eatonville, no major commemoration plaque or the general public. 
I do not think they understood the contribution or the legacy it offered the world, "said Valerie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Public Officials of Orange County wanted to pass a highway to five lanes in the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, main street to two lanes of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed up the Interstate 4 west corner of the city. 
The proposal was made to alors qu'Eatonville just recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, among other things, ended the isolation of the relatively idyllic community. 
In the 50s, the dispute over racial mixing led to hatred doors of the community. 
"at that time, a band of young whites came oranges or throw objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin. 
"A woman is even dead." 
They launched a watermelon in their car. " 
In a 1955 letter sent to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court aimed at forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "rather than glorify insulting my race." 
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although some positive aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the confidence of youth. 
"Black children were used to be embraced me I remember we kissed our master in the morning and evening," said NY Nathiri, daughter Ella Dinkins and Executive Director of Saving the Commonwealth of Eatonville, a non profit group. 
That lasted, she added, until teachers and students came more from the same place. 
"You n'embrasses not your white teacher because he is white I want to say here that there is a cultural dividing line," said Miss Nathiri. 
Civil rights, moreover, have helped create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who went further injury, as, armed with a joyful trust and guidelines, such as: "How can they have the pleasure of my company!" 
This is beyond me. " 
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the tomb of anonymous Hurston and began to struggle to revive its reputation. 
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston conducted by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, thus reintroducing the American cannons. 
The proposed highway came just as the girl most famous Eatonville had regained its appeal. 
And this time, old neighbors Hurston consider it a sauveuse. 
The community began to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that having this highway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January for the commemoration. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal for the highway. 
"The fiasco of the highway to five lanes, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Miss. Nathiri. 
Ms Boyd summed it all declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the project of the highway has enabled it to change its own image. 
Persons not resident, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attends our church depuis1993 began coming in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A single theme library (renamed obviously Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repave. 
Today, Eatonville is an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, she may at any time see themselves as a street back later at a rainy summer day, small as it was when It was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s. 
(There are now 90 percent black) 
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'etre, is still treated with caution. 
We must ask permission for most interviews, and some things like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, showing black men in the fields should not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a courageous teacher and has a weakness for bright red, have always worried that their island community is not well understood. 
However, given the expansion of Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: nice, problems and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America. 
It is the sincere affection civic we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or forces Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for the youngest, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the correct description Eatonville. 
"Most people who come into this area there will think:" oh, this city is nothing compared to other "Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take time to contemplate the story is a beautiful city. " 
Here in New York, all fluent in finance. 
Still, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan were held away from the booth and giant TV screens in Times Square, they do not realize they are in the eye of the hurricane. 
They never could believe that in offices and glass honeycomb over their heads, bankers and managers of hedge funds that dominate New York, spend the worse day of work at the office "from the crack 1929. 
The deliverymen continue to slip on the streets with their carts and trays of muffins for meetings matinières. 
Latin drag still in the residential buildings bearing as mules, fifty Shirt luxurious hanged in a yoke on his shoulders ready. 
Office workers continue to queue up to buy the Sandwich Matinier hawkers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h during the week. 
I did not feel the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account. 
Fortunately, I had planned to work late afternoon, as I discovered to my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a score of people queuing. 
Not at the counters of cashiers, or to withdraw from the case or make a payment, but the front window of customer service, where customers order their checkbooks, tourists asked management to the shop Macy, and new customers open accounts. 
Most of those to me, I would later Starr, my "banker authorized personnel" were all the tail for the same reason as me. 
Not in the same way as they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called Thrift (such as a building society), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that work in only one state, and who say the deal customers as their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt. 
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with capital of $ 327 was made to the trustee in bankruptcy, and while New Yorkers were returning to the house for the weekend Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the accounts of a value of $ 440 million, a buyer was desperate to save her. 
The officers and employees of stores that are before me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable, or that which is most rescue Wall Street. 
Of any New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity they might have to criticize a colleague. 
And Lyn, the concierge uniform in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries of my merchant of fruits and vegetables. 
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in money market funds. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take risk." 
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria swings to the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the party's right wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday January 17 2008. 
They carry signs showing mosques striped red. 
Police accused the right-wing extremists have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austria, the weekend victory of political parties of the extreme right in general elections in the country. 
More than 90 tombs have been seriously damaged at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning it is according to the police, an organized action. 
The offenders were painted on several graves, symbols such as the Jewish Star of David; detectives believe that this could be done to disguise the feeling of hatred towards extremist Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could be somehow linked to elections. 
A spokesperson for the local Islamic Community said he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious months of Ramadan which is nearing its end. 
The Austria feels strongly to recover his courage, following its swing to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two extreme right parties have won almost 30 percent of votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign against immigration. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party which won more than 18 percent of votes, led a campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food alah. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe. 
The surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, defined the extreme right as the bloc's strongest country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference as worried about their future in 'European Union. 
Gary Glitter to travel abroad. 
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain. 
The magistrates have imposed a ban Glitter six months after he had expressed to the authorities who controlled his intention to travel to Spain via France. 
Kent Police had given the travel ban last Thursday after the magistrates proved the guilt of Glitter for child sexual abuse.

If it does not communicate its movements to the authorities, it could serve a sentence up to five years' imprisonment. 
Kent Police said it does not discuss individual cases or the potential displacement of Glitter in the contée. 
A spokesman for Kent Police said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as those from abroad. 
"We believe it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effective. 
"protect the people of Kent is the most expensive intention to Kent Police, and we monitor closely the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region to minimize potential risks to the public." 
. Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, respectively, 10 and 11 years. 
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok where he would board a flight to London. 
But he said not feeling well and refused to leave for London. 
Thai authorities blocked at the passport control, and in the end, he left for Hong Kong. 
The Chinese authorities have refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore obliged to leave in Bangkok, the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he would return to England. 
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to court limited jurisdiction of Uxbridge, West London, for registered in the list persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard. 
In the past, Glitter was already serving a sentence of four months in the UK, for possession of images of child abuse. 
A source from the Ministry of Interior said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister was pleased and reassured to know that Glitter had been forbidden to travel in France and Spain. 
"I photograph the contracting out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer 
Neither heels or clothing releases. 
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free of all tensions for the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman. 
On the one hand the artist. 
On the other hand, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy in these moments unknown to the general public, on discovers where to intimate gestures and glances stolen artists who do not care about on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer blend in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists this side with lesser-known artists. 
In this project, the photographer takes the iconography of flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the programming of the Month of Photography Flemish, the exhibition reflects the international importance of flamenco, the greater each day, "says creator, clarifying that" Flamenco - people "can be anyone, but after seeing the pictures, the observer realizes that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage. 
These people photographed in the street "artists are able to transmit live the passion, sadness, joy ... in captivating the public. 
To capture moments of personality of these artists should not be making pictures on stage. 
They have a personality and character. 
What interested me was to create an atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera moments personality of the stars of flamenco. " 
With the festival Song People Mines, "Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists and dancers with a camera plate. 
These are portraits that, by choosing the camera and equipment, recalls the classic photograph. 
The implementation of various stylistic breaks with the classical side of the image, giving a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A roots music with very traditional and evolving every day surprises ". 
This is not dancing or singing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art. 
The search for the essence and magic was constant work that we present these days it to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from approximately seventy artists photographed. 
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for portraits Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of old sports" ( "SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits he loves photographing portraits of people, know and be able to enter their lives for a moment longer or shorter. 
I believe that in the portrait photography is the genre most difficult. 
You are in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or leave you just a few minutes to make them a picture. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try my ideas become reality. " 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is exposed to the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 Rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Poplar Hercules) to be opened until 16 October.

The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way to measure whether and books change people's lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar" because it was requested writers "not to let the frivolity" and assume their vocation.

"Sangre de Mayo", dared to challenge the Garci 
Based on the stories of Galdós Benito Perez, Jose Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million budget . 
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate social analysis" it has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Echevarría and Paula Gutierrez to head the long list of players. 
The film will last more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will release in theaters next Friday, which later became a television series for Telemadrid more than four hours. 
Great admirer of literature Galdós, Jose Luis Garci assured of having made this film with a "childhood dream" by Esperanza Aguirre, who was charged three years ago, a film commemorating for both hundred years of Madrid on May 2, something he has always accepted it when the story was the national historical facts. 
The 15 million euros provided by the Comunidad de Madrid Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with decorations and clothing appropriate atmosphere "a Spain that was the wrong leader for combat, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellion during the reign of Ferdinand VII, "he reported. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained financing for movies like "Captain Alatriste" and "Goya's Ghosts" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he was unable to run some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he worked for almost his entire career. 
The director of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way to work on the staging of the actors with whom he used to repeat before starting the shooting and that there is no casting, since it seemed to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and film to keep informed." 
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeated in front of the camera, as Rellán Miguel, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo. 
Four times a candidate for an Oscar (he won one), Garcia believes that the three films candidates who represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French billiard tables and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers" are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which should be better known," he said. 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
"At first you think you work for posterity, and then you realize that you work for prosperity, and now you are happy to make a film and more," said Garcia after more than 30 years of career. 
Isabelle Bayón begins in the skin of the dancer Tórtola Seville Valencia 
A dancer Seville will honor a dancer also Seville. 
Tórtola Carmen Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and at the age of three will live in London with his family . 
It was a dancer and dance free dance specialist. 
She had a fascinating life, a pioneer of women's liberation, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the brace that prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to interpret the dancer Valencia and Seville Tórtola it seemed incredible." 
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his thinking. 
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco. 
Thus, the "Butterfly Dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and dance of the snake "in some tangos. 
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers, "she says. 
The staging was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again in Isabela one of its shows, as he had to "La puerta abierta" and the professor Matilde Coral, which exceptionally well to cooperate with one that was his pupil. 
"Matilde Tórtola transforms into a mature character. 
I am happy because it has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me. " 
The staging was also through music composition and guitar de Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, y el Pulga Moi de Morón; percussion El Pájaro, and the Rafa El viola Viola and the collaboration of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were regarded as divas." 
This work also recounts, in a way, the life of this woman who was displayed in places so distant, especially for the time, as in India, the United States or Russia, but also throughout Europe, it was habitually resident in London. 
"I wanted to remember because I think it is these women who have an enormous influence in their time and now nobody knows and does value his work," says Bayon. 
The show will begin at 20:30 in theater Lope de Vega 
The publication of "Diary of a poet recently married," concludes the triennium 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a Poet recently married" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez Zenobia married in March 1916, is part of the activities provided by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the granting of the Nobel Prize for Literature and death. 
In this way, "triennium Zenobia and Juan Ramon" is coming to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress held in New York with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jimenez: This poplar light "which was inaugurated last May and who, after traveling in different provinces of Andalusia, will go to New York at the International Congress.

The less like America without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect person 
Paul Newman was one. " 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice" and illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and throughout America, given the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world. 
He had difficulty obtaining an Oscar 
It does more running since 2007. 
Everyone knew he was sick. 
It was a blow for everybody. 
"Sometimes what one feels beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence." 
Nobody afraid to make ridiculous or exaggerated. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the home died during a particularly dark, where terrorists and stock markets are fear, believes Americans fell well below, desperately seeking reasons of dignity. 
When times are so hard to live without reason, it is left to human beings and the admiration that there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
He embodied for everybody an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for combat drug created in honor of his eldest died following an overdose and creating its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has been difficult to prevail against a food culture suicidal. 
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attention or nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that James Bond died before him. 
Another English, the Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, Newman dared to appoint as his greatest inspiration. 
"We set the bar high," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only now trying to pierce the veil as did Paul Newman: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and away goals. 
It is not always easy or possible in the media jungle today. 
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, it was fifty years married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even though he lacked opportunities do not not be. 
"But why should I eat a burger away from me, if I have a steak in my fridge?", He used to joke. 
In heaven, it assists with pride to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
"Of all the major roles he has interpreted, it has never been as proud as the devoted husband, father love, caring grandfather and philanthropist," he said. 
Madrid in the race to host the Olympic Games of 2016 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved in 2016. 
But I wonder whether we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I have ever participated. 
If they had taken into account all errors that occurred during the race, they would be a failing grade. 
But considering everything in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes begin with race number, which t'oblige to go ahead. 
This is not bad but if you do move it would be best they give you everything (including the microchip for races). 
Well not 
They made you go there only to take the bib (the first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise, there were only the size 'S' for the jersey ( the second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
What kind of world we live? 
Is it there because of the crisis they have decided to buy shirts that small with less fabric and thus cheaper? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day. 
Apart from the need to go very soon to remove the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, furthermore, let his backpack at the entrance. 
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races. 
Because there was a long queue, the competitions have started and we did not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once, the withdrawal was worse. 
In addition, rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellions and attacks of barrack. 
I believe that 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, not even in the classification with the exact time, because the chip they gave me, which I think has not properly marked departure. 
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect example of course, it does not come especially to the idea. 
So I think we can always dream to become the host city for the Olympics in 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a receptionist (virtual) 
A conference on emerging technologies MIT Microsoft has been introduced a new system of image and recognition of human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle bus to get around the campus of the company) in response to what he was asked during a conversation. 
With a camera and a recognition system of forms and faces, this "receptionist can see exactly how many people there are in place, which they are - including remember what positions they hold - and listen and hear the words keys to their conversations. 
But also classified according to groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands it is not for the group is talking with her and she is not part of the company. 
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she said she will respond shortly. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which to concentrate, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week we talked in more than a change in strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and more will all programs. 
Steve Ballmer has found that when computers were sold with the necessary applications to be unnecessary, they would go five times faster. 
This represents a breakthrough as Microsoft, version after version, has steadily added features and extras to Windows. 
The policy change is welcome. 
Microsoft had reason operational system loses its importance but also its software. 
Chrome When Google arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step from Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for the hardware and software will understand. 
It occupies the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your stepmother. 
That's true. 
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operating system rather than an absolute truth but a truth as relative. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to operational system but more and more Internet browser. 
It turns on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than browsing windows. 
A serving half of the applications that come with the system? 
Who can do more can do less. 
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Less heavy, congested months, less complex. 
For now, Microsoft is more to launch its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need this, yes I show you an example. 
The photo in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the lounges reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond. 
On the drinks, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our Future". 
In 2006 a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search for information on the Internet. 
Last week delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not come out in early 2009 but late 2009 or see in 2010. 
Microsoft essaiera sûrement de lancer au même moment Windows 7 et Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after all, looks increasingly to a computer. 
But the launch was delayed Android and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear. 
Marcel Le Fabuleux 
Pablo Picasso endorsement on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in wearing one in the 'Blood Diamond' to Edward Zwick, along with Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of gay muscled.

But it also produces sweat-shirt, boxers retro, cashmere cardigans, trousers in cotton, babies, mini-shorts ... 
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear. 
Even if it is a pity to wear only underwear. 
They have too much charm.

Ever since I was very small I liked the clothes I wanted to go to my grandmother to look in the closets of my aunt and to see his clothes. 
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park. 
Then, when I became a dancer, always trying to take care of my way of dressing. 
The dancers love that dress for courses and testing to look in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the role as an actress, when you take the clothes it is at this moment that you truly put into the skin of the character.

Moreover, the good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to march for a noble cause, but if they ask me to pear, I would have done anyway. 
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World. 
Repeat offenders of drunken driving must install the system 'alcolock' 
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who took more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, had to be installed in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or not blowing. 
The initiative was announced last June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project which will last one year. 
Its aim is rehabilitation of the driver by offering courses in road rehabilitation. 
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety Foundation and the Institute for Security Technology of the car involved in this initiative. 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once drunk, took the car. 
The alcolock avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle which measures the rate of alcohol and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before or when the alcohol content of the driver is higher than allowed. 
Its cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is charged to the driver. 
In this regard, a study in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65% of offenses during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This measure ourselves as administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses. 
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be made by ordinary but, however, the reform made by criminal channels requires a reform of the organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some vehicles and function already has a trial basis. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install in school buses this system as was done in France.

- Ah, well, suddenly could not go to the airport to take customers at that time it ... Are you here or ...? 
- No, no sir, I am Spanish but I think lived here two years.

But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip. 
They are more waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a row of 27 military soldiers navy.

Speak sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I do not concern those who wake up very awakened by telling us something that happened the day before, but children who speak in their sleep. 
The first time it may surprise you but in reality it does not matter. 
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquie. 
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents. 
Certainly there is more than one who speaks during the night. 
This may appear very sporadically (once in life associated with such an episode of high fever) or more periodic (daily, weekly, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing. 
There is no single cause that determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other alterations sleep as nightmares, the night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (pee in bed) or sleepwalking, but it is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they may also be associated with very high fevers, to situations of stress or over-. 
Anyway it is a little-studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable. 
He may speak with a small quiet voice, with single words, the whispers or on the contrary, cries, tears, long speech ... 
Where the somniloquie becomes widespread, it would be wise to observe the child and to consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes great anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem. 
We said that it is a mild alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if linked to Sleep apnea or stress). 
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as: 
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore search of games quiet and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help calm inside. 
This will enable the child to have a more peaceful sleep. 
Once the somniloquies appear try to stay calm. 
Remember that they do not harm the child and the next day he did not remember what happened. 
Helpful Hints 
Do not wake up. 
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you wake up. 
Even if he speaks, he sits and sleeps so. 
Remember that it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in children. 
If you understand what he said (not usual), do not be tempted to ask for information. 
You get nothing, because sleeping, it is not aware to organize his thoughts. 
In addition, you hear what he says, but you will not know what it is now dreaming of the coup to be careful how you interpret that information and conclusions you draw from. 
Never say to the child you can witness during the night to hear its secrets. 
Not even jokingly. 
This causes much anxiety. 
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing much evil is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern ... finally 
Illhaeusern finally found the path to victory on his land after a long period of scarcity. 
Without making a great game, the Yellow and Black have created the largest number of occasions and have succeeded in turning a profit for the match. 
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty speaking. 
After a first attempt by the visitors captain Kaufmann who neared the skylight on a shot by far Illhaeusern would take slightly upward in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain end of the foot or Diebold came tickle Defense Dannemarie. 
In front, there was block midfield and allowed just stirring Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The beginning of second half would be decisive with the first two occasions and signed Riahi Temporale for Dannemarie, immediately after opening the score for Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to resume a postponed ball on a first attempt at Diebold (53rd). 
But the striker Illhousiens will not enjoy happiness long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not know the enjoyment and not cause any major problems at a Eleven illhousien who just fell a little for "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of game where, after a big mess, the ball going very near the cross. 
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen 
Before departing for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour via Brittany. 
Facing the show of force fishermen who have disrupted access Monday to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, the president decided to go Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistere, to meet their representatives. 
They have promised to host "in a constructive spirit" and hoped it "will come with concrete proposals". 
A presidential visit falls at the same time quune general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany for measures to address the soaring price of oil, which peaked at more than 1.14 euro per liter on average. 
According to the spokesman lElysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss them with solutions that can be devised to help their businesses to recover competitiveness and secure conditions of employment and remuneration sea". 
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to firm up by fishermen. 
Tuesday morning, they conducted operations in the Morbihan snails and Calvados, causing jams almost 10 km. 
The harbor of Quiberon was also blocked, but the routes to Belle-Isle not stopped. 
A dam filter has been under way on the Quiberon peninsula. 
The sailors have already shown their determination Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets before the fuel depot port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked or in Le Havre, where a score of boats blocked movements of merchant ships. 
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of major Total Donges refinery. 
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to await the meeting of the ministry Wednesday to decide on possible actions. 
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in lentrevue provided to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen do not abandon" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient. 
The fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but believe that the threshold of profitability of a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel less than 0.30 euro per liter .

Obama, who won the duel points in the first televised 
In the first debate Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won. 
Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters of Republican and Democrat declared their own victory in the televised duel was followed by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the benefit of John McCain, well than healthy, was not enough "brilliant" to enable it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks of presidential elections. 
The Gallup, including an opinion survey published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judge that the Democrat has pulled its own Thursday 
Among undecided voters, who are those who count, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama should be able to confirm his lead Thursday with the expected good performance of its colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is has good instincts, however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The seventies McCain has repeatedly put forward its unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." He accused several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured. 
Angle hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements. 
Obama has, he stressed that he represented the future. 
Without disassemble, it was concise and precise. 
He put forward its ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while qu'Obama if", argued this weekend, a spot criticizing the Democratic Republican did not take any measure the impact of the crisis on " American street ". 
"During the ninety-ten minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in a pouring rain . 
He did not even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers". "The rout clear financial advantage Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of the precipice. 
"The coming week could be a turning point", estimated yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama than Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain. " 
Reaffirming that would still reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that the achievement of any country's energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health insurance. 
McCain, he wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear plants by 2030. 
Cautious, both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, "you've noticed that there was an election you?" 
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation. 
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections. 
While no results have yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko "the dictator resignation." 
Some have not even admit voted: "What good, they will do what they want me," said a youth. 
They do not believe that the regime that has good foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to make a turning Democratic. 
The sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets could be lifted if the elections were seen as fit for the observers. 
They were not as the opposition. 
"We were kept away from electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate at the examination," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties. 
"It's a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important that counts the votes, and with us is the executive. 
If opposition members enter parliament, they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into parliament could mean the space on television, meetings in the regions and proposed laws. " 
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt vis-à-vis Russia, enters into crisis, and that we do not reforming, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process not recognize the validity of the ballot. 
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the widespread Voter Turnout (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations. 
"You've noticed that there was an election you? Queries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year. 
There was nobody in the polls. 
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those who are best suited to power. " 
The silence of the night falls on the place in October. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success. 
The interview - Blood returned safe 
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Quebec has become a supplier of the safest blood and efficient in the world. 
And most importantly, he regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, national reserves managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever inquiry, which aimed to clarify the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster never happens again. 
While the Krever delay in filing its report, while some provinces have set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate. 
In the wake of reports Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve the Quebec and Canadian blood supply for all other provinces and two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public, "she says proudly affirm before the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec. 
Dr. Décary Keep in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile." 
From its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, there were in Europe at the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said that holding the fort since its founding in 1998. 
"And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood. 
It was then supported on one of the main recommendations and reports Krever Gélineau that when we do not know that a serious illness and may result in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, instituting action exclusion. 
In April 1999, has refused the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. " 
In 1999 appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which were based on tests used previously. 
The TAN helped to shorten the silent period, which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in blood by our technical specialist explains. 
It was able to reduce that period to less than one week. 
It has thus been reduced substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and we can not detect them. 
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion. 
Today, a person over 12 million at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"In other words, this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Quebec distributing each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before that occurs a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product. 
I think we can now feel comfortable to receive or to prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health, "said the CEO of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know what disease will emerge in the system. 
As recently as last year appeared on the island of Reunion Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr. Décary before emphasize that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply. 
"The needs are increasing as the population ages. 
The treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood. " 
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over the eligibility criteria may yet give blood every 56 days, six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria is rife, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew members of the network of donors as they get older and can not donate their blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors. 
Life today is so rampant, there is rarely time to place an hour to give his blood "is sorry Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, the eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages also the only bank cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia. 
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the bank thousandth of our sample of cord blood and is expected to draw more miles per year. 
We should start to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary describing this program from cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mothers are disappointed not being able to access" because Héma-Québec can not afford to offer this program complex and expensive in all hospitals in Quebec. 
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs for the first division of USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, Yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the series quarter-finals in total goals at the Stade Saputo.

In brief - victorious But Kovalev 
The trio of Canadian number one is ready for the season. 
The unit consists of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a gain of 3-2 Canadian firing dam face the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.

Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
I have another match to feel at ease. " 
"He tried to do too much in the first period, Guy Carbonneau noted. 
But I think he appreciated the end of the match. 
He had a nice ovation. " 
Charest placed on the North 
The prime minister does not call an election before the end of the year 
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest visited yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) tries to get elected at the 'election today. 
"Pushing the limits of our last great frontier of the north" This is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Levis Yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, had projected a kind of mill images. 
Tournament loop on three huge screens, dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec saw "Google Maps", maps, etc.. 
As the mass media during elections. 
In the press, moreover, the Prime Minister has refused to exclude it would trigger elections this fall, although he noted that his schedule was very busy. 
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labor with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been a presentation. 
The Prime Minister has however merely explain why the North was "a jewel in the immense potential", but did not give due amounts of investment, or specific priority in future projects. 
At most a few avenues that could be further developed: including hydropower, forest, but the mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This' territory twice the size of France "," is with us is Quebec. 
Not only is with us, but us, "he insisted, as well to show he wanted national founding myth. 
The province has built much in his relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, engineering Quebec, James Bay. 
"We, our future," he added after a pause for theatrical contemplate the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, "said Prime Minister at the press briefing. 
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated. 
There is a border line on which there is no agreement for a very long time and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position there on behalf of government, "he said. 
Moreover, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North", he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, to be held throughout the year due to melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupied territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful against them and that the project would benefit, especially to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member Ungava PQ), have already started consultations with thirty communities. 
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place started work. 
The Prime Minister does not a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but when "we give a common vision." 
Northern Development would also consistent with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described the "vision" as in continuity with that of Liberal prime minister who preceded him. 
"As the Liberals who preceded us, we thought otherwise to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been a recurring theme of the weekend, which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout. 
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa made the James Bay, our party has managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest . 
In the press, it cited another reference, conservative as this, the "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the proposed dam hydro-electric Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that its operation was planned for 2012. 
"It is us, but I plan to be," he told activists, prompting home of applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, what the law permits. 
He stressed that his schedule is filled, however, including a mission by the Federation Council in China and a top Quebec-New York. 
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader a platform containing resolutions nationalists, including "constitutional aspirations" which rose as a letter in the mail: the PLQ calls in particular the recognition the "specificity of Quebec in the Constitution. 
It also wants the Quebec appoints members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the opposition side, we welcomed the outline of the Map North with skepticism. 
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has emerged the policy development of Northern Quebec that the government had launched Landry in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal government coming to power in 2003, has waived the application. 
Had he done so, "it would be more advanced today," said Ms. Marois alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot which takes place today), Françoise Mercury. 
The ADQ has supported the adoption of a Plan North by the government. 
"But what we want is that it is not just a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today. 
Letters - A country dishonored 
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice "(oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed last summer to say Louise Arbor it was a" shame "for Canada. 
Jeter and stigma on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on itself. 
We are before a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national locked in the concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay. 
A government which ignores the fact Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes he is charged. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denying his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, for the record, as UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it receives a fair trial in Canada. 
This same government turns a blind eye to torture: it is just a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of abuses. 
It does not yet, but we are seeing right now a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our democracy ", the word that Harper continues to brandish and if that sounds hollow in his mouth . 
Now comes the time when there are no more moral: it can bully, torture, arbitrarily detain a Canadian citizen at the whim of a head of a minority government so far (what will happen so after 14 October ...). 
Number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, the Law and Order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here in this renunciation, and not elsewhere. 
Opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold 
In its edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Continuing a Orwellian logic, it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit against six million three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate" . 
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they find, especially in the case of defamation, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this difference is completely overshadowed by Mr. Garver. 
For, Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate it would lead to the ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to hers? 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and combat, playing very patchy, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining. 
The tactics in the unequal struggle, is often ruin the defendants to impose a settlement to silence the opposition in addition to frighten anyone who dares to look back on the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate is the public before it should have presented his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in several countries where working Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not with batons. 
It was thus sufficient to mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding for independent research teams that could shed light on the issue . 
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the perpetrators of Black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr Garver could he explain how he can both claim a debate "public" while disregarding the views of that same audience? 
In the world of Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only high priced lawyers and not all Canadians are a rather narrow concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics were right to speak. 
What does not - or will not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada is primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of mining. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just Moreover filing a notice against perpetrators of Black Canada to cease their intima use of the term ...). 
Beyond the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society. 
It denies, collectively, the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work. 
While it is impossible to study and discuss subjects unpalatable to wealthy corporations in the world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution repeatedly, which can do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open debate and transparent, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada. 
She has a right of reply. 
Academia, to which we belong, has long been managing the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The continuing disproportionate Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to its claims, she did not want a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place limiting devices such frivolous. 
Rescue Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billion U.S. dollars to curb the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress. 
It provides a better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment and a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following a marathon two-day negotiations. 
"We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective on the market," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done in order to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect that would cause another failure on the mood of investors. 
The deadline we had given was the opening of markets this morning. 
Associated late in the negotiations, the two presidential candidates were American rather support the agreement, without fail, however, to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this end. 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly to enable owners to keep their homes and on the wages of surviving leaders of enterprises by the state. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves of American television. 
Asked about another channel to vote for whether the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so." 
"The outline that I read [show] that is something we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said. 
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts, assets at risk and unsaleable U.S. financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles (PCAA) and lead to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derail the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
To round off the corners for everyone to Congress, it has also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help recover his bet. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion which could add another 100 billion if the President deems necessary. 
The other payment of 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange for its support, Washington will get stakes in companies that rescued him earn dividends if profits and that it will sell when the storm has passed. 
The federal government will be able to delay proceedings seized on housing attached to loans under this plan and to set limits on compensation and severance packages paid to executives of companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued to rise yesterday against the project, both in the Republican camp as a Democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," said the address to his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not one that is to take advantage of taxpayers. " 
Convenor of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus skeptics," the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize, we have written to tell us: we ask the Congress not to hurry and scrutinize the way forward," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, Europe had once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis to 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion U.S.). 
The intervention of governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would acquire its rival in full sinking since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S.) in the crisis-risk mortgages in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In return, we get the right to vote at the bank and influence. 
It's just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times ahead. " 
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed on track to nationalize another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press the government to endorse all loans outstanding in the bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S.) in real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
Its beauty in the eyes blue card was long asset, some would say his weakness. 
He was released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor in charming smile? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and talent that flowed from the source will also be removed from the register of power that gives birth to the real sacred monsters. 
But what substantive great rider! 
Paul Newman, who died Friday, aged 83, as a result of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of years splendor. 
Less monumental that Brando, who looked and it was long a rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions. 
The mixed blood children are often magnificent. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin. 
European roots of those born a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive ego, the ultimate mark of quality. 
Because it will project a country-loving self made man, fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, which in the early 50s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before triumph of theatrical, television, cinema soon. 
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ranks second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, albeit a member of a couple model formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with it the shadows of the secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to splinters of show business, which has not quite penetrated the enigma. 
An honest man in the noblest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman brought vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while its major roles collide on the black screen memories. 
More than half a century of a seventh American art changing scrolls through it. 
Rush back into memory the cowboy charming Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), it evokes its sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all its promises. 
So many others are Paul Newman past to history. 
The boxer Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956. 
This malfrat friendly in brillantissime The Sting (The Sting), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Billiard player bitter and vengeful in the magnificent The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the character on the return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who in 1987 won him his only nine Oscar nominations. 
This face throughout the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
Eras jostle through its journey. 
Young people know him mainly through the cult of Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey unorthodox. 
His fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy Coen brothers. 
With a last role of godfather of the mafia Irish Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed. 
At against several legends of cinema that lâchèrent early trade, Newman will be long remained in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered, not without humor, "as a living challenge to" underplaying "judging his performance too supported. 
The profession has not always been tend to the beautiful Paul Newman roles who fell while long cooked in its beak. 
He played less often than young first marginals: neurotic, alcoholic bastards or desperate, with its perfect traits reflected the excesses and revolts. 
As director, Newman revealed little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, draw a portrait female end of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott overdose he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of modesty and sadness. 
Among the tributes rain yesterday on sweeping Newman, his great friend and former companion in arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better. " 
Generosity, love of life are features vibrant actor disappeared. 
Beyond his legendary career, also erased a large activist for civil rights, ecology, the independent film, a protestor excesses of Hollywood. 
We saw a lot on his hoe sit jars of salad dressing, sauces, biscuits and other food, judging the process fairly tasteless, although gag at the outset. 
Profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on its myth, has embarked to the end. 
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good fortune. 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the trail of an American artist so lucid and generous. 
Model citizen, in sum and in addition. 
That could well make Zuschlag &amp; Company plant in their bills? 
Soon, Oct. 8, will begin hearings related to the pending criminal proceedings, against Janos Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud in the form of criminal organization, on an ongoing and regular, leading to damage of particular importance. Other charges were brought against them, for example, forgery and forgery. 
According to prosecutors, money from grants, was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, ranged from a share in cash fiatal Baloldal movement and partly in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, also published by the investigating authorities, was to receive money from grants obtained by issuing bills expense, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, the associations did not their commitments . 
According to the indictment, many of the invoices were false. 
For the latter, they acquired books invoices Józsefváros market, while making the stamps in Kiskunhalas. 
For names that would appear on bills, it was decided, among others, during tours in Northern Province of Lake Balaton, by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the deposition latter, it should identify pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model which they realize that they other bills were introduced, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, and the Municipality of the Capital to access grants. 
The majority of bills was created by István Lados and his accomplice András Ori, which according to our information, focused primarily write the records necessary to obtain grants. 
In a circuit-tracking ", a choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association biztos Egyesület Bridge. 
However, according to the manager, he would have been impossible that so many people are here, at the same time. 
In the same way in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the foundation Jövőért Jobb, who later bear the name of a Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, teeming with errors of form and substance. 
A pension, located Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and maximum ten people could spend the night. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers. 
Issuers of bills to the imagination also fell in excess, when the company mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the catering sector. In their accounts, nor the names of Jövőért Jobb, nor did the Hoppe, according to prosecutors. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor has convened and showed him the bills, he knew immediately that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp." 
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that under the bill, one hundred people have stayed there, does not fit, because this institution does that eleven rooms, which are not as up. 
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
Issuers of bills zealous did not have information on travel agencies in Budapest, as part of their choice, but n'organisant as trips abroad. Thus, naively, they said stays in Hungary on bills to pay in cash, which also goes against the practices of the agency. 
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, whereas the benefits on the activities of travel, whose destination is outside the European Union are not charged VAT. 
Similarly, the VAT rate of four invoices on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in order Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the benefits of society do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15 %. In addition, employees of the hotel only issue invoices printed, while the false were written by hand. 
The survey of prosecutors found that "issuers" have also made mistakes as provision stating the transport of goods by road, that the company issuing bills might exercise, given that his profile was as investment advice. 
Moreover, it is also for flaws forms and types of bills inadequate and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of a Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and biztos Bridge have proved false. 
As in the case of the company or Bt Ravenna stage Kunfehértó Sports, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf. 
The counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., Established in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal home. According to our information, this is why the liquidator of the company denies having issued the invoice. 
Invoices deliberately 
Another category of issuers of bills is composed of those who were well aware that they were asked to make bogus bills. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established a bill payable to a foundation Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the company collaborations Kft. was prompted to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
Similarly, cooperated with Zuschlag, the company BioGate Kft., Which is currently under liquidation and in 2003, has issued invoices payable to the foundation Jövőért Alapítvány Jobb, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, totaling about five million HUF, but behind which no provision has actually been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, because the invoices issued were canceled thereafter, but that agencies have avoided mention in their accounts. 
The next category of companies issuing bills is that companies directly related to the defendants. 
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director General of the Delta Trio Kft. Dealing with trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, where it was found, was Iván Kubatova. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, totaling about 18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, these equipment were purchased by the company Cash Investment Kft. Kiskunhalas of which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, who Iván Kubatova have also received documents connected with the company between 2002 and 2005. 
From what we know Kubatova acknowledged during the investigation it has issued invoices to order companies Atlasz, Hoppe and a Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and he bagged against their value. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatova as masons Romanian companies have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Bt Investment 
In fact, none of these companies operate, what the accused explained by the fact that they were not working. 
He used even when these companies, because at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, and co-editor of acts of fund companies, he established their names invoices, order associations relating to Zuschlag, Atlasz as associations and Y-Generáció. 
Kubatova gave bodies, 15 in total bills issued by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Linaxtrade and Investment, valued at 14.2 million HUF. 
The prosecution believed that 10% of the amount shown on the invoices and the VAT went into the pockets of Kubatova. 
The man has even used the company szi Bt-Beri to establish fictitious invoices that were used in the application of biztos Bridge. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have introduced a grant application to the public agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). 
They got this grant for a total of 500,000 HUF twice, but these amounts have not been used for the purposes specified in the application. 
To avoid this knowledge, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA. 
Moreover, these bills were found during the search conducted in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, some of the allegations concerning the method of manufacturing the bills, as it did before the prosecution earlier. 
This could be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story. 
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, although it has promised repeatedly to tell every detail, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in exchange for repayment of a large part of fifty million HUF, Zusi would only hat. 
Today, it is probably upset because the applications for placement under house arrest, based on an easing of conditions of detention, continually falling in deaf ears. 
While those who have caused much greater damage, and perpetrators of economic crimes not repairable, walking freely or at least wait until their own home the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility. 
The psychology of bidding: Why Does spending more money on? 
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the goods. 
The researchers in neurology and economics from the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this behavior known and seemingly irrational. 
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dropped at this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, which is why they prefer to pay a price too high. 
This research has attempted to draw a diagram Neurological this kind of "game" using experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers played the lottery, while another group took part in an auction playful, while in the process using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers analyzed the active brain areas experimental subjects. 
In both games, participants could make money, but during the auction which is essential to outbid a third, all located in the brainstem, called the striatum, moved to so intense at the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is due to the leak before the violent reaction in the striatum. 
In support of their theories, Members economists in this group of researchers have continued analysis of financial supervision. 
During these three groups outbid facing a partner in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the control group in the real value of the product in question, and they have made their bet. 
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they win the game, then they would receive $ 15 extra, as a reward. 
While the third group had received the 15 dollars before the auction, but the group also lost the money, where they lost the auction. 
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was on with one victory, while at the other on failure. 
In proving the hypothesis neurologists, members of the team players "against failure" were willing to put higher than those made by the group and control group "for the victory." 
"These results can not be demonstrated by any existing economic theory. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions by the pleasure of winning and parade before the risk. 
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two leading theories now on a third explanation. "- Found Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: where do we consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death. 
An estimated one hundred miles patients with hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles after treatment. This is because patients often do not know they are infected. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver caused by different viruses. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are typical, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other. 
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (eg food or water contaminated), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva). 
For travelers, it is anyway recommended to be vaccinated against the virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C. 
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor physical condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea. 
Then develops on the skin and white of the eye visible jaundice, stools become clearer and urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks. 
Throughout the world, each year a million people die from the most serious form of the disease, like cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
Most patients do not know the virus reached because the pathogenic gene destroyed so insidious liver cells. In many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years. 
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattooed. 
Currently, there figure to 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult his doctor from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented. 
On 30 September is the Day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver caused by viruses, on the causes of development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
Whoever believes in God, it feels less pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief function as a kind of analgesic, which has already helped to make more bearable the death of Catholic martyrs. 
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at the University of Oxford have made an interesting experience in analyzing what level the belief in God could influence tolerance to pain of human beings. 
As part of that experience to say the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and atheists all have been subjected to electric shocks, while each of them was a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, believers Catholics have been able to exclude a large portion of suffering. 
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate that part of their brain responsible for regulating pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians involved from different sectors of the university. 
Specifically, the experience goes as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating ECT is fixed on the left hand of experimental subject. 
The researchers asked participants to the experience of watching a sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, Lady with an Ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century . 
Researchers at the root of this experience hoping that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of the Da Vinci painting, not very different from the first, was on his calming effect. 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 electroshock in four successive party, while watching paint or religious theme, that theme is more general. 
Catholics have stated that the sight of the Virgin Mary, as they felt "safe" as someone who is "taking care" and had "calmed down, and peace has invaded." 
In order to paint religious theme, they accounted for 12% less pain when watching the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who had himself participated in the experiment think we can achieve the same effect with any other strong image among atheists, subject to finding the appropriate picture. 
"We should find a picture against which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of such research. 
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," added Wright. 
After these excellent results there remains the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain topics if it is shown to believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber? 
Does the sight of a Virgin Mary better cause better results? 
You are what you disclose about you 
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that can be found at the bottom of the pockets of people like the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interests. 
It is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, an influential persons in society. 
While in regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror Orwell, they do not precisely the essence of Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, not long ago, the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can not meet their original objective sounded as follows: "collect in a system all the information in the world." 
According leader Google questioned, after ten years of work chamboulement world, they are still early days of their targets to treat all information. 
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the m'irait work best?". However, the software can respond to this kind of question, simple at first glance, that the day they know enough about users. 
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that searches for and then pages viewed by those interested are specifically listed. 
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they have searched, what they clicked. With this, long-term recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to respond much more personalized, and we will be presenting products and services based on our previous statements and our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what is my work? ask users who are concerned about seeing the information monopoly of Google. 
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company that can create fear, but not remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly revolt against the power may raise one against Internet-reaction. 
It is however a fact confirmed that the search terms are not only saved, but in justified cases, they are transferred to a third party, and in such cases legal, nothing protects personal rights of Internet users. 
The most resounding of recent times is probably the coordinated action against pedophiles Brazilian, during which Google sent the Brazilian government the information it had gathered on the public called Orkut, allowing identification. 
Customers concerned about human rights could breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm below the body of legal protection electronic EFF has proven right in court to face FBI. According to the verdict in the future, Google may still not be bound by any point of the constitution to disclose information about secret FBI demand of any kind whatsoever. 
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that he had won compared to strengthen the law on child protection, passed several years ago. But in the end account, it fails to obtain lists of users of research, or the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.) 
The trial of Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear the transmission of personal data because they think their intimate sphere and private domain suffer when they start to use Google services. Therefore, they tackle them in the spirit of revolt that protest against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wild" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of large companies, the corporation connected ", by opposition to his rival, Microsoft, cataloged as invading the world because of Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users to identification code do not request money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, more young and cool, at the practice of official software giant. 
The reason may be that geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what Web 2.0, the key word as proclaimed in recent years, drew just behind him. 
Indeed, Web 2.0 is not anything other than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us and that we use communication channels available to us, and while the size of these change one by one, much remains the same: we face. 
A young, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages of Facebook to Xanga, and it can even link them to other benefits, for example Twinter or last.fm, listing his musical habits . Then it can connect them to a system of prosecution, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, which automatically appear in their most recent photo galleries they store on Flickr or Picasa. 
While we may be aware of many examples, like the girlfriend who's easy to view photos of the morning taken by the circle of trusted friends, with whom his friend infidel spent the evening or the the company that fired an employee, just for the heartfelt opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is completely reconsider the our day. 
He who lives a life online, consists of what he shows himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of young people today. 
He wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass the monopoly of Google, can do (starting, for example, with Scroogle using Google search, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace ). 
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, not least. Google's services online, from word processing to image processing, reading information can be replaced with alternative versions that are not attached to huge fleets of servers and n'assemblent not our best profile, which existed until now. 
The public expects, not really hide it, when Google unveiled its true nature. 
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM ($ 140 billion), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). Areas advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten sales of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at speeds of more and more important cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs. 
However, observers are critical, besides all this, contradictions have dramatic effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, protests from employees, after it has doubled the price of Kindergarten and business after the company was deemed too expensive restoration multiple daily prize anytime. All this seems paltry next to that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the taste and interest of the Chinese regime. 
According to an internal rules of society, new services are not announced until they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years ahead, they will get the world on new items. While some believe that the scanning and archiving of books and magazines Google dimensions so important that the company will soon be faced with the Supreme Court of the United States, others tremble before its system Health, because it can build a full medical benefit from our previous test results, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google set up a genetic database can give a good raw material for the next generation of writers of science fiction. The famous novel of Cory Doctorow, writing halftones Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached so outrageous alone through the data from Google.

"The police summoned two minors for questioning in the case of double homicide OZD. Based on suspicion they helped to remove traces of crime." - Said the spokesman for the Department of Borsod Commission. 
The youth admitted the facts against them. For now, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, which, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Télégraphique Agency) are young girls, defend free. 
The complicity of murder can result in a detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect double homicide OZD, a local young man age 23, was remanded in custody on Sunday. 
The charges against him are multiple homicide committed with premeditation and interest. 
During the investigation it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not settle its debt and for this reason that attracted his creditor, last Wednesday in a OZD site where he killed, and the granddaughter of the man, aged 9 years . 
According to information from the MTI, the young man had premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he would commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of that. 
The police investigate the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made a proposal for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange 
The Stock Exchange Warsaw has proposed two hundred million, about five billion Czech crowns for the acquisition of 100% of the package of shares of the stock exchange in Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the stock exchange in Warsaw, confirmed the proposal that the Poles had made despite earlier Czechs have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state. 
99% of the shares are owned by the Polish State which wishes to secede from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity. 
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid that has been made for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic bourse, the Stock Exchange in New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner the least good and did not exclude that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future. 
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by specialists of the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold. 
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of holdings, followed by 14.7 per cent of the bank Ceska Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 per cent. 
The financial crisis in terms of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday on the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, newspapers leaders of the European press already address a second Sept. 11. 
"The overall financial disaster, we must at the U.S. president" - accuses the Rome daily La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to rally his own party behind a bill, improvised in a rush, aimed at rescuing a desperate situation ..." 
In place of a new Pearl Harbor, as referred to the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second Sept. 11. 
Part of the Madrid press is also the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, the failure of political leadership there, which led the world economy on the brink of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing each day, and thereafter, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote of congress, a real danger threat, that that Washington does not propose a policy tool to address the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations took place. 
We can not ignore the threat any longer - stresses the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva. 
Some states may even extend a lifeline to their financial stumbling, and with money from their taxpayers, they can save it from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing like dominoes, then neither the financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient. 
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union are few cases of their national egoism, and centralize control over the financial markets divided. 
Just Monday, weakened financial organizations have received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, adding that fears that European taxpayers will also have to hand in the pocket, very deep, similar to the U.S. in order to address the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really handled the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, from end, the old continent. 
The "rescuers" must not wield any of Suites Center billion euros, against it would be wise if they noted cases in which it would be rational to touch the money of taxpayers, with the goal of preventing larger damage. 
The Smart car mimics the flight of bumblebee 
Which method would be better to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of a detector of obstacles existing in nature? 
For example, that of bees. 
In the draft presented at the surprising CEATEC, held in Japan, bees buzzing gave the idea of strategic departure for engineers at Nissan, for inspiration on how they should design the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a self-operated robotic bio-inspired type BR23C, which he equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal of encouraging developing a system capable of avoiding all obstacles. 
At its flights, each bee is its own space, oval, which in reality is very similar to our secure protective shell - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, director of research and development department and relationships Public Technology of the mark. 
The faceted eye of the bee plays a role, since it can see in all directions in an angle of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye-faceted, engineers have addressed the idea of laser rangefinder. 
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, it assesses distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor board, which turns it into evasive maneuver immediately. 
The perception of the obstacle occurs in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of a bee, immediately change the direction of the wheels by turning an angle sufficient to avoid the collision. 
Unlike existing systems, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively. 
"Were this not so, the mini robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory and Mobility car robotised project. 
It must react instinctively and instantaneous, since this technology is the most vulnerable and most inside the protective sheathing, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
This process should reflect what the bee made to avoid the other bees. 
The process must take place at a glance. 
Unlike bees, the difference can not go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels are turning. 
In this way, instead of endless combinations that have the bees to prevent other bees, in our case, it could not use the rotary motion, acceleration and deceleration as the maneuvers available to the mini Self robot 
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose concentrated energy is larger, making them last longer than in the lithium-ion. 
According to Andoh, the smart instinctive reaction which is paramount, not data processing, much less the capacity to store. 
This mechanism should address a few signals per second, and react to them. 
It is not necessary to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continues. 
We do not need a memory capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes. 
This is the first step towards designing a technology for avoiding instant. According to estimates by Nissan, this system will enter in cars manufactured in series in the next ten years. 
Another application might be incorporated in the satellite navigation system GPS, so that it can guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles in its path. 
It was even given a name for the baby unaffordable 
The written version of the economic rescue plan of 700 billion dollars to repurchase the douteux credit banks, and use it several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half of that sum will be spent. 
Reuters announces that during further discussions extending until midnight Saturday local time on the east coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the rescue plan a total of 700 billion dollars. 
"We conducted a major step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which will only bring agreements on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however, other measures must be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the wheels of the economy in the opposite direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 20h local time in Washington (ie Monday to 2am, according to local time in Central Europe) But did not cause a dramatic rise in scholarships. 
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote the bill, called the law of emergency economic stabilization of 2008. Then his fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are pleased with the advanced attacks that night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
In addition, the program differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she said the $ 700 billion should be spent only once, for the purchase of securities on credit doubtful. 
Now, more than half of the sum of 700 billion may be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of legislation by Congress, probably Monday. This amount will be used first to Treasury Secretary to purchase bad loans from banks, while the use of 100 billion dollars will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will take part too. 
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat to develop a combined strategy: it may, at the same time, buying bad loans, securities on mortgages and mortgage loans and other types of claims " Toxic. " 
The people of the Ministry stated that the repurchases may take place in an auction, but also directly. 
The rule makes it possible for companies to take part in an insurance program, where the secretariat of the Treasury ensures the tools at the root of concerns for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the tools necessary to spend 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether large redemption of doubtful receivables, their insurance, or avoid the risk that the system led to the collapse of one or another major financial institution. 
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for law enforcement, once it is signed" - he said. 
However, leaders of banks located in poor posture and awaiting assistance from the State can expect their pay, simply called golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The salary cap is mentioned only in specific cases. In addition, the limitations depend on how the secretariat of the Treasury offers assistance to business. 
The cap means that if the purchases of Treasury through an auction, they will implement an additional tax on golden parachute, unless the bank discredited president to retire. 
Directly after the purchase of bad loans the government to intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not an exaggeration. 
For the image is complete, it should be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap applies only to new contracts, in order to motivate participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal ceilings will be in effect on the salary of general managers - said the committee chairman in charge of financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank . 
In addition, the state provides a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of diminishing taxpayers, they may even be winner in the matter as soon as the economy and with it saved the banks back on their feet. 
The bill states that within five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there were obviously those who have expressed their doubts over the plan. 
This does not mean that American citizens have mandated, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the member Republican of California, Darrell Issa. 
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kapture think these are the same people who urge the taking of measures, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Sunday, Barack Obama as John McCain, presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties have assured their support to the government's rescue of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. 
After marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration have finally announced Sunday at dawn, they reached agreements in principle on the plan to rescue banks. 
This financing plan, aimed at unfreezing of the crisis on Wall Street and the credit market paralyzed, has become the central issue in the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are the same, each more suited than another to lead the country out of economic crisis. 
According to the latest polls, with the prominence of economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. The advance of McCain, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, melted. 
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress act quickly to vote on the rescue plan of 700 billion. 
He stressed that the proposal contains passages of consumer protection that also supports. 
"Now is the time to act with responsibility (...) danger threatens your job, your savings, entire industries and stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.

Press review of the territory German language 
The right side is intact, only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - and it evoked the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in Bavaria countries. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the Internet edition of news magazine left German, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution devours its Bavaria fathers." 
According to the agreed political, erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Huber-Beckstein duo takes its duties. 
The Christian Socialists have turned Bavaria for decades and now these are modern people turn their backs. 
This change of era is also the matter of Christian Democracy, and thus also that of Angela Merker. 
For CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, came to an end a process that was likely that there are just ten years the undisputed hegemony of the national party has completed. 
There is this decade, in 1998, the CSU is collected with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the fifties, with a score below the level of 50 per cent. 
This was repeated three years ago in elections to the Bundestag in 2005, ie at the time mentioned the so Stoiber. 
The cause may be attributed to modernization "devouring his parents", established in the region so consistently by the CSU. 
It has been 40 years that sociologists have announced that they were misled about the strong pace. However secularization, educational outcomes and the establishment of German north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of voters CSU. 
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right side is intact, it is inside the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and stubborn. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks, this is precisely the classical groups of citizens who are rather far from the CSU, such as independent craftsmen, owners of the ferry and graduate degrees. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his article titled "Who? Who? The party chairman be held on reserve to address the coalition, the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the domestic political confusion that was installed after elections Austria. 
The Socialists Austrian SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives in the Academy. 
The ÖVP SPÖ forbidden to meddle in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. The Greens do not yet agree on the coalition. 
The elections were held now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, the party leaders have barely glimpse leave their cards. 
Faymann Werner, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the Academy. 
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and social partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he mentioned, the orientation Schüssel-Molterer was in any case dismissed. 
A replica of this combination is out of question. 
Molterer reacted cautiously to proposals reds. 
As he said, cooperation will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Academy. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is currently a very open. These issues must be discussed within the Academy. 
Jörg Haider, the chairman of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals. 
"To prevent the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of government" - said Haider. 
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, started in Paris for the European Equal Opportunities, with host France, representing the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation to the plenary, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because is a violation of law that affects the Roma children and thus one of the biggest barriers to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand, Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labor, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners as well as the most eminent representatives of the legal protection of civilian agencies and European in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the press office of the Group of the Popular Party Fidesz MP, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions noted during recruitment, Roma lost labor market in the first place, following their low qualification. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and accordingly basic education of poor quality, only a fraction has the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree." 
In addition, Járóka insisted that education as basic right of human beings plays a key role when we must rely on the other fundamental rights. 
Investing in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economies of member countries of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a circle the broadest possible between Roma and non-Roma. 
Indeed, earlier rom a child starts school, the more it increases its chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; by taxes paid from its income and its consumption, it participates in state budget . 
"By their nationality of the European Union, the Roma should be assured of their right to quality education, protection and education of low quality and sectarian." - Lívia Járóka said. 
According to the member, a collaboration of the European Union a goal-oriented and action is needed for immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For that, compliance with the guidelines of existing anti-discrimination and preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy Roma children to participate as citizens with full rights to the future of Europe "- demanded Járóka. 
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" guaranteed to all, the objective of the Summit for equal opportunities in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure single platform to support the measures taken to promote equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and in member countries. 
CSU: grace for a period of transition 
In October that will take the decision on the fate of the deposed duo Huber-Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful failure electoral heads are not yet fallen, and debate on issues of personal summits Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their seats. The question is when will last until the grace? 
The fate of tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of votes by 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of this pair were widely criticized, at least, felt they did not specifically to their seats. 
Through this, they have sought to placate angry members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the tsunami Bavarian "demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
Ago as five years - this is true, yet under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Social-Christian Union won 60.7 per cent, while that one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 per cent of their strength. 
For 46 years, USC has been the "single sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP. 
But the Conservatives still strong in this southern region of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, Vice-President and Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, which initiates discussions in touch with the Liberal FDP, as well as voters Libres, formed along the right values, about a possible coalition government of Munich. 
A foot nose strange destiny has been using the list of electors Libres, enters the legislation Gabriele Pauli, including taking action against Stroiber served as a possible coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then deal harshly very ambitious municipal politician. 
Now, leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and ex-chairman of the CSU, has designated September 28 as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
Monday, Huber has launched some scathing remarks to the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the Bundestag elections to be held in September 2009, Merkel can be Chancellor again if they give up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, who played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hardly hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively of the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What is concerning because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of Social Democrats lasts forever. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukašenko - its rivals: 110 - 0 
No opposition member has entered the Belarusian parliament after elections on Sunday. 
According to Russian observers, this reflects a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures stability and prosperity, while after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is by irregularities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections. 
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million is going very well opposition for many decades, before the elections yesterday, joining the opposition forces called the United Democratic Forces ( ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as chairman for the fourth time in elections doubtful in the footsteps of amending the Constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of some opposition members in parliament. 
In this way, ODSZ abandoned its boycott originally planned. 
The fact that Belarus, dependent on increasingly from Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, because of the political order as an undemocratic Belarus, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive visas entry, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit because of reduced imports of Russian natural gas, increasingly expensive, and contributed to the passage of society BELTRANSGAZ, owner of gas across the country, rose at the hands of Russia. 
The fact that the OSCE, in assessing the campaign focused on the positive rather than breaches, such as the prohibition to stand for a third of candidates for the opposition, referred to a prior appeasement. 
However, the release of the OSCE on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the bulk of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition feels still palpable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and 'Abazzia separated from Georgia. But Russia with Belarus, which form a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories past one month. 
"We made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich in our newspaper. 
According to the opposition candidate for presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that it remains so, despite that "power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, bringing even a single opponent." 
The opposition does not provide for actions to protest the results. Rather it tries to send his message on the need for economic reforms among voters. 
"Of course, we have many worries on that side, we have to print our newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities we put a spanner in the wheel when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of elderly "- Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main result, the layer of retirees the officially supported not really considers appropriate. 
"Because of the debt of countries and rising trade deficit, the collapse of Social Security, 'referring to the silence of a graveyard', is a matter of time" - considers Milinkevich. 
Unlike the politician of the opposition, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, the mission leader of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is that proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters. 
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work." 
Never in the history of Palazzo Chigi, had not been revolving doors for entry and exit of employees. 
But starting today, is effective this new measure against small malignant, and against that points will then drink coffee at the bar during working hours. 
The new anti lazy was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the secretary general of the presidency, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving-door-Brunetta says are a tool to better work with more productivity, more attendance and more services," says the minister. 
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency. 
"It's reformism" further underlines Brunetta. 
Installation in all institutions of the Presidency of the Council fully with the Chigi Palace. 
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even in a symbolic. 
No resistance from employees has been registered, assured the Secretary General: "It is a process shared by employees, and we had the collaboration of all." 
In short, over breakfast during working hours, over coffee and croissant.

And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, Public Administration. 
Italian, "whose dynamic wage-minister says these last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and also the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public employees, have united to challenge the norms of Brunetta decree making use of Codacons. 
"" While the Minister of Public Service slack today data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness-wrote the Consumers' Association-the people of "lazy assets" continues' increase. 
In Italy, thousands of employees in the public correct and productive, met to declare war on illegitimate standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, Tar, it challenges the exclusion of additional allowances in cases of infirmity due to service an extension of time schedules permanently sick worker's home, during which are carried out inspections, and d Other aspects contained in the new arrangements by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Prevention crucial" 
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who remain permanently disabled. 
In 2007, data INAIL indeed confirm that the dead were white about 1,200. 
Figures that reflect the seriousness of the phenomenon which remains a major cause of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides. 
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and resources about this drama, the famous Anmil today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of victims of accidents at work, institutionalized the second Sunday of October. 
"The alarming data Anmil disseminated by, and the tragic events of recent days confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the president, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to Anmil president of the National Association of maimed and disabled workers, Pietro MERCANDELL. 
The Head of State expressed his "sincere appreciation to the Associative continuous effort towards prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to families of victims and public awareness" 
"naturally outraged, everyone hit the fist to put an end to such tragedies, by their size, raise the cry of the media and participation of public opinion, even if the reality shows us tragic Even repetitive in their dynamics. 
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information ' 
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, assume particular importance for awareness more directly on the part of young people entering the world of work. 
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, does not assess the alarm about the seriousness social, implement and improve legal standards. 
Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini emphasized how "the phenomenon of dead white is a social emergency absolute insult to the conscience of each of us and requires all agencies to make a concrete effort to terminate quickly. " 
The data on work injuries appear to report a slight positive trend, but that does not mean that the number of dead white is still impressive, "said later the president of the Anmil Pietro MERCANDELL. 
"We do not want this' tendency to discount" is translated into fact, a minor attention because it is precisely when attention is relaxed, what tragedy. 
"We believe that in general it is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and contrast can be done through multiple actions." 
"As we emphasized MERCANDELL-plus checks and inspections are required, as a more significant training of workers, and this, from the school." 
- He added-"to do one more effort with regard to communication and public awareness. 
"But we must above all, a greater sense of responsibility of the employers face a phenomenon that represents a social emergency." 
"MERCANDELL then denounced" the progressive deterioration of conditions to safeguard the compensation provided for victims of work "and" drift assistance to which the system is moving in recent years. " 
"The aim therefore is to restore the employee insurance coverage - he said-so that the fate of one who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneous or enlargement of the legislature" 
Mp3 player pointing the finger, they put at risk the hearing. 
Listen to music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to hearing. 
This qu'annonce the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on health risks and unforeseen recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This scientific report-we read in the note it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listening to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more ' one hour per day and per week, may be permanent loss of hearing. " 
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage their hearing unconsciously irreparably" said Meglena Kuneva. 
"" According to scientific pursuits responsible Ue it is a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts most is to educate consumers and make such information public domain. 
We must also review the existing control systems in view of the scientific opinion, so they are fully effective and to monitor new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee, to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and increasing the number of youths exposed to noise that they generate. 
"The scientists concluded the executive-EU-confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission review now with Member States and other interested parties, what steps might be taken to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard of security that limits the noise level of portable music devices 100dB, but the increasing concern about the hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to limit the data that use solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise. 
The EU Scientific Committee noted that users of portable music devices, listening to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level agreed on workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, may be permanent loss of hearing after 5 years. 
Interested 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at about 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we begin in March we finish in June we will draw the money. 
That is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the future of Rome Capital ", which took place this morning at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the council will evaluate the tests and projects, so in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the official stamp "of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The commission is absolutely independent, all political ideas, social, and cultural-are represented wishes to emphasize Alemanno it will propose ideas for development of Rome which will serve policymakers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council . 
No overlapping roles, but only the desire to develop a corner where a major project for Rome. 
In March, she has finished its work and then disappear, as this experience must have a specific time period. 
In June-mayor announces we will present the strategic plan from work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno rejoinder: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is there, as in France through the Commission Attali, like Rome, I am sure his contribution will be crucial. 
Too often politics is beset by management and daily emergencies that arise from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to proceed, and further, to a prospective deeper, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future. " 
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless or a bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the urban Roman, and used to study and engage the best intelligences that express the capital. 
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a draft strategic reference or farm or immobile, to enable our city to improve, what they absolutely need it while thinking about his future now a spirit unit ". 
A future which, said the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual municipal borders, but look beyond" not only in the context of the future metropolitan city and its legal status Capital, but "also compared the role that Rome can and should be, as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama? The first anti-American president. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wishes to move to independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through its decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had reports (as indeed it has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. " 
The attacks against Obama increase while the election date draws closer. 
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition." 
Obama is really cheeky: it believes it will win the highest office of a nation that has a total of two governors and five senators black! " 
In fact, it is attacks that do not say much, they are obviously racial attacks, and do not respond to the question of all voters will be a good president? We also have polls that say all qu'Obama win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, there is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain. 
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot give his vote. 
Qu'émerge This is an aspect of American mentality kept secret until the end. 
"Say what you want, we see ourselves to the cross, on Obama or McCain. 
There are even people who swear: If Obama wins, we will leave the United States. 
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of black candidate seems almost certain. 
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush. 
It asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent replied: Iraq. 
America changes. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 soldiers miles and was sent home kicked buttocks. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make the bags. 
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, the weak point of Bush. 
Who will replace George W will have a huge task to accomplish. 
Usa, the economic collapse is being felt even among journalists in the press, it is time to shed jobs. And many blame the Internet, this "murderous" newspaper. 
Five hundred U.S. journalists were arrested by the Pew Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future. 
However, they did not declare openly committed to information, feel less worried about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as before. 
The problem of American journalists is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a model of economic crisis destroyed. 
In addition, deletions in the newsroom in the room where editors are working on the assembly line newspapers are a big problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the public hears only be reduced significantly. 
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism. 
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists from print newspapers are convinced that journalism at the national level is currently follow a wrong path. 
Locally, the executive is at 65%. 
Print Publishing against broadcast. 
Journalists are not difficult to see where will the web. 
The largest publishing houses will spawn a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer" of newsprint. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to making technology that it hopes "to do something good for their journalism. 
Today, the biggest hitch in American journalism lies between newsrooms that direct-ie directors and reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at the national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, that percentage drops to 23%. 
For some, this is linked to the "security work". 
The directors believe that losing their job in the space of 3 years are 47% nationally. 
As regards the journalists, we go to 30%. 
The "safe" level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
The directors are almost always big salaries, while the editor can win 10mille dollars a month, in addition to retirement and payment of insurance. 
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years. 
But according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
UNIPOL: tribunal ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS A grottaferrata. 
The chairman of the second section of the criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the proceeding of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his hometown, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the instruction on climbing Unipol-BNL. 
At the trial in his office last week, he had obtained the release home transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent could go the route of the provincial town to a house in the capital. 
According to the court, such movement (which has not granted pm) would enable it to influence society and access to evidence that the accused. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already expressed a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and is , more interested in punishing Wall Street to rescue the U.S. economy. 
And it is the New York Times yesterday that we communicate confirms that the current crisis divided the Republican Party, even more divided between its East Coast eve soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington and the world of finance, especially in the powerful states of Central and South. 
The soul, precisely, which was felt so despotic with the vote I spoke at the beginning. 
But what has been mentioned is just one example of changes, big changes that the earthquake foretells ongoing economic or leaves already running: not just the United States, but throughout the West, and may be not only that here. 
In the United States and Europe, the crisis appears to be accelerating the phenomena couvés for some time, so much so that in the new climate, they solidify and prove. 
The first of these phenomena is the update the relaunching special, double category sovereign state, compared to a sort of re-nationalization of the economy. 
The crisis is in fact a crisis of financial-banking institutions which have, of course, close relations with foreign countries, but above all are involved in large-scale assessments of individuals and families living in one country, in a single State. 
This creates an immediate political problem for the government which is to say as respond to difficulties and protests from individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis appears economically but politically World, that here it is almost national. 
The political internationalization seems really offside or had little to say the evidence is provided by the European Union, which shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, can decide no common political line. 
And so is the government of each State expect that all interventions, plans for rescue and recovery, new rules, especially a condition of payment: when going through a difficult period, there was that States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary means and legitimation for use: two resource of inestimable value, of which no market or international organization can never have similarly. 
This new emphasis of the crisis state of the nation is still in perfect harmony with the continuing importance that the major economic latest developments of the economy tend to attribute to a fairly related to this element: territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that now entered the realm of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, equipment failure, convinced that global finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized of a sudden one, that our future should instead settle its accounts with increasingly little material things like water, crops, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another land, but are linked absolutely to a limited space, to a territory. 
So that is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, ie, one who has the misfortune to live in a place with no harvest without oil and water. 
I come now to the second novelty, however, which provides a fracture. 
Who said Territory, State, Government, unavoidably said policy, and therefore Leadership. 
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to convergents produce two phenomena. 
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need of leadership authoritarian search of a person who can take control of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting the existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of gray area. 
And also something deeper, in a sense, even disturbing: a discredited, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness which tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number Country of the West. 
Thus further increases the conviction of various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now at its height, how they listen and be their culture complex in the acceptance of the term, have the same time, and always be more alien to the opinions of majorities. 
in short, demand leadership, so groundwater supplies, a powerful and branched movement to delegitimize the ruling classes and traditional political order, manifested in the "rebellion" or improvised election, in the changes of mood Collective all these recent times, from the rise in Austria conservative Bavaria, the fall of Labor in Britain, the U.S. congress rebellion against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not arrived by chance). 
One has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would have even more difficulty, which is not today Today, understand and thus represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that reinforces the economic crisis, growing agitated and potentially dramatically. 
In view of all this talk about a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, frankly seems exaggerated. 
But they say well, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on walls. 
Breaking the laws of gravity with a super glue and in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman. 
That is the target of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes are almost succeeds. 
With a tape measure just 2.5 inches square, researchers have managed to maintain a body stuck to 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
THE STUDY-The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The equipment, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon called carbon nano tubes. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." Explained Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired feet of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure a perfect grip. 
Tests conducted on various materials such as glass, Teflon, paper and glass, have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of reptiles, and at the same time that it "stands out easily to the wall, "said Liming Dai, a researcher from the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton. 
WALK ON THE WALL? - "This material could be used as temporary adhesive" said Liming Dai. 
May be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers believe to use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic devices, since the carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could include aerospace engineering. 
For now, no super heroes. 
OTHER RESEARCH-The University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated also in search of a new adhesive. 
In an article in the American journal American Chemical Society, researchers in California have introduced a microfiber adhesive trained as hair, which are automatically cleans dust during the movement over an area to ensure a perfect and constant grip. 
Medications: never with fruit juice. 
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple. 
These beverages were consumed primarily because quenching and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain life-saving drugs, alter the absorbent in amplifying or diminishing as appropriate, their effectiveness, even with serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, said the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society under way in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple, to reduce the absorbance of some vital drugs, negating their benefits and putting at risk the health of patients. 
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as responsible chosen to increase the effects of certain anti arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, anti staminales and neurological up toxic levels. 
DRUG RISK-This is the Italian Agency of the drug itself, which had given new in a newsletter dated two years, alerting doctors and patients do not assess the danger arising from this mix and be careful what you drink, if we take drugs such as diazepam or methadone. 
NOT THAT grapefruit-According to experts, even the orange juice and apple contains substances that inhibit the drugs. 
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices. 
From there the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology from the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are usually immediately reported to various national and international agencies of drugs that will need to change the informative notes of drugs. 
It should always read the papers illustrative of the medicines we take, and if something is unclear, not to impress, but clearly go to the doctor or pharmacist "said the expert agency Ansa. 
The Nobel economics at Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on patterns of trade and the location of economic activities. 
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous columnist of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the most critical solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman wrote in an article published on The New York Times, the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences history of the United States. 
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, which was charged to the economist for years, but now has proved accurate. 
"I am surprised and a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, have disappeared from public attention" Krugman said at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an economist of great value, but also a discloser style "very aggressive, particularly criticism of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, is the third edition package of "anti-Microsoft" 
This is the day of release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of productivity aimed at personal touch still getting more users, home office, professionals in public administration, offering a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office. 
Following work of nearly a year, produced by developers voluntary, monitored by Sun Microsystems, the new Open Office package is the general public with various news: the welcome screen and the interface review and become less austere, to other more important as the compatibility born for the Apple operating system Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard. 
Open Office has made special attention to the interaction with Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (. Docx,. Xlsx,. Pptx.) 
Also interesting, some functions specific modules, such as reducing the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF file in module development chart, retaining the original aspect of the page. 
Also on this front, it is possible to create documents "PDF hybrids" that unite the graph of Adobe typical elements of a spreadsheet or a producer of text. 
The collaboration between several people is an element that has various improvements within applications in the spreadsheet, users can intervene, avoiding conflict on changes in the drafting, because every employee is assigned a color commentary for better recognition in the process of revision. 
Some companies are even still working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final. 
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is available as usual in addition to the Linux operating system. 
Upon request, the installation CD can be shipped home or at work. 
And if the theme of free can be a means to disseminate it in the houses, it is in the business, OpenFirmware to Office after trying the great challenge, can already count on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Without counting the realities that offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium enterprises, which could also open to prospective business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for writing the video equivalent of Word, Calc is the spreadsheet to replace Excel, Impress, for presentations rival PowerPoint; Dbase, as the famous Access, is the program to work on databases and finally Drwa is the module chart. 
Goal for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that there are nearly 3 million miles and 600, it is likely that the release of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure 
Kohl also is positive is the fourth case of doping. 
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey for best climber. 
This is the site of daily L'Equipe reported that the new one. 
A 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the third generation of Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests conducted on samples of Kohl are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the tests confirm against positivity to Cera, the Austrian lost his third place in the Tour and will have to ening expect two years of elimination. 
The news of the positive Kohl of the third generation of Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has communicated to the Associated Press, have reported positive to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans was placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, raids and the polka dot jersey for best climber. 
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS IF ITALY IS RACIST? 
Italy "as a country of emigrants was recently transformed into a destination for immigrants" greeted with reluctance. 
This would transform it the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That is what s'intéroge the New York Times who has devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of Abdul young William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box cookies. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those in which there is "more integration and more work" but also "an anti -immigrant's strongest and most important support for the Lega Nord " 
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
not only. 
Even the new legislature intended by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Presidential Palace, requested that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism." 
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room. 
The rental market for students knows no crisis 
According to the latest survey Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, Naples 650, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached some very serious point to exclude whole categories of youth, the right to study due to high overall costs that families need support from-explains the head of consulting firm of Sunia, Laura Mariani-in those cities, demand from students so distorted the market a process of widespread increase was amorcémême to residents. 
In most cases, the location offers also include a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, without limit of rent, subletting. 
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation, are needed to calm prices. 
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that Milan, to a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros, for a single room, there is a minimum 650 euros (Bande Nere area), at an average value of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (area Vittoria) 
In Florence, a bed costs an average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros. 
At Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University must 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, in areas near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), it takes about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
We can not save that if one moves in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple area predestined Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed must be 300/400 euros for a simple, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with prices highest in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
At Bari, bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single. 
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by students outside the Community, there is a further anomaly: the rent asked the students is increased by 25/30% compared to that for Italy. 
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities éliments the historical rooms. 
The historic movie theaters closed for Multiplex. 
"A city without cinemas blind is a city is like a face without eyes" 
The picture offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what happens in major Italian cities, but also in provincial towns, 
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multiplex, and the death of consumption of single rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and undeniable, and it has all the characteristics more a true cultural crime. 
To disappear, it is often historic sites and loaded memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone you know with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions" observes the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, film offers Tornatore there 20 years, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix de la sworn in Cannes, and told the poetry room province, and the nostalgia of a way of life film, may be lost forever. 
The figures provided by ANEC, the main association of traders, want to say these last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and what are the rooms in major cities have largely paid the fees: at least 10 Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, at least 6 in Turin, 5 to Palermo. 
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is leading with 82 single rooms lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The evidence confirms that the first t responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have registered the most new multiplex cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy in the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilia-Romagna. 
"The Italian operation has grown irrationally" notes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but would still ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a room in a farm town, fréquenteurs these are not necessarily ready to go to the multiplex. 
Not to mention the deliberation missed credit for merchants: antecedent debt of the State is about 10 million. 
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral, the Government does not respect existing laws. 
To support the sector should be between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas single rooms of historic centers and peripheries. 
Among the standards laid down, there are tax measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter the restricted area, and will have special pricing for parking and some parking . 
"This is an initiative that pleases me" observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope other cities follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. 
Clearly, however, to contrast the super power of multiplex cinemas traditional should also improve sound quality and image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that for me has always been important: the closure of SUPERCINEMA of Bagheria, my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to "New Cinema Paradiso" which I thought had been 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal Via Nazionale, now closed, where I lived as emotions shared, I turn on the other side not to see signs blackened by dust. 
Links between politics and 'Ndrangheta, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choice of the Municipality's interests Piromalli clan." 
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external for Mafia association. 
The joysticks also Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the government, and his small son lawyer, the same boss, already convicted of criminal association mafia type, and pay 10 million euros. 
"an affront to the legal and moral standards, and especially common sense" prosecutors wrote, the two local governments had expressed willingness to pay to Master Piromalli consultations. 
"So we would have been granted to the clan-write the judge to officially enter inside the town halls facilitating opportunities, already considerable, control and direction of public administration" 
The chairman of the Calabrian regional Agazio Loiero, no secret that "collusion between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his area: "there are places where the mafia is more intensity than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there are many politicians who resist pressure from the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests this morning after those of last July, following which the police have announced decapitated Piromalli clan. 
By the end of April, the council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of suspected packages between organized crime and local government, local politicians were relieved of their duties to administer City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the tie in May 2006. 
He cried scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council. 
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of all Manigance have a political question, but given the demand for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the clan had Piromalli even manages to ask the change in the project of the A3. 
Hence ordered interceptions against Torrione Dal, the write pm, is iceberg "willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a group known close Piromalli, consistent choice of public administration interests of the clan. 
When energy is born of the waves, now the big launch. 
This is an enormous reservoir which occupies over 70% of the land surface and now the major global energy companies are in the process of discovering. 
Waves, currents, tides, these new sources on which giants like Chevron raised eyes, and now try to put your hand. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea is studied years from now, and in the 70s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified. 
When oil prices fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the bodies environmentalists and the new increase of oil provide a booming sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 found that 15% of global electricity needs could be covered by operating systems swell seas. 
This amount would be twice that produced by nuclear plants. 
And in addition, there are currents and tides .. 
Colossi in the attack. 
The first company to capitalize on the marine energy has been the Enersis, which in 2005, in Sigli an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, said it would not a true revolutionary. 
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these companies doomed always to rely on traditional energy marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the technology on energy-oceanic said the spokesman for a company associated with the American oil giant, the economic daily Wall Street Journal and evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us." 
Cooperation in question concerns a permit deliberated by the U.S. Committee for Energy, needed to give rise to a potential of marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting, especially if one considers that just in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there Verdant Power Inc. New York and Ocean Power New Jersey, who traveled the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although details are not known, according to observers indicate a growing interest . 
Tecnologie point to make. 
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, of the fact that marine energy does not dissipate the fears to the environmental impact. 
At the moment systems such as Portugal and some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create big problem to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, use technology with a higher environmental impact. 
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The thrust of the waves, which moves sludge up and down, is converted into a pressure hydraulic pistons and cylinders inside the floats. 
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the bank through marine cables. 
For now, we have four such systems in phase project, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing the energy for a commercial center and a terminal using six underwater turbines in the East River in New York. 
The movement of water during tides, is turning the turbine blades, creating a rotation movement that fuels a generator. 
Verdant have announced a long list of customers waiting for permission to draw energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
Special interest, they say the Research Institute of Electric Power, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides. 
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable source of energy. 
And it is precisely the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, have invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and provides for investments up to 35 million in 2009.
