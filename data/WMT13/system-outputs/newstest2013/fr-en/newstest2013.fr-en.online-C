A republican strategy to oppose the reelection of Obama
The republican leaders justified their political one by the necessity to fight against the electoral fraud.
Now, the Center Brennan considers this last one as a myth, asserting that the electoral fraud is rarer to the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning.
Besides, the republican lawyers inventoried only 300 cases of electoral fraud to the United States in ten years.
A thing is certain: these new disposals will influence negatively the rate of participation.
In this direction, these measures will mine in left the American democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, the American States are responsible of the organization of the federal elections to the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulgated from 2009 of new laws making the process more difficult inscription or of vote.
This phenomenon took extent after the elections of November 2010 that turn to add 675 new republican representatives in 26 States.
Consequently, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right of vote in 41 States was introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws demand that the voters present an identity card with photo and a proof of American citizenship.
Besides, these laws reduce also the periods of vote by anticipation, invalidate the right to register itself as voter the day of the ballot and withdraw to the citizens having a judicial file their right of vote.
Before the elections of 2006, no American State demanded voters to present an identity card with photo.
The Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.
The supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of the Indiana.
Republican authorities hurried themselves to spread this practice to other States.
During the two last years, they sponsored projects of law in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with photo.
It is important to note that, in contrast to the Quebec, the American citizens do not dispose any card of universal identity as the card of the disease insurance.
Of fact, 11% of the American citizens, is 21 millions of people in age to vote, do not possess any cards of identity with photo emitted by a governmental agency of their State.
Besides, five new millions of voters in 2012 do not dispose any such a piece of identity.
Now, it costs some often more than hundred dollars to obtain the card of required identity.
The new restrictions affect in a disproportionate way the young, the minorities, and the people to weak income.
In fact, 25% of the African-americans, 15% of the winning people less than 35 000 dollars; 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the voters of 18 to 29 years do not possess the card of required identity with photo.
Well more.
The students, considered voters as more vote for the candidates democrats, are not authorized in several States to use their identity card with photo emitted by their institution.
On the other hand, these same States authorize the members of the clubs of fishing or of hunt that vote more of the republican side to use to vote the cards emitted by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State demanded proof of citizenship to vote.
The Arizona was the first one to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States adopted exacting laws of the voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the vote Hispanic.
Now, it appert that two voters Hispanics on three favor the party democrat.
Besides, the republican legislators sponsored in 2011 of the laws abolishing the inscription of the voters the day of the ballot in eight States.
Of more, they limited the right of people and of groups to furnish an assistance to the voters desiring to register himself.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, at the time of the general election of 2004, the countries of inscription of the voters contributed to record about 10 millions of citizens.
Now, the adopted measures since 2009 did to fall of 17% the rate of inscription again voters in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
Of more, the republican legislators adopted laws in five other States aiming to reduce the vote period by anticipation.
For example, at the time of the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of the voters that voted by anticipation were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of the voters of the State.
It left of even with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of citizens that voted by anticipation.
In compensation, the white ones that formed 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting by anticipation.
Well heard the legislators democrats and their supporters vigorously opposed themselves to the law adoption restricting the inscription of the voters.
Several projects of law were blocked by the vetos of the governors democrats.
The general lawyer of the United States intervened to suspend the laws more controversial.
They were able to limit in left damages.
For example, only 16 on 34 States adopted laws requiring the presentation of a card of identity with photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules set up undeniably will make the exercise more difficult right of vote in 2012.
The critics democrats denounce the character favoring laws that were voted and they there see an evident objective to influence the results in 2012 in States keys.
A report of the Center Brennan of 2011 shows that the States that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 necessary votes to the electoral high school to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative modifications at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections of 2012.
But a thing is certain: these new disposals will influence negatively the rate of participation.
In this direction, these measures will mine in left the American democratic system.
Screening of the cancer of the prostate: to pass the test or no?
In fact, the test of APS would present sometimes erroneous results, with of false negative results or again of positive false, which one these induce useless medical interventions.
Of what to do to hesitate again more the already reluctant men to pass tests of screening.
Pass the test or no?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the conducted studies to the United States, there were a lot of contaminations between the groups witnesses, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and to have recommendations close.
Another study, that one European, concluded to a mortality difference between the patients that had a screening and those that not in had.
This study also showed, with a followed one after 12 years, that one has between 30 and 40% of more of luck to have metastasises if one is not identified.
I recommend therefore the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if one has a direct parent that already had a cancer of the prostate.
The men of African-American origin are equally more to risk.
The key is to take the good decision once one detected a cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and of others that are indolent.
It is necessary really to do to understand to the patient the degree of risk of his cancer, while offering him the possible options, while treating not necessarily the cancers of the prostate that do not carry attained to life in the long term, and while choosing rather, in that case, for a supervision activates disease.
Today, a lot of men with that one detects a cancer will not be treated, for their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life.
One will suggest them to do the supervision activates and if the disease progresses, one will offer them a treatment.
More and more, one determines with precision of the criteria to decide that should or do not treat.
I recommend therefore nonetheless to pass the test.
But the important one is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine if one should pass it or no.
In collaboration with the international Corporation of urology, Movember created a tool that allows evaluating the pros and cons of the test of APS.

Warn the disease
It does not exist unfortunately any recipe miracle to warn the cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the better means to reduce the risks of about it to suffer.
One considers that if everyone ate well and budged sufficiently, one could warn 30% of the cancers.
"If more no one smoked, this rate would climb to at least 50%", underlines André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Corporation of the cancer.
On the other hand, one evaluates that about 10% of the cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also abodes totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Corporation of the cancer, the fight against the tobacco use remains a priority, despite the decrease of the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of cancer of the lung.
She constitutes also a factor of risk for several others.
That night enormously to the health of the people.
"Again today, there is 1.5 millions of smokers to the Quebec", deplores the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging given: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk to die of a cancer falls half.
The weight
The embonpoint and obesity favor also the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risks of cancer of the breast, côlon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that the uniform practice of the physical activity during all a life protects against the cancer of the côlon", one adds.
The nutrition
The organism recommends equally to limit his consumption of red meat.
In too big quantity, she let the risks climb to be suffering from a colorectal cancer.
The delicatessens also, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by fumage, drying or salaison can induce the formation of substances carcinogènes.
"The latter can damage the cells of the organism and take to the development of the cancer", one explains.
The vitamins
During the last years, several scientists studied the links between the vitamin supplements and the cancer.
Their research are not nevertheless conclusive for the moment.
Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While the one of them noted a decrease of the risks of cancer of the prostate, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of the vitamin D on the cancer clearly is not established not more.
Besides, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance to talk about its worries and of its family antecedents with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, that does not give the cancer."
The boson of peeled Higgs
The announcement of the probable discovery of the boson of Higgs created all an emotion, the last summer, and for cause.
One believes in fact that this boson participates in the responsible mechanism of the mass of any thing in the Universe, nothing that that.
And then, it is a matter of the last particle of which the existence is predicted by the standard Model - our better one, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter - but that again was not observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not again completely sure that it is a matter well of the Higgs.
One knows without the shadow of a doubt that one holds a new authentic particle, and that she resembles a lot to the boson of Higgs predicts by the standard Model.
In addition, of new unveiled data this week at the time of a big congress of physics, to Kyoto, seem to confirm it, but it lacks again of the data for some to be perfectly certain.
Let's suppose all just like it is a matter well of the Higgs, since the luck to cheat itself seem thin, and see of what it is a matter.
There is, in this low world, an inevitably wanting essential law that two things cannot rediscover themselves to the same place at the same time.
Not average to infringe this rule - and try not too strong, you will be done poorly.
Now even if the physics of the particles is a well strange world, it proves himself that she has, she also, a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, that stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space to the same moment if they are in the same "state quantique" - this "state" solid roughly in certain of their characteristics.
Of there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In a corner, one finds good named citizens closed, that obey sagement to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other shake themselves the bosons, one salts band of anarchists that do not have respect for nothing - in any case, for this principle, which means that they are able beautiful and well to find itself to the same place, at the same time.
These bosons divide themselves next in two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, besides) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: the mesons, that we will approach not here, and the "force particles", by which ones the big forces of the nature propagate themselves and to which ones the boson of Higgs would be in a way akin.
These bosons-là, it is necessary to underline it here, are not all of the as exotic bugs as one could believe it.
Indeed, if you succeed in read this chronicle, is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary triteness: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric load accelerates or changes direction, that "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little as a launched stone in a pond.
Of this "disturbance" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrarouge, or ultraviolet one, etc.), and this wave is nothing other that a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "force carriers".
More stable field
It leaves of even with the boson of Higgs, to this difference near that it is another field, the field of Higgs, that must be "disturbed" for that this boson appears.
Now, this field of Higgs is a lot, a lot more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to attain of very, very high energies, a little as if it was a matter of a frozen pond of which only a very big rock could wrinkle the surface.
This is the reason why it is necessary an immense accelerator of particles as the one of the CERN - the Wide Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - To attain of such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the report between the Higgs and the mass.
This are not in fact all the particles, or all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Certain, as the magnets, do it, but of not others - a paper end, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge.
And same manner, this are not all the particles that interact with the field of Higgs: the one that do it have a mass, while the others (as the photon, holds) not some have.
Now, what that "can bring" all these research, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For the science, that serves to verify the validité of the standard Model (MS), and that allows also to the physicists to examine any gap between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
They are besides several to wish fiercely that one finds some, for the least difference could open one concern a "physical new" and certain butchers holes of the Model.
This one, it is necessary to say it, has again huge lacks, not proposing any explanation for seriousness (oups!) or the dark matter, that forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
But one did not find of such gaps to the CERN until now.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these research in the Newspaper of mister and madam Tout-le-Monde, they, are more difficult to predict, but one would be wrong to presume that it not there in will have.
Hold: to the very beginning of the years 60, the pioneers of the laser, in the Laboratories Bell, suspected at all the revolution only their works were going to release.
They glimpsed some scientific applications, but nothing of the remainder.
Indeed, we already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle - that worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that has perfected itself the first continuous laser (the first ones were blown), in 1962 -, at the start the laser rather was seen as a "gadget of labo".
Imagine...
And then, the applications also can originate of all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle perfected a small sensor of light in 1969, during its works in view.
This sensor, although this not at all was sound intention original, serves now of" eye" to all the numerical cameras of the world, and was worth him the physics Nobel 2009.
That does not want of course to say that the activities of the LHC necessarily will transform our lives, but that means that, really, one never knows...
Palliative cares - The better manner to die... | The Duty
With his Commission to die in dignity, the Quebec recently debated delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume under little while a project of law gets ready.
Now, in this essential domain, a lot remains to do.
The To Must attempted there to look at of more near.
Some weeks ago scarcely, Mister L. lived again alone in his apartment of the Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that gnawed it him had left a respite of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I did seven years", he says, mi-figue mi-raisin, lengthened in his bed to the house of palliative cares victor-gadbois, of Beloeil, where it arrived the day before.
"But this is always a shock, one not can be prepared to that", he says.
The disease done his work: a huge weakness that prevents it from go alone to the toilets, and even to eat alone.
Sat at table in front of an appetizing lunch, it accepts leaving itself to help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, it arrives even to smile, speaks with the unknown ones that bustle about around him, bring him its medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My bigger wish, it is that one heals me diarrhea, it is humiliating", it confides.
Some hours later, l" team found a remedy to this evil.
"During our life, one learns that a man, that pees standing", relates Rock Brodeur, psychologist to the house victor-gadbois.
To decline to the stadium of the child, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the capacity of the person" to accept the regression, it notes.
For, opinion of several people working in palliative cares, of big moments unfold themselves to the heart same of this regression.
The patients that enter to the house of palliative cares victor-gadbois suffer all of the cancer.
They have a prediction of life maximum of three months.
At this stage, l" team of doctors and of nurses that the surrounds not extravagant more said cares "curative".
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worse fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease did me to discover my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I no longer have wishes in life", she says, before accepting that one puts him a mask to help it to breathe.
She awaits all all the same, in the next days, a last visit of his come son of Italy.
To victor-gadbois, one extravagant, with a group of volunteer, the cares of the body and the assistance to the nutrition.
It is the palliative cares, that one gives when there is no longer any anything else to do.
To return the more comfortable death.
To the Quebec, one counts a bed of palliative cares for 11 700 inhabitants.
This is very little when one knows that one finishes all by to die a day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dre Christiane Martel, the one of the doctors of the house.
What this be at the level of the physical, emotional or witty comfort.
To death, one will accept lavishing cares of mouth to the brandy or to the Pepsi, according to the request.
The diabetic ones will not held anymore be to check their sugar rate.
And the death is part of the Newspaper.
Last night, one served a beer to Mr. X, deceased during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer to the feet of the defunct one.
"One helps the close as much as the patients", relates Nathalie Savard, director of the cares.
To the house victor-gadbois, the days follow themselves but do not resemble themselves.
Alongside an old man of 93 years that savors his last assembly of family in the course, well wedged in its pillows while one clinks glasses in his honor, a young man of 36 years tragically dies themselves, surrounded by its parents, of his woman and of its two young children, after all to have attempted to survive.
"Since six months, there always is of three to five beds that are occupied by cancerous of age less than 45 years", worries the Dre Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients that are admitted to the house victor-gadbois arrive from their residence, 47% originate hospital.
Access problem to the palliative cares
One says that 77% of the Canadians not have all simply step access to palliative cares, that is to say to conceived cares to appease the suffering when a patient succeeded in the final phase of his life, that this be at residence, to the hospital or in care house.
And several organisms, as the house victor-gadbois and the Corporation of palliative cares to residence of the Big Montreal, specialize themselves more or less exclusively in the offered cares to the cancerous one.
It is precisely this big lack in the Quebec health care that does to fear to several specialized doctors in palliative cares the adoption of a law framing euthanasia and the attended suicide.
Since the months of October, one shows, signed leading experts of the palliative cares of which the Dr Balfour Mount and the Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to indicate their opposition to such a initiative.
According to the Dre Christiane Martel, the system of Quebec health is not rather performance to assure that each will have straight to palliative cares of quality before one accepts proceeding to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient one to pass 14 days to the urgency, in big pains, without one doing the necessary one to relieve it.
I fear that of the not required patients to die that because they receive the adequate cares.
And simultaneously, several oncologues persist on their patients until the last day, despite the worse predictions.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard already were slight when she abandoned a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologue that I stopped the treatment, she replied me that she regretted that I stop beating me, she related.
Nevertheless, she had said me that j" was finished!
Not omnipotent cares
The Dre Martel believes that 90% of the patients that ask to die thank caring for them of not to have attained their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative cares.
But it is necessary well to say that the palliative cares are not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of the pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative cares to the Corporation of palliative cares to residence of the Big Montreal, the patients would be recalcitrant to the treatments against the pain in 8% of the cases.
To the very end of life, the doctors have then often recourse to palliative sedation, that comes back to to put to sleep the patient even at his death, is in a manner sporadic, is in a manner permanent.
One cannot pretend anymore not to hear that party of the suffering.
More and more, the non relieved patient will have the possibility to have this palliative sedation.
The patients that are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die. "
But that wants not necessarily to say "I want that you euthanized me", that wants to say "I want to be relieved".
The realization of this report was rendered possible thanks to a stock market of journalism of the Institutes of research in health of Canada.
Real estate scandals of big extent to the Quebec
Officials of the garbage collection, contractors of the BTP, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia relate day after day which they know of a tremendous one "system", mixing industry of the building, officials, politicians, union and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost very dear to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious as the system crumbles since that one took the big means", is ironic Jacques Duchesneau, representative to Quebec and former boss of police of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal is has burst in 2011, by the bias of an investigation of bottom on the embezzlements linked to the contracts of road works to the Quebec, to which the liberal Prime Minister of the era, John Charest, had consented only to back up.
The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, occult financing of leave and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, it underlines, the only ministry of the transportations would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts", certain curbing their instincts to touch a share!
The Commission Charbonneau "already dropped two mayors", it adds, while hoping that she succeeds in "to show the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent unity anticorruption, created in 2011
Permanent unity anticorruption, created in 2011, itself there hitches also with his army of controllers, investigators and analysts of the government.
More the policemen of "the squad Hammer" that, since 2009, would have driven the "coalition of the sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the contract inflations...
The latter weeks, she proceeded to mass searches and carried accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Layers, mayor of a city of suburbs.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, that has just resigned of his post of mayor of Laval, third city of the Quebec.
It is suspected to have pocketed jars-of-wine to repetition in exchange for public contracts.
Definitely are accused besides engineers to the garbage collection of Montreal and contractors of Italian origin, of which Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter did sensation while explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of achievement of public contracts.
Poured itself during years 3% of the value of the obtained contracts to Montreal to an intermediary one linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed to all winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euros) to on the part provincial, especially to the then in power liberals.
It acknowledged also to have organized a collection of illegal funds for l'ex-vice-premier minister liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of sewers of which it inflated the costs
To Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked efficiently.
Surprising Gilles, former engineer in civil engineering, well detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, it received businesses of construction gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, games of hockey and jars-of-totaling wine 736 000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts of which it inflated the costs.
Of other officials of the garbage collection acknowledged to be done themselves to grease the paw while inflating of 30% to 40% the bills, by of first rate false.
Then an organizer on the part mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately to have closed the eyes on a parallel budget supplying its cash registers with money salts.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Roll was the one of the first elected officials of Montreal to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebels herself as early as 2010 against the municipal sale of a land bought 5 millions of dollars and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% of money salts in the election campaigns
Investigation that finally will be set up, she says that she "pulls on an allowing wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the corrupts and pin the faulty ones".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
One is cleaning the wound but it would be necessary a unity of investigation peculiar to Montreal and an eve, in order not to to see to return the doubtful practices.
As one does the housework.
Uniformly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes of his side that "officials flew of the hundreds of millions of dollars", but worries especially role of" elected during the course of stratagem", when they did not soak in trick!
Estimating to 70% the party of money salts in the financing of the election campaigns to the Quebec, it is ironic: "One said me that it is only a pale reflection of the reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to 100 dollars the gifts to the parties but that will not change the data, according to him: "As long as one will limit not strictly the electoral expenditures, there will be money salts in political."
Him advocates a revision completes system of granting of public contracts and of financing on the part: "One cannot go lower; go at the far end of the things, with courage, will allow rebuilding the house on solider bases, with more of check and of laws."
If this history tarnishes the international picture of the Quebec and of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those that in laugh to look at in their own course...
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new breadth with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
One can explain it by a taken one of individual conscience but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Of big players arrived.
Every day, I progress to their side.
The technical staff equally a lot brought me.
To the Newspaper, these elements urge me to hoist my game level.
And, in game, this is easier.
All goes very quickly in the soccer.
But I do not catch fire.
Of my beginnings to the center of préformation of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Holy etienne, I always advanced by bearings.
You pull therefore profit of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The exhausted ones of this summer are got used to to dispute games of very high level.
They know as as every training is crucial.
Which means that a player as me wants to face and to furnish the maximum.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot as for my positionnement.
It is supported by assistant as Claude Makelele, that played same post that me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires the respect with all the technicians.
Today, it does not have any equal in League 1 and is part of the better European trainers.
It has a big experience and won a lot of titles with upper-crust clubs.
It mixed with big players.
I think that it will win others entitle to Paris.
In January, I had had a consoling discussion with him.
I went out then of a series of injuries.
The confidence that it grants me explains also my performances.
Which look do you concern the first party of season of the PSG?
In League 1, Lyon took us the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the League of the champions: we qualified ourselves for the 8ES of final one with the manner.
Which is the objective of the club in this competition?
One will try to go the further possible one.
Henceforth, all can arrive.
But one will have our word to say facing of very good European teams.
We want first to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the time of the 8E of final return.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short one run?
It already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and be in line with itself the length.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for that this project becomes real.
In League 1, not to win the title, as the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would represent a big disappointment.
This year, one has really to heart to pocket this title of champion.
The last season, one is not passed far.
In May, there was disappointment for one had the qualities to finish first.
One did a very big season.
One finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, realized an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think that this is the good one.
Even if the big teams as Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux are at the fight for the title, I think that one has the weapons to take it.
Do you consider that the media await too much the PSG?
It is normal that one awaits a lot of us to the view of what was invested and players that one has.
One accepts it totally.
After, when one wins 4-0 to residence against Troyes and that one finds again things to reproach us, it is sure that this is a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people await of more.
One will never be able to win 4-0 all the weekends.
One is not the FC Barcelona!
One tries to set up a project of game.
A team constructs itself with the time.
One proved in League of the champions that one could reply present.
Look at Manchester City that does not arrive, since two seasons, to qualify itself for the 8ES of final one, they also did huge expenditures!
To the look of the are invested, one imagined you with 15 points in advance to the truce!
It was to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseilles, that were not well the last season, were "boostés" by this new PSG.
That shows that the League 1 is fascinating.
I hope that in the month of May will be able to have us it to smile while saying us that, despite all difficulties, one finished by to take it.
The PSG seems totally depending on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better than one says than there is a "Zlatan dependance".
That wants to say that Ibrahimovic is very performance and that it puts a lot of goals.
It came for that and it proves that it is the star of the League 1.
It showed wherever it is passed that it was a big player, a world-wide star.
Within the group, one respects the man and the player.
Him also respects the men as it has around him.
Which it did is really exceptional.
That pushes the others to hoist their game level.
Thiago Silva, that is the one of the better defender of the world, allows also to everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
As a disappointment.
I had at heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from glean time of game.
I saw things over there and I took out some reinforced.
Today, I arrive to realize good games in selection.
This I hoped since my baptism with the Blue ones.
One pulled the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and one has oneself today to have an exemplary behavior.
Which look do you concern the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blue ones?
It has the results for him.
One is well placed in the qualifying group for the World-wide one.
The sélectionneur is severe, close of the players, and inspires the wins.
As was it Laurent White.
But I do not want to do comparison.
White had attained his objective while qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will drive the Blue ones to Brazil.
The voucher no (1-1) pulled out, October 16, in Spain does it constitute a founding game?
This game gave us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
The whole opposite of the current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and expenses of treatment between the biases.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, does bank monopolies, drives to the financial crises.
Indeed, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at once a potential change (but convertible in dollars, Euros. ..) and a protocol of reassured exchange to the manner of BitTorrent, that allows the exchange of files of peer to peer.
About 200 000 transactions already were recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on the network.
A small thousand of websites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The course of the bitcoin, after attaining a summit of 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around about ten dollars (the courses are inventoried on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing of very impressive one, compared to the world-wide exchanges in real change or in financial products.
Nevertheless, the European central Bank (CEB) was interested in it in a report on the potential changes published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the potential change having the more of success", "in competition with the dollar or the Euro" and "similar to conventional changes".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself typical others of potential change as the "credits", used to progress in a video game that one wins while playing or that one can buy (and sometimes to exchange in return).
The social network Facebook also developed this system kind.
But, every time, a central authority checks and treats the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the knots of the network are at once agents of the book of accounts, controllers, transmitting of change, and buyers and salesmen.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is done in reality between two electronic addresses to the manner of an e-mail.
Safe that a user can choose a different address for every payment, assuring thus the anonymity.
An information body linked to this transaction electronically is signed by an encoding system to double key.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is so possible to assure itself as the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the book of public accounts, broadcasted in the whole network.
The step key consist in to write this new transaction in this book.
She goes through the mathematical resolution of a challenge launched to the computers, and of which the winning, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a matter of a phase of hachage of file, that is to say of transformation of a big file in a numerical impression shorter and unique.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add him a number before of "to chop" the body.
The goal being to find the number that gives a special impression (a lot of zero at first).
Once this number is find, the other knots verify easily that this is the voucher.
The transaction is located then indestructibly linked to the chain of the body of the other transactions; any modification would change the impression.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay two times with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), a single of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the remaining other orpheline for the two have different impressions.
The computer having resolved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid the inflation, this reward is divided by two uniformly, probably before the at the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the cent millionth, which leaves margin...
The difficulty of the challenge also is raised to every increase of the power of calculation.
The life of the network already had tops and bottoms.
Websites furnishing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The used rift does not concern the protocol itself", assures Rock Noizat, that has just launched Paymium, a payment business in true change using the network Bitcoin.
The CEB does state also of the possibilities of laundering of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash possesses equally this defect.
Actors of weight as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Of others, as the platform of blogs WordPress, the accept.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, Institute Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that close to 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, of the "gigantic balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, that works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins in now.
Rock Noizat, equally author of an educational book on this change, believes a lot to the potential one of this technology as transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in true change) or to a payment by movable without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, that return thus less dear.
The carrier manages of more his identity and can therefore to be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with the merchants, that do not need to install again final or software.
It suffices them to communicate an address that a telephone can "to photograph and recognize", precise Rock Noizat, that assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioned hierarchic systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will be necessary of the time for that Bitcoin imposes, but 2013 could be a turn", it predicts.
The CEB, in his report, foresees besides to revalue the various risks, today considered as students, in case of success of this change.
We left Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army resumes possession of his territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without all to await of us.
It is especially the Afghan peasants who we punished while considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, and the injureds, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed extremist foreigners, of former bosses refugees to the Pakistan, but often of peasants that refuse the presence army foreign, as time of the Soviet ones.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they were rejoined by jihadistes, Pakistani, Arabic, Uzbeks, Tadzhiki.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by the rebel local one, these will not be it more when the Western ones themselves more discreet facts.
The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, that I observed top of the planted hills of almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in the order.
The convoys of trucks and of armored ones rejoined Kabul without being attacked, flown across by helicopters.
There will be not of erupt of the Taliban on Kabul as early as the end of 2014.
The circumstances changed since their irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country to fire and to blood owing to the fights between different factions.
Their taken check of the country then had been perceived as a liberation sort, a return to the security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants surpassed by the organization of Al qaeda, but their position did not improve these days.
Former moudjahidin, Afghan and current government rejoin in the desire on duty the women in an inferior position.
The principal notable one war antisoviétique came back to the strength in 2001.
They transformed themselves in wheeler-dealers, seizing itself governmental earths to sell them in lands to build to the returned refugees of Iran and Pakistan, profitting d" huge American contracts of subcontracting.
They become discredited; the most of them do not have besides fought themselves.
The people, as I heard it in the countries, inhale to a government that is not constituted thieves.
A lot of young want to leave, as will leave those that knew to take advantage of the American largesses: the escape of the capitals is considerable.
The young ones are tired from the war and of its ideologies.
They mixed with the modern world at the time of their exiles in Iran or to the Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages.
About 65% of the population has less than 25 years; Kabul counts now 5 millions of inhabitants, a fifth one of the total population.
In the cities, the governmental schools are full, of girls as of boys.
It will be necessary to furnish work to these young ones that no longer will want to return to the obscurantism of the old ones leave or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the opposing armed, are fond of telephone portable; the television, and its Turkish serials that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities that will order it will they be considered as legitimate?
Of the old ordering one fight antisoviétique already preoccupy to restore provincial militias, that will escape central in power.
The Afghanistan, mountain country, to the strong local identities, should be able benefit from a certain decentralization, to the picture of the western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it in a centralized State, to strong presidential strength, eliminating the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
The president Karzaï does not want any foreign checks, in particular to the occasion of the foreseen elections in April 2014.
But his country is, since the years 50 and already well before, depending on the foreign assistance.
No industry was put back in road, no barrier is in state, no important system of irrigation is repaired.
All is imported; nothing is produced, safe fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental check on infrastructures would have been necessary.
The noise was shed that the Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealths.
That did nothing but to add to the feeling that the Western n" were there that for itself to seize some.
Without energy to treat the iron ore or of copper on the spot, or of means of transportation to export it through the mountains, there is not mining exploitation.
The Chinese already almost left the expression of copper of My Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the immense Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
It will be necessary well a day equally that the Afghanistan and the Pakistan, of which widely depend importations and exportations, reestablish normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops finished themselves November 20.
The new treaty of cooperation foresees the pursuit of the traditional assistance: high school of girls, of boys, department of French to the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, lawful, medical and agricultural domains, support to the archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to attempt "to win the hearts and the spirits" and to realize the impossible task to do to coincide help and offensive actions, a service d"" actions civilo-militaires" ministry of the Defense (Cimic), eliminated in 2012, took, and does to accomplish by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in tens of towns of mountain.
These works, gluttons in hand d" local work, were able to help to contain insurrection: irrigation, well, drinkable water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of the grounds and increase of the cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as to remember, after two billion Euros of military expenditures?
A budget well more modest would contribute to the improvement of the local conditions of life, very hard in these situated valleys often to more than 2 000 meters of altitude.
The embassy received tens of written requests of small agricultural realizations emanating local communities of the province of Kapisa.
For that they liberate themselves conducted insurrection by foreign groups, which the farmers said me to wish, it would be necessary to maintain in their favor a small civil assistance, well checked and that the key directly.
A Constitution to the forceps in Egypt
This is a new blow of poker of the president Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than never around the constitutional declaration, that provisionally grants him the full ones be able, it decided to play his avenue all.
Taking everyone of current, it announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote his final text the next day.
There is all just a week, the boss of the State had granted two additional months to this Assembly to finish its works.
Here soon two years that Egypt leans on a provisional text, several amended times which weakens institutional and drive stability to lawful messes.
This new initiative did nothing but to increase the break in the country.
For its opposing, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing of "to betray his word" and of "to trample the right".
Side of its supporters, one assures that this is a means of some to finish fastest possible with the institutional and political crisis, while accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the fifteen days.
A time period very runs that obliges the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, item by item, to the Egyptiens.
For the President, this is also a manner to rediscover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute done fumes in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptiens favorably will vote, as it asserted it in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Of as much as this recourse to a precipitated vote holds ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Is you vote for my text, is I keep the full ones be able", these in front of supposément to come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange mood that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, to big Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals lacked to the call.
Mi-novembre, little before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, estimating not to have been able be emphasized their views.
The representatives of the human rights, religious minorities or civil corporation had done some even.
So that the necessary quorum is attained, 11 people, members substitutes, were added to the haste, yesterday morning.
Some are very close of the Moslem Brothers.
Without surprise, this is most often unanimously than the items were voted.
Commentators are themselves besides entertained on account of the fact that one of the only divergences of the day expressed itself around... the hour of the prayer, certain members of the committee considering that the clock of the constituent one poorly was regulated.
The text, that was again by train d" to be voted last night, behaves 234 items.
Objects of all the attentions, the item 2 remainder finally the same as the one of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of the charia are the principal source of the right."
The parties salafistes, for that l" establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the Fact that this item was not modified is a pledge of their good will and of their respect of the composed others of the Egyptian corporation.
"Hypocrisy", reply the liberals, that there see only a communication blow.
For according to them, the islamisation of the Constitution is done through other items.
They aim notably the item 220, that confers to the university Al azhar a consultative role, in particular with regards to to verify the accordance of the laws with the charia.
According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing for "the people called has to pronounce itself are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One there can see the beginnings of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are in addition kindled by the Fact that the next superintendent of this university well less should be moderated that the current one.
"At present, there is not concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, one remains in the framework of the civil State.
Most of the lawyers that worked on this text are not oulémas but university, for certain formed in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, that prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition Egyptian.
But it recognizes "that there can be an ambiguity around the item 220, for the employed terms borrow from the religious vocabulary.
One there refers to the "fiqh" notably [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].
And the question can in the future to put itself knowledge in which measure of the civil judges are competent to pronounce itself over".
Beyond his religious aspect, the voted text yesterday is very criticized because of the expanded powers that it grants to the president of the Republic.
The Moslem Brothers argue that these clearly are reduced in comparison of what they were under the former system.
Other not at all disputed: the conferred strengths to the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military officers, the examination of the budget of the Defense will not be subjected to the Parliament, but to a national Counsel of defense.
More not will not be forbidden the processes of civil ones in military courts, as asked it the associations of defense of the human rights.
The latter do also leaves their worries about the text, that they judge liberticide.
Blasphemy offence is maintained and the insult henceforth is prohibited, which could have of engrave consequences on expression liberty, press notably.
Of more, no not done item more echo to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the ban of the torture by the item 36.
The word did not figure in the preceding Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself last night to the television, demonstrations are foreseen this afternoon.
The supports of the boss of the State will march them, Saturday.

"That language has, to Moscow goes" : the migrant ones save money to learn the language
While the representatives and campaigning them of the human rights debate on what will give the law relating to the obligatory linguistic test, swindlers selling of "false" certificates already appeared in the country
Each year, 13 millions of migrant workers come to Moscow, Holy pétersbourg and of other Russian cities.
Most of the time, this are nationals of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their remained families to the house.
Since the 1st December, a law entered in force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to take an exam Russian.
For the moment, this rule concerns only those that have the intention to work in the sector of the services, lodging, services to the special and retail business.
Nevertheless, with the time, promises the federal migratory Service, the tests will become obligatory for all the immigrants.
Of more, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but equally the one of the History of Russia and foundations of right.
It will be necessary to validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian to obtain and to renew his work permit.
Are exempt only the nationals of the countries where the Russian has the official language statute.
The people having obtained from the certificates or diplomas of teaching before the fall of the USSR in 1991 not not one are more concerned by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of the rights
The network of the centers of examination will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language Pouchkine, the University of the friendship of the peoples, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of Holy pétersbourg and of other establishments of higher education of Russia.
The immigrants will be able to pass the examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers already were opened on the whole territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the representatives of the Douma of State and the federal Service of migrations.
But, before the law between in force, defender of them the human rights already have to many returns asked the question in the press: what will that give?
What that the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and the immigrants?
First of all, reply the representatives of the migratory service, that will allow reducing the number of people suffering "esclavagisme to the work".
A lot talk about defense of the rights of the migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the federal Service Russian of the migrations to the Tadjikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized selection will allow resolving to 90% the problems of the foreign workers.
The problems put themselves for the migrant unemployed one, without formation, those that do not know the language and that do not have any medical certificates.
Without the comprehension of the language, certify Sebelev, the migrant future is destined to cross disnonest people that, under the pretence of to help it, will furnish him a "travels" in an overcrowded maisonnette where him and tens of its similar ones will torment themselves during months without food and without paper and will have to slave away between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant ones.
"At their place, one promises them a thing, and when they arrive, one cheats them, one takes their passport, and they do not touch the foreseen salary", confirms the Boss of the Direction of the services of migration for the work of the migratory service of the Tadjikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Do not dispute me, mister the policeman!
Nevertheless, many nationals of the republics of Central Asia that wish to come to earn money in entrusted Russia that they do not know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but as as they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is not of course their fault, but well their misfortune: few Turkmènes, Uzbeks, Tadzhiki can allow themselves to follow this would be only a primary teaching passable.
In fact, their families do not have even any what to nourish their children to say nothing of to dress them correctly and to equip them for the school.
As soon as they arrive to the adolescence, these young ones leave to earn money as soon as the occasion presents itself.
It is difficult when one does not know the language, they entrust.
"You feel diminished and weakened".
Defender of them the human Rights notice nevertheless an important aspect of the law relating to the language.
The examinations will be destined only to the migrant ones that possess a legal statute.
Without statute, there will be not examination or of official work afterward.
Nevertheless, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia in an illegal way.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
A lot of immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official statute in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
Of more, the legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand roubles.
And then, one can obtain a false recording quickly for only 1 500 roubles.
The Russian policemen know that we have false documents, that we do not have any recording, from which the extortion cases.
"They ask us 100, 200 roubles, of what to buy itself the cigarettes, tea", confided in the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, national of the Tadjikistan.
"Does quickly, does not skimp and buy you a beautiful work of art"
As early as the first day of the entry in force of the law relating to the language, one discovered that the papers of recording of the migrant ones were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of examinations of languages already were confiscated by the employees of the federal service of migrations.
The falsified papers go out of a printed copy color ordinary.
Well heard, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant one that hoped thus to facilitate itself the try the examinations had to pay out seven thousand roubles for this document.
This is two times and half dearer than the official procedure: this one will cost to the migrant worker three thousand roubles.
The representatives of the strength and defender of them the human Rights agree to say that the objective in the short one run is to protect the system against the corruption for that it is impossible of simply to buy these "paper bouts".
Authorities can give to the migrant workers that were not able to validate the examination of the first blow the time to follow by the language courses.
Of more, the immigrants that do not know the Russian will see themselves proposed a work in domains that do not imply to communicate actively with the people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take care market of the weapons
The party of the crimes implying legal weapons is very weak
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harden the law in opposition to the carriers of civil weapons.
Such is the reaction of the authorities facing of recent incidents: that it is a matter of the carried out shooting at the time of the marriages or killings organized by the lawyer moscovite Dmitry Vinogradov, that did seven deaths.
The police wants to forbid the harbor of the weapons to bullets in rubber in the public places and raise the legal age of achievement of the permit of harbor of weapon while doing it to pass of 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the boss of the committee of the Douma for the security and the fight against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya that promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced to the Douma of State soon.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that Russian authorities attempt to resolve the problem in "squeezing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net one in which its authors, representatives of various centers of shooting, demand to abandon "this insane hardening".
The crime percentage committed with a recorded weapon is slight, declared to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and specialist of the crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, on a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a weapon to registered fire in the police force while 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded on the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the reinforcement of the laws concerning the civil weapons will not prevent the criminals to supply itself to the black market.
According to them, one can find today to any Moscow arms for a reasonable price.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that it checks the broadcasting of the illegal weapons.
The suppliers: factory to the officer
The black market of the weapons furnishes itself through several canals.
The principal canals are at the number of five, relates Victor Baranets, colonel to the retirement having served ten years to the Ministry of the Education and to the general Neighborhood.
Capture pulled screen of a taking site of the orders of weapons
The first one is "the military track", that is to say the weapons that were flown during the military operations in the Caucase.
"These weapons were flown by the officers Russians, but equally by the Caucasian ones", explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons coming from the black market are the one robbed by the criminals to the forces of the order.
Baranets explains that it is an also several matter stolen weapons in the stocks of the police as the one robbed directly to the representatives of the forces of the order.
The illegal guns leave in sale since the military warehouses.
A lot of the latter often underwent explosions.
"Testified versions indicate that certain fires were released to design to conceal the deficit", explains the former military officer.
For Baranets, the weapon manufacturers there are for something.
"One sees factories of private weapons that do not compete with the competition on the international market and flow the weapons on the black market, notably to Moscow", relates an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important party of guns and of submachines originates poor countries, as the Kirghizie.
"One there finds a local, sometimes hand-crafted production, a mafia formed itself and organizes the supplying", adds the former military officer.
From are which coming the weapons?
The experts evaluated the approximate party of every source of the illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the question was constituted in 2011 by the Center of analysis of the problems and of study for the public administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of the portals relating to the weapons.
The big majority of the illegal weapons, explain the researchers, comes from the army and forces of the order.
The half of the weapons present on the black market itself there met again "by fault of the employees of which the work is linked to the weapons", one explains in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons originate places of military conflicts, 14% are flown at the manufacture and 5% are coming from "clandestine searches".
A salesman and consultant of a gun room having asked to keep the anonymity assures that since well a long time no one buys the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the salesmen will look for the new merchandise in the military warehouses.
The person buys by the intermediary one of a sign a unity, for example a gun TT.
One delivers it for him while passing the merchandise by a grid.
"It transports it in city and sells it for 900€by the unity with two magazines", it relates.
"It is true that the police is during the course of all the matters, thus, when crimes are about to to be elucidated, she carries out a check purchase with the merchants of illegal weapons", adds the salesman.
"As in a luxury shop"
The salesman and the buyer generally are located by the knowledge bias.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type shows itself and proposes me to come to the train station of Begovaya where someone became to take me in a "corner" to bargain over.
The price of the gun, one gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, i must know someone that has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I do not do him confidence.
There are salesmen on the markets, but over there it is necessary to come also while saying for example "from such person, that asked me to transmit that his girl lost a tooth".
Now I buy even a pair of American fists using a person to that I do confidence.
It delivers them for me only to me because it knows that I will not give it.
The small new one look for weapons of different manners.
The former military officer Victor Baranets tried itself as buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the years 1990 when it got ready to publish an item on the subject.
The outlines, according to him, did not change.
One gave him an album photo in which there was "all that one wants".
"I believed myself in a luxury shop", remembers the military officer.
There is not secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, one all can try.
As potential customer, I am not satisfied to buy, one goes with the salesman in forest and one installs a target.
"One leaves me to pull and when I am convinced that the weapon walks well, one begins negotiating", describes the expert.
A shop since his couch
The search engines post the sites and the groups on Vkontakte where one can buy the weapons "for different usages".
For that, one does not need any document and person to meet.
"It suffices to have a money sum specifies", writes one in advertising on the site "To Buy a gun or a fight submachine".
The users there leave their request and ask their questions.
And does one sell to the minors?
"Without permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buys TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The federal Service of security broadcasted an immense network of false sites and collects to the peels the desirous people to buy the weapons of fight.
The people rush on the food as starving wolves and next they meet again to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I heard about this outline type: generally, the site is recorded outside the area of application of the Russian laws.
People take the orders.
The buyer carries out the payment on the automatic boundaries.
"It receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where is hidden the weapon", explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets asserts that while doing a request on the site, one can rediscover oneself without weapon and behind the bars.
The federal Service of security broadcasted an immense network of false sites and collects to the peels the desirous people to buy the weapons of fight.
"The people rush on the food as starving wolves and next they meet again to exploit coal in Siberia", - it asserts.
A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of a weapon to illegal fire, estimate the experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a gun Makarov for 100-300 dollars.
It will be necessary to await about a months and half.
It went out of the long warehouses lasted by the direction of these warehouses of average size.
According to the official data of the ministry, in comparison with the period January October 2011, the number of these crimes has as a whole diminished in Russia of 7% and rises to 22.9 thousand while the proven cases of flight and of extortion of weapons, of munitions, of explosive substances and of bombs lowered of 7.8%.
United States: the employees of the fast-foods and supermarkets are in strike
Close to a quarter of the adolescent Americans go through a work of cashier with McDonald's
The latter days, a protest wave brought up against the low salaries practiced by the supermarkets Walmart and the famous chains of quick restoration such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will take extent or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left associations.
Alongside the increase of the modest salaries that perceive the basic employees with Walmart and in the chains of quick restoration, the organizers of the demonstrations wish to obtain the union creation.
This sector is not for the moment cover by the union movement.
46 hundred per year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "black Friday", the moment an erupting rain of balances seizing themselves millions of inhabitants cut down themselves on America and releasing sometimes of the scenes.
That day, certain employees of the corporation Walmart, that employs in the world 2.2 millions of people, left their post to organize piquets of strike with the unions and the left activists in the stores of the corporation of which the products are intended for the consumers of the modest and average classes.
Walmart markets all: of the put to bed to the shotguns while going through the car batteries, the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and the milk.
The products there are in average 8% to 27% less dear than in the big supermarkets.
This is the reason why a lot of poorly paid employees with Walmart go shopping only on their work place.
The price and the choice of the products did Walmart the one of the groups more powerful to the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart can allow itself to sell its products inexpensive notably because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter complain equally of the difficult work conditions, for example lack of carts élévateurs or of portable scanners.
The participants of the demonstrations of the "black Friday" asked a salary increase, they complained about the Fact that the price of the medical assurance furnished by the business had increased of 30 to 100 dollars by months.
For the basic employee with Walmart that touches 9.5 $ hour, it is a sum that it cannot allow itself.
Scientists of the Californian university of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to 12 $ hour, that would cost to the group 3.2 billion dollars.
This is 1.1% of more of this than it spends currently.
If Walmart transferred all the increase of the salaries on the shoulders of the consumers, every race in the store would come them back to 46 hundred of more.
They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars of more now.
The favoring Walmart notice with satisfaction that protests took place in only nine States and did not carry any harm to the group.
The "black Friday" continued in the stores of 8H evenings to midnight the next day and Walmart sold on this period 5000 items to the second.
Its cash registers carried out in all 100 millions of transactions for the "black Friday".
The Spokesperson of the corporation Dan Fogleman assured in an interview to the left site Huffington Post that in all "less than five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that protest was only an "operation of com 'among so many others "from the organizing union.
"Following customer!"
Protests continued this week to New York and concerned not more the stores Walmart (in this progressive city, they very are not appreciated, this is the reason why they there again are not established) but the McDonald's and other restaurants inexpensive.
McDonald's announces to sell billion portions and after they do not give you even any vacations disease and do not pay you the work that you did fairly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the town Council of New York
Currently, the salary minimum foreseen by the federal legislation and the one of New York is of 7.25 $ hour.
The fast-foods increase them with the time, but of little, in average its basic employees touch on New York 8.90 $ hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum to New York.
It was a time where almost a quarter of the adolescent Americans worked with McDonald's after the high school all in living with their parents.
Few people there saw their principal source of returned ones or wished there to remain for a long time.
Today, I meet again to interview employees of McDonald's that complain about to have to live with this salary and of sometimes to have to nourish their children with.
On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal one finds said commentaries that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know with what you will nourish them.
The showing that launched the movement Thursday to 6h30 close to the McDonald's of the 40E street and on Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast-food are paid to the minimum 15 $ hour, is a multiplication of more than two time than the salary minimum current.
They asked equally to what are created unions in the sector of the quick restoration.
The American law forbids to the administration of there to do obstacle and to punish the protest ones of an union by bullyings or dismissals.
Nevertheless, the administration simplifies them rarely life.
For an union, seize itself quick restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
The one of the principal ones is the extraordinary rotation of the personnel.
They are not agreed
Of other turbulent demonstrations were held close to several of other chains of quick restoration.
The leading moment of protest was the gathering in day environment close to the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several political local democrats, notably the one of Jumaane Williams, member of the town Council, that declared: "McDonald's announces to sell billion portions and after they do not give you even any vacations disease and do not pay you the work that you did fairly!".
The showing were supported by of other visible New York democrats, notably by the candidate to the post of mayor Bill Of Blasio that declared that "we all must support the employees of the quick restoration for that they obtain a just salary and economical well-being that deserves every New York.
The New York Times characterized this demonstration as the most important one than knew the sector of the quick restoration in any sound history.
But only some hundreds of people there participated without counting that all were not employees of fast-food, which these employ tens of thousands of people to New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say if this spark of movement of mass done of the small ones.
"For the moment, one average arrives only to cheat the brain"
Recently, the fans of the new technologies got used to to perceive the increased reality through of the special glasses.
At the start, it is Google that unveiled this summer his current model at the time of his annual lecture and in November one learned that Microsoft had done the request of the patent.
Nevertheless, it spring of the discussion with the director of the group of interactive technologies of 3D laboratory Microsoft of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this corporation, the glasses already are old history.
They are attempted by the perspective to handle potential objects in the air to nude hands, by the potential open space creation.
- You could say us in some words which does your research group?
- We work on the interaction between the man and the machine and we try at the same time to widen the borders of this interaction.
The humanity in his body in remained for the moment to the pixels on flat screen and sometimes to the tactile one.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years in front of ourselves and guess the radical changes that will produce themselves with this interaction.
For example, the console Xbox and the sensors Kinect constitute a step forward, and almost no Xbox does not sell itself today without Kinect for everyone is very interested in the order by the gesture.
- That do we reserve equally the future?
- Although the Kinect returned physical interaction, a lot of things unfold themselves on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information was improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really.
We try to change that and we work on systems of imagery truly 3D working on different technologies, notably the technologies of projection.
It is necessary to let the computer world go out in the ours, in the physical world, to return it more tactile.
For that, nevertheless, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that the surrounds.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by potential objects in a more practical form.
And to begin, we rid of these stupid helmets of potential reality!
- That do you think about the vocal order?
She is appreciated, but not is she overestimated?
One not can say that this be the panacea: the confidentiality question puts itself because one has not always envies to inform the others of its actions or of its intention.
Indeed, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in his niche.
For example, to order the devices in the public places, we had a project for which ourselves pensions to gestures, not wide gestures, but rather to discreet gestures, restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the movie camera of the device, but by a carried bracelet to the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently big, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
Indeed, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- That is to say?
- For example, of which manner would you ask me to pass you this canette?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I speak only.
- Oh, that will be difficult to recognize.
- Therefore, you want to force the users to adapt itself according to which the machine can or not to do to a given moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a matter of a mutual parallel.
I think that very soon we will have to work to elaboration again types of sensors that we will allow more better to identify the reactions of the man.
It can be a matter for example sensors laser, they produce a rather good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If one is very interested in your work on the sensors Xbox Kinect, what that you do not like in the modern movie cameras?
Do they lack resolution, of depth or again of something else?
- As a rule, it is on the current generation that we base ourselves in our work on the recognition 3D.
It would be evidently well to obtain about 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but well the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In comparison with the latter point, all the current technologies are rather good, that adds work to the algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep to the spirit the resolution according to the axes X and THERE, but equally Z.
Speed imports equally a lot, the number of frameworks to the second.
The human movements are rather dynamic, and the 30 c/s not suffisent really, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory of Redmond gave to the key of the sensors an uniform delay of treatment understand between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being more close to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand to which not at all that influences the interaction of the man and machine.
I would have well need of a device of this type in my work, but not necessitating to touch, to have more frameworks to the second.
- But is not it necessary to increase the number of movie cameras?
- The Kinect possesses today three "movie cameras", of which it one is in fact a transmitting infrarouge and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third movie camera is in fact a habitual sensor of the visible field.
She does not serve to define the depth of the object.
A lot of movie cameras could resolve this problem...
Or to worsen it while increasing the volume require calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar supple product to the Kinect, to play with the bend of the movie cameras and to see how that could help to define the locations.
- As much as I remember, Microsoft, to the difference of Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Not do you think that from the standpoint daily usage of the technologies of the increased reality, the glasses are the one of the plateformes presenting the more of perspectives?
- Well heard, take a walk the whole time with a smartphone the raised hands is not practical but here what I think: the better option would be an increased reality "transitional" that would allow you from a plateforme cloud to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and it is that that does their force (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on potential objects in collaboration with of other people.
- Let's Imagine an instant that the manipulation of the objects holographiques potential in the air no longer is accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but equally to the simple mortal one.
There is a problem on which opposing them to this idea point the finger: there is not tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
Which responses your group does prepare in comparison with this challenge?
- In my courses, I say often that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between the man and the machine.
I think that the eighth very well being the addition of the tactile sensations.
For the moment, the one of the interesting techniques is the usage of the second hand to use picture support.
She perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that actually are destined to attribute palpabilité to these "pictures in the air" : for example the interference of several rays ultransonic sounds directed towards a precise point where is located its finger and that gives you the sensation, for the again weak moment, of a breath of air on the bouts of the fingers.
There are equally the bracelets concern the wrists that influential on the nervous endings of the fingers, they are equally an axis of presenting work of the perspectives.
- And you tried to cheat the brain?
Him to do to believe that it feels what it normally should feel the moment it sees something?
- Here a good idea, we did not again try.
There is again a task underneath on which it will be necessary again a long time to give itself evil: the manner to do to believe someone that is located physically in a space very reduces that it walks in a space open almost infinite - we work on the concepts of the rugs of race (nothing to see with those that one finds in the clubs of fitness), movable plateformes and equally gigantic balls.
For the moment, one average arrives only to cheat the brain, it still remains of the numerous years of work.
Here which returns the work on the potential so interesting reality for the researcher: a lot of things are again to the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of the taste and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" follows the project "THE AVANT-GARDE pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to the city-dwellers that are located in advance, in the front keeps culture and art.
This extremist-selective list already welcomed eminent actors of the artistic scene of Holy pétersbourg of which the realizations go beyond the border of the city and that found a recognition in Europe, after knowing in the very Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller.
The very city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all of red clothed one that one can cross close to the Russian Museum, Garden of summer or again in the parties and connected vernissages.
The pictures of Kirill Miller always muster the crowds, whatever their exposition place.
It is the one of the storytellers pétersbourgeois importantly social and philosophical the one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the avant-garde pétersbourgeoise of the end of the years 1980 and beginning of the years 1990.
It is also the symbol of the city, his apparition done to smile the inhabitants and the placement of good mood.
It recently took in its hands an organ of Barbarity and it became the symbol of this instrument to Holy pétersbourg since it had enough ripened for this difficult role of by his existence, his philosophy and his picture of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why you traverse the city all in red and not in yellow or in blue turquoise for example?
- I chose the red one as specialized designer in the aspect and the picture.
In this world, the red one is a compromise between the painter, the creator of picture and the corporation.
Even if in the corporation, all that is not gray gives rise to aggressiveness and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are destined to start the discussion.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be painter?
- TO the exposition of the Palace of the culture Nevskiy where were located my works.
I understood that it was my way.
Then, the wave of the old one non official painters was passed and the new, free ones, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began securing me friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to “Pouchinskaya-10" and then it did not have wave anymore.
I am very interested in the theater, fashionable, to the music, to all the safe kinds to the words.
- And all that met again in your artistic Clinic... - IT WAS important for me to find me to the center of the culture of Holy pétersbourg where must combine themselves the better forces creators.
In 1995, I took take places to Pouchkinskaya-10 that sheltered before the works a musical and artistic club a club Bohemian, the house of bohemia pétersbourgeoise.
A lot there were born: The NAMES, tequila-jazz, I see again Chnour to arrive with the project "THE ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and its friends sang easy songs in play-back in molding shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, today fashionable composer.
When the group began producing itself in live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated not poorly transmissions before the era of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it is while his big career began, but his formation and his basic education, this is at our place that it received them.
Galérie “D137", Club" Griboïedov" : this are repercussions of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees there left as accustomed.
I am a hero of the past century, era where the culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the year", and this is while my reign came to an end.
This is not convenient to work in a new era with of former rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your works characterize themselves by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my pictures are hits, they possess a current event and a very strong acuity.
I will have a programmed exposition "The Russian museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was someone of social one, today that does poorly and that scares to be thus.
But with the clowns, all obliterates itself, the tragic grave.
I like the grotesque one, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea to save the world through the total and disguise obligatory.
Today, it is the dress that imports, one is very interested in the exterior mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe that one cannot give him the hand, but that it is necessary rather to spit him to the tronche.
And the lie will be obliterated by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the player of organ of Barbarity. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who of other that me can play it.
- But can maybe that the commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liquoreux.
A disintegration of the culture is producing itself.
Before, the people were divided in flocks, the favoring bohemia liked a thing, the silly another.
Today, all is divided in microphone communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a ticket of hundred dollars to please everyone.
Today, it is necessary to think about that you will please.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
- It is people who one threw that come to see it, is the sexual and social side walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 thousand not will come and at the end of the account this is less than management, of money, all decays.
I have my fans, the principal this is of not to cheat them, of not to ruin the screw.
When I was young, I painted pictures that a collector hung next to Falk or of Larionov.
I began with the pictures that usually are those that one paints in life end.
Today, one confuses often the ideas.
One says: there is the witty culture, the consumer culture.
The consumption does not have any culture, that has nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew with the example of the painters that lived in poverty and died in poverty and that refused money exactly for the paint.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what that does lack to Holy pétersbourg?
- Of good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But all cannot work in the culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, this was not as that, the tsars understood not well the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
To Moscow, there are today consultant vouchers.
We have people here to Holy pétersbourg that could be experts, but they are separated, for it is necessary of the higher experts that correctly will evaluate these experts and their will clear a way.
Currently, it is the "reigns taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ themselves in this direction that they say fairly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters that must find themselves other museums.
- For you, what that it is Holy pétersbourg?
- Holy pétersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is at Moscow well more of culture, there is a ground for that.
And on our rocks, the art has trouble to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than of readers, it is bad.
In Europe, there is a lot of curious that will see expositions, concerts.
At our place, this layer is very fine.
We must return the fashionable art as it was the case at first of the last century.
Realized project with the support of the stock market of Holy pétersbourg
Deliver in the space
The Earth is in danger.
Climatic warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of spatial shuttles with land on board leave for the research of a planet of relief.
To save humanity, a big question puts itself: how to continue to make our type live in weightlessness or again on a relief planet?
I believe that it there not a lot the choice.
There is in does two true planets that one can conquer, this would be only by hypothesis.
"It is a matter of Venus and of March", estimates Vladimir Mute, researcher of the astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more adapted for life, the temperature to the surface of Venus is of 500.
One there can live only to very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in the space.
One began being very interested in the questions of the reproduction in the space while focusing itself on the flora.
There is again a half century, one carried out experiences on the plants.
Four generations of small cultivated peas on orbit were not different in any manner of the land varieties.
Next, one put on orbit of the insects, small flies fruit flies breeding.
In 1979, eggs of quail were sent in the space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness.
One obtains to the exit a completely normal chick.
It is next that the problems begin.
"The problem is linked to the Fact that the chick must find a support, it must put himself on its paws and begin budging", explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of the biological medical problems of the Academy of the sciences of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
While not finding any support, the chicks shook themselves in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the new born ones saw their instincts completely to atrophy.
The chicks did not react or to the light or to the sound.
Unfortunately, they would die all simply after quattre days.
"We stared wide-eyed them two times, then we abandoned, for this is all simply impossible to work with them over there", explains Vladimir Sychev while noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in the space.
The last one "miniature arch" biological with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiences will continue in the spring 2013.
Nevertheless, the biosatellite "Bion" will embark only types of the same sex.
There was an experience with sharp rats with their fetus in the space.
As a rule, one discovered nothing of supernatural one.
"It was a matter again of the biosatellites and then this is the only experience. It is necessary to carry out this research kind ", points out Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of the space gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, one reaches not again to carry out reproductions directly in the space.
This is not a thin matter.
While losing their habitual environment, the animals no longer are in measure to realize their sexual instinct.
In contrast to the beasts, the man is some capable, as a rule.
The Homo sapiens possesses the abstracted thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional bottom.
This experience type is not realized for ethical reasons.
But the women go in the space since already 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the feminine organism humanity has of more precious one.
Our mouette flew away itself and person on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight in the space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one replied to this question", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired of the sector of the rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in the space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a granddaughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was equally cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being two times on orbit and even working in first rate environment véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, the risk continues.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts that did not have anything and that give birth to a descent in the middle of the health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, that present a danger same during the flights in orbit", concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnologies, the protection against the radiations and the artificial creation of a gravitation.
Laboratory of hydrology of the Center of preparation of the cosmonauts: obligatory step of the preparation for the flight.
Here, in flottabilité no one, the cosmonauts train to the gone out first rate véhiculaires.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for the adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for the nourish, this is their true element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth originates ocean.
In the measure where the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of the stomach of his mother, it is him easier to accustom itself next to water.
This is as a rule logical, for since his birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget", explains the swimming instructor for nourish, Marinated Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child that has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, of a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach, pool atrophy very quickly, the capacity of sprout of the baby loses himself.
Good agreed, let's are unaware of that while leaning us on the delivery fakers.
One of course can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will arrive to do it go out.
"And next?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question.
Of another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
One cannot dress a nourrisson as an adult with a special combination for trainings.
It all simply will be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would envision in this case while imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return on Earth of a handicapped child, completely désadapté", foresees the Director of the committee for the bioethics of the Institute of the biological medical problems of the Academy of the sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
The birth of the children in the space raises again theory.
Nevertheless, with the time that will become reality, when the Land ones will go in their shuttles towards a distant planet that will become the born habitat of their descent in the space.
The boss of the ISC (superior Institution of checks public finances) declared: "The check of the pseudo work independent (in Czech" system Švarc ") failed because of the politicians.
In the domain of the public markets, the Czech Republic has access to competent inspectors and of a legislation of quality but she is at the leads with regards to his application.
This is what declared Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the superior Institution of checks public finances in an interview for.
"The law will never be perfect, but his application must be just and, in my opinion is what is lacking at our place", declared Kala in his commentary of the current position.
A conducted check jointly by Czech and German inspectors suggests equally similar conclusions.
It quotes as example of improper practice approaches it the "system Švarc" by Petr.
Mister the Prime Minister recently declared that the ODS was not going to inconvenience the contractors with checks; is this therefore allowed or forbidden?
"The law must well be applied of a manner or of another, then if she forbids something, even the government leader cannot prevent to act an authority in charge of to be going to inspect to demand the respect of the law", notes Kala.
At the time of the meeting of the commission of check to the Room of the representatives, you evoked a project tchéco-allemand in the framework of which were compared the legislations in the matter of public markets of these two countries.
Of what was it question concretely?
It is a matter of a parallel check that we launched there is of that about two years.
In simple terms, the European legislation foresees which manner to manage the public markets and special national legislations as well as a properly said practice do him continuation.
We mustered all that and although this check procedure again is not finished, very interesting differences we appeared: generally speaking, our legislation is maybe "harsher and of better quality", nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms therefore that it does not suffice to elaborate continually rules more and more detailed but than it is necessary to devote itself to the placement in application same of the right.
In what this project concretely can help you and that in does it result for you?
A common check of this type exactly should contribute to what we stopped striving to specify the laws, to lower and to improve the thresholds, when that does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means to obtain the thing in question to a reasonable price (which wants not always to say the more bottom), in order to exclude any enrichment and an eventual criminal activity.
But while lowering the thresholds of the markets, one will attain not necessarily this objective.
It can himself that this system is located to such not at all submerged by the papers, that those that some look for the find rifts a lot more timeliness than if the threshold had remained higher.
You talk about internal problems concerning the placement in practice of the legislation of the public markets.
How does the check system work in Germany?
Is it existing an analogous institution to our ISC or a method of different organization?
With regards to the institutions, similarly to the ISC, works over there the Bundesrechnungshof that similarly is organized, it disposes equally of a constituted counsel a little differently, but these two institutions proceed basically in an analogous way.
Competences are equally, in a certain measure, similar, with a nuance nevertheless in comparison with our system: Germany being a federal structure, she disposes therefore also of course of the accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH only can check federal money, which corresponds at our place to the resources of the State.
The public managed funds at our place by the regions and the municipalities, over there are checked at the level of the courses of the accounts of the Länder.
In the matter of the national legislation, is she simpler than the ours?
I would not want to do general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in certain domains, Germany often is designated as a model but one surely cannot say that she does better in all the domains.
This is can be had to the Fact that they have better inspectors?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not dispose any data of comparison.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to say as as this country as we consider as a model is equally confronted to all a series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
In the matter of the national legislation, that meant for you, as institution, the amendment of the law on the public markets, do its effects themselves already to feel?
This amendment having entered in force comparatively recently, it has not again impact on our check operations.
As do us the checks has posteriori, it is necessary to reckon with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparation of the futures check - we launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of bad management" with which happened to the screen close to 14 000 public markets - there these changes will be done well heard to feel, because the thresholds were modified as well as the conditions of certain types of procedures of calls of offers and thus of Continuation.
Is what therefore you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as a load addition for the administration?
I think that this law constitutes a step in the good direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become harsher and than it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the system of the preceding regulation, the contractor (for example the regional counsel, in the case of the regional operational programs) constrained the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach to the budget discipline.
Is it therefore really useful to return the harsher law of this manner?
No, no this manner, I think.
The system must exclude those that want to attack the system or about it to abuse but not to punish those that commit definite errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put advantage of pressure on the administration.
Which is therefore the solution for itself go out some?
Let's look at towards where we do not go.
Recently, the Prime Minister declared that the ODS was not going to inconvenience the contractors with checks of the so-called system Švarc - what does that mean?
Is the system Švarc prohibited or authorized?
The law must well be applied of a manner or of another, then if she forbids something, even the government leader cannot prevent to act an authority in charge of to be going to inspect and to demand the respect of the law.
It can declare: "We will change the law and to authorize it", but it can say only we will act as if of nothing was.
The law on the markets consisting of of the comparatively strict rules on the formalities to accomplish and this, exactly in order to protect the offer call.
But it is besides tragic that a soumissionnaire is eliminated only for cause of definite defects.
The law never will be perfect, but his application must be just and this is, in my opinion, which is lacking at our place.
The roads are by frozen places, but the most remain feasible.
To certain places of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and equally snowy.
The network remains nevertheless in major feasible party, to certain places with an increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were this feasible mornings, but by frozen and equally snowy places.
The temperatures fell and oscillate between -{PN5° PN} and -{PN10° PN} C but they lightly should climb back up in the day.
The snow falls stopped in the region and it remains in the plains only an end lying of snow.
The crests of the Mounts métallifères (Krušné hory) nevertheless are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
It spring of the data of the regional service of discussion of the roads that because of fog, visibility was by reduced places.
The quick way R6 and the national roads of the region are henceforth feasible without difficulties.
Vigilance remains nevertheless to placement, for example on certain bridges of which the surface can be frozen and slick.
All the regional roads and the ways of third category, including the mountain roads, are equally feasible.
It still remains on certain of their sections of the remainders of frozen snow and by places compacted by the traffic.
Especially in the situated zones in altitude, the drivers must reinforce their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and of Hradec Králové
The Direction of the roads and expressways signals on his website that certain roads of Bohemia of the East are threatened by the formation of verglas and that of the put to bed snow compacted by the traffic can find themselves on the roads in the mountainous zones and situated in altitude.
The services of discussion of the roads warn the drivers against the risks of formation of verglas in the zones of the region of situated Pardubice in altitude.
There can be verglas in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, principally on the regional roads and of third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 to the surroundings of Svitavy chemically were treated.
The snow is located principally in the Mounts of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mounts of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad and of Trutnov, a snow layer compacted by the traffic is present on the roads in the situated zones in altitude.
In Bohemia of the East, the time will be today dry, most often released, with of eventual cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and the temperatures generally will oscillate between -{PN3° PN} and + 1° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads of the region of Pilsen are today feasible, although, by places, it agrees to do proof of an increased vigilance and to adapt his driving to the meteorological conditions.
It freezes this morning, the temperatures oscillate between -{PN3° PN} and -{PN9° PN} C.
After the last falls of snow and the cooling that followed, certain ways of communication can be by frozen places.
The drivers can expect to cross zones of fog, visibility will improve nevertheless progressively.
This it spring of the news of the regional service of discussion of the roads.
The expressway D5 is feasible almost without difficulties, the services of discussion of the road communications recommends nevertheless an increased vigilance between the kilometers 80 and 131.
The national surface of most of the roads is dry and frozen.
Certain sections can be frozen in the district of pilsen-sud and in the district of Tachov.
The regional ways and of third category are humid and in this case applies the warn against the frozen sections.
The drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on the less frequented roads of the region of the Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
The drivers going in the zones of the region of situated Olomouc in altitude today must reckon with a snow thick and soft layer the roads.
This layer remained on the collar says sedlo" and on the road heading for Videlský after the operations of chemical treatment.
The snow falls constrained this night the personnel of discussion of the roads to go in the field; according to the services in charge of the garbage collection, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In the somewhere else region, most of the roadways are feasible without difficulties.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk are located of the remainders of snow.
The drivers circulating heading for Jeseník must expect to meet the collar says sedlo" a snow thick and soft layer declared today to the boss of the services of discussion of the roads of the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues of the district of Jeseník equally returned on the spot during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical carried out treatment, the roads, now are released and wet, even in the zones the more students.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are feasible without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk the drivers nevertheless should watch out in the sections in forest zones to the humid remained roadways.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and of Liberec
As early as this morning, the services of discussion of the roads of Bohemia of the North signaled several difficult sections.
It spring of the data of the police, that what's more of certain covered places of snows or of verglas, the road of going mountain of Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain underneath zero what's more low altitude, and therefore the snow and the verglas should maintain themselves on the roads. In the plains, notably to the south is central Plateau of Bohemia, it does not have, on the contrary, no problem and the roads generally are dry.
No circulation difficulty was signaled for the moment.
The services of discussion of the roads signaled the presence of verglas, notably to the surroundings of.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal to his formation: rain and melted of snows during the day, released sky and freeze during the night.
One signals equally, since the principal axes of circulation, difficult conditions on the national road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and of Liberec.
The closing of the circulation between Telnice and Knínice is had to branches of trees that bent themselves under the weight of the snow until to attain the roadway.
Šimon Ornest declared: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think about the Fact that in less than a months this should be the end of the world?
It is only one of these new alarming one, the trap kind in which these like us to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, one in groove rather and one is said that we are the only group able to collect a remainder of positive energy in order to push back or to prevent the end of the world.
Of more, you climb in December a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present more in detail this project to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we prepare since already two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11 o'clock 10 in the morning.
The day before, December 20, three concerts will unfold themselves simultaneously, to Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish practically the moment come to an end the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati that is located in the Pacific Ocean, on a spindle schedule 12 hours ahead in comparison with us.
Who did have this idea?
At the start I think that it was my idea, next we all conceived with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Outside of the Fact that we want to collect sufficiently positive energy to save the world, we want also together, with the public, reflect to the state of the world that we leave to our children.
To the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, notably shoes, T shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, while buying them online on www.e-tap.cz the people equally we can support.
The group The Tap Tap with of others interpret equally recorded a hymn against the end of the world that entitles itself "Fine of the canceled world" (in Czech "Konec zrušeno").
Is she already very popular on YouTube, l'entendra-t-on also at the time of these charitable concerts?
Of course, all to the end, at last, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not have place...
She will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
The hymns will rejoin also to a given moment in the live, completely unique framework of a transmission, Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák that holds equally the principal role of Jesus in the pop video, Xindl X there sings also...
How are you come some to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with of other personalities of the Czech show-biz, in reason on account of the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to do them to participate intensively to these projects.
It proved himself that the most of them are interested by such a cooperation and that that entertains them.
Will to what serve the profits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the center of formation Studeo that is accessible to the people to reduced mobility and of which work us to the realization in the framework of the institute with the association Tap, and that for six years.
Of the teaching go uniformly with the students of the institute and propose them activities that the interest and the entertain.
The students do not have themselves the means to go to current, we try to help them of this manner.
In the framework of the achievement of the construction of the institute will transfer us this project in a new independent building.
Several groups of music and interpret climb on scene at the time of each of these concerts?
According to which criteria, did you choose them?
We tried to elaborate a program that addresses to itself all the generations, including the children.
For example, to Prague, climb on scene Chinaski, Lesbian Supports, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you prepare also to others "méga events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the spring of Prague; there also, we will prepare surely a program of quality with interesting guests.
We would like also to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, once on the spot to the United States, I very much would like to combine concerts to Washington and to Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you played for example to Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a composed group of handicapped people.
How do you manage the organization and the logistical one of your turns?
It is not so terrible that that seems initially.
We have five members in electric armchair of which the vehicles must travel in hold, naturally we drag around also a lot of luggage and of cans d'instruments...
So far all is itself more or less always well passed, and British Airways always perfectly were prepared for us, they astonished me more of once.
Even to Moscow, from which we returned recently, all happened without problems.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare in what these countries differ with regards to the access opportunities for the people to reduced mobility, attitude of the public opinion lives to screw of the handicapped people and so on.
Which were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and of other places where all works better than at our place, we exactly were witnesses to Moscow that to the east all is still just in an initial phase.
In comparison with Prague, Moscow is again very not very accessible to the handicapped people; over there, it is not again current that a person moves herself only in electric armchair in the center of the city.
They consider not again as an evidence to give the priority to a person in armchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, over there also, an association striving to attract the attention on the problems of the handicapped people is being created.
Must in what we again recover the more developed country?
There are a lot of things for which ones we are again late...
It is important to mention that the improvements and improving always depend of the efforts deployed by the concerned people.
To London and Madrid, it is completely current that the people with a heavy handicap move themselves only in the public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is nonetheless not very frequent over there that a big number of handicapped people participate actively to social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary to the point of the progress!
The respect of the public and the access opportunities are a thing, but the position will begin really to change when we will have among ourselves of the sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the moment, it is only isolated cases of people that have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's return behind of some years, what did you push in 1998 to create this group?
I began working as educator to the institute where I found myself surround by a lot of ready young to invest itself in something.
And as I am musician myself (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we created an activity music.
And then, with the time, as says our moderating one one a little lost the check of the position (laugh).
The success arrived only during the latter years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, the fact to create links with known singers and to work actively to the promotion of the group helped us.
We understood that, if a work not is visible, this is as if it not existed in the bottom.
Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, what's more, we to allow having professors of quality, equipments, and so on.
Did you have for objective to attain such a level with The Tap Tap?
As early as the beginning, I felt that there was a potential one to change the things.
The show business is full of things that copy themselves one another.
In a way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with prudence and that lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare to assert that Tap Tap is the one of them.
The first impression of a person that sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural...
But pity is totally useless, because the people with a handicap are not suffering beings, abandoned of all, that we must take in pity.
It is people that can live a life to entire party and to blossom, to condition of some to have the necessary means of course.
I say often that when people with a handicap arrive to realize something, this is not only an advance for them but for the whole corporation.
Your success equally is not had to the Fact that you are an exacting leader, as qualified you by a lot of people?
If we want to do the work of quality, we must be intransigent in a lot of domains and demand a certain discipline.
But I think that this is completely normal.
Certain people arrive at our place with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they go counts that they must come to the repetitions two times a week, follow the preparatory courses and pass a lot of times on the roads for the concerts, they lose quickly their enthusiasm.
But that works same manner in every group that wants to work and attain objectives.
The group The Tap Tap counts currently twenty members.
Were how much d 'between them already there in 1998?
A single one,.
We are a group open, the people enter and leave, one do not can anything.
Our doors always are opened to those that want or would want to rejoin us.
That will be the case the day before of the foreseen day of the end of the world, on Thursdays December 20 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will unfold itself to Prague in the arena Incheba, to Brno to Fléda and to Ostrava to the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and of musical others of Czech Republic.
In evening end, these three cities will be connected by broadcasting relay when will be sung jointly the song of the group The Tap Tap "Fine of the canceled world".
The goal of the concert is to muster financial means (to height of 25 million CZK) to equip the center of formation multifonctionnelle Studeo that is located to Prague in the institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is of 400 CZK, the entry is free for the children until 12 years, the prévente of the bills is opened to Bohemiaticket.
The Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the time of the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European spatial Agency, the Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, she is the second State member of the former pad of the East (the Czech Republic became member to entire party November 12 2008).
The Poland had started a narrow collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and during the years that followed participated in a number of projects of the agency.
The road of the Poland towards the space nevertheless began a lot earlier.
Already before the second World War, fascinated Polish worked on spatial flights; they met not always comprehension.
I would want to evoke for example the lecture of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, December 6 1933, during which it presented pulled ideas of his work before keeps entitled "Introduction to astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld remembered than alone the doctor Jan Gadomski was very interested in its works.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work "Introduction to astronautics".
The aforementioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became afterward a big proponent of the astronomy and astronautics.
It published hundreds of items in the Polish newspapers and wrote many works devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a proponent of the astronautics of world-wide fame, his contribution notably was rewarded by the Fact that his name was given to the one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925 was constructed in Poland a destined track inspection car to be equipped of a burst out motor.
One does not know unfortunately or the author or the details of this project.
It is not not clear more if the rocket had to serve to propel or to brake the track inspection car.
The only known information on this track inspection car are the one of the press of the era.
From 1933, the Polish artillary began devoting itself to the rockets.
The research were taken by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It spring of the preserved documents that this research had attained the stadium of the essays.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research break off.
In 1937, the plans of a rocket of hunt photoélectrique, drawn by the engineer appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of a person known as author leliwy-krzywoblocki.
These two projects had for end a military usage of the motors of rockets.
Just before the war, all the projects of usage of the technique of the rockets were taken by the scientific provisional consultative committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy"), that coordinated all the works.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of functioning, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, of other works devoted to the aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the corporation astronautics Polish (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a corporation in the number of November 1954 of the newspaper Problem, in which are located four more detailed items devoted to the aeronautics.
In the one of these items, writes by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a corporation devoted to astronautics
To this era, projects of artificial satellites already had been launched and it was clear that the domain of the spatial research had future.
At first year 1956, the corporation astronautics Polish (PTA) deployed efforts to enter into the federation astronautics international (created in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became an uniform member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the federation astronautics international.
It preserved his function until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the crowned development of success of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), that became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was finished in 1957 and the first launch took place October 10 1958.
This rocket of a reach of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Afterward was constructed an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer 1959, essays of flight of the rocket to two floors RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific works - the rocket RM-34 should have had a going reach until 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all the works of development were stopped.
The rocket Meteor-1 perfect during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of type RM.
This rocket, conceived with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the reserved space to the scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had access to a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was of 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum reach of all these types of vehicle was of 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the rockets Meteor-2 were perfected in the aeronautical institute, the first essays of flight began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to an about altitude 60 km.
Afterward were constructed the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It suits again to mention the entry of the Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the program Interkosmos, the Poland equally participated in the spatial exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the law on the works of public usefulness is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional Course repealed the law on the works of public usefulness.
This decision raised in the public opinion a lively discussion.
It is without any interesting doubt to examine this problematic one of a point of wider view.
The economical systems oriented towards liberalism, so in THE E.U. that in the context of the globalization, are based on the principle of more of economical not regulated competition.
This concretely means that the different economical entities as well as the national economical systems constantly are in conflict with one another.
This results from the principle of the liberty of the commerce and free circulation (without limits) private capital allied to a frantic financial speculation.
The considerable differences of the price of the work (salaries) generate a tension on the prices.
It suits to put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives by the importation of sold goods down with take to withstand the economical competition in "returning dearer" the price of the competitor, with the intention of to remove a bigger one leaves the market and to increase thus its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most of the contractors: is to transfer the production abroad, is to buy cheap, is to disappear. The result is an important unemployment in the countries where the prices of the work students in comparison to other economies.
Being given that the private capital has no responsibility from the standpoint social and by there even of responsibility lives to screw of the unemployment that it generates, the social loads of the State increase necessarily.
All this position intensifies the perfect bad grace of sirs the contractors to pay taxes and to compensate thus the economical damages and social caused to the body of the corporation by this race to the profit.
This position is at a such no public notoriety that it is not necessary to furnish data statistics concrete.
The practices without scruples of the private capital generate in the different economies a position in which the governments of the different countries are constrained to launch itself in a competition mutual insurance company in order to lower artificially the social level of their own population with the intention of to attract at their place the foreign capital.
Otherwise says, the governments put their own population to the thank you for the private capital without taking account of the social collapse.
This shows itself principally in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to constrain economically his own population to accept the diktat of the prices of the private capital, notably in the domain of the salaries.
This produces itself on one hand by a system of economical constraints in case of unemployment in the long term and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of the employees in the domain of the legislation of the work.
It in results a growing poverty and the development of the differences between the rich and the poor ones.
In RFA, it exists since years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor ones that cannot provide for their needs with their own work.
One already counts by million the number of these people.
In the framework of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes completely current that the employees receive of such salaries that the State sees itself constrained to pay a supplement for that they attain the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has for example summer updated in the case of the employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The measures of economy of practically all the States members of the south of THE E.U. generate, without any doubts, an analogous position in which, under the disastrous pressure of a collapse of the corporation, the people are constrained is to emigrate (as it was the case to the XIXe century), is to struggle with salaries of misery, outside the corporation, in the hope that a day the private capital invests in their country.
It is necessary here to ask itself the following question: from which will come this capital?
If it originates other countries of THE E.U., then past poverty from one country to another; this capital cannot come not more, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of an European salary.
This concerns also any Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media assert, to itself to weary some, that the State cannot do the investments in capitals in his own economy, that the directed economy drives to an economical catastrophe.
The private capital defends bitterly the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulating interventions.
It is necessary then to wonder if the private capital does not influence and, even, directs not today, according to its own selfish interests, the political one and by the same, the State completely.
The response to this question is without any doubts yes.
The proof is some that it exists a practically omnipotent and present lobby all the States.
It in results a hopeless position showing itself in the domain of the corruption, by the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where all is reprehensible but not punishable.
In RFA, the position is such, that because of the lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate the elaboration of the projects of laws to offices of lawyers narrowly linked to the industry.
These law projects next are adopted to the Bundestag.
The entirety of the strength does not come from the people, as the informers the constitutions of western type, but of powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is shows that the oriented democracies towards liberalism see themselves now quickly confronted to the position described by Appianos in his entitled work "the crisis of l 'Roman empire to the time of Caesar and of Pump ": "L 'State was since a long time in the middle of the deliquescence and the functions were attributed by the violence.
The jar blows-of-wine, the obtained favors illegally, and the rocks and the swords were equally used to obtain these posts.
The under-of-table and the corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold voices"... ... "The honest people did not try not in the least obtain themselves functions, it resulted some once the State remained 8 months without consuls".... 'One began really to say that the remedy to this difficult position was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man "... It is true that Appianos had at the Pumped spirit, but it is Caesar who irreversible transformed the democracy in system absolutist.
In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the current corporation is based on the preference of the personal profit, without consideration for the interest of the corporation in his body.
In his gasoline, the private capital no longer is able to understand and to emphasize the interests of the corporation in his body.
It in results, today as formerly, a decadence without preceding of the elite, without any effort to carry out reformations in depth.
We have therefore to look for the causes of the emergence of the Fascist and Communist systems in the liberalization without scruples of the economical systems of the XIXe and XXe centuries.
In the current state of the things, one can consider the disappearance of these systems to the profit of the democracies of liberal type as a pause sort before a new step.
The Fact that the current elite are unaware of completely the eventuality of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are today the witnesses as well as the crimes against humanity such as we know them of by the old and history recent.
The repeal of the law on the works of public usefulness is not a solution, less in the long term.
Under the pressure of the economical competition, so to the international plan that at the internal level European, the government of the Czech Republic will be constrained to continue to look for means to diminish the social level of the population.
This tendency is in fact systemic.
The solution consists in reformations to sociopolitical aimed, that will reinforce the investments in capitals of the State in the economy, will increase the influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of monopoly of the private capital in the corporation to the profit of the State.
Israel: laboratory of the chaos.
"Nothing go out never of the violence and will never be able" declares Sting in the Fragile entitled song of which the towards principal of the refrain is "let's forget not how much we are fragile".
"If my sons did not want any wars, it not there in would have", asserted Gutele Schnaper, the woman of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the band of Gassed, as usual, many reactions rose.
Some take the party of Israel, deducing of his right to the autodéfense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, of others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the committed genocide against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the knowledge question that is guilty and that is victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; when all is said and done, the living current ones of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the presents political position and did not live the beginning of the violence.
I would want to offer to the readers a point of situated view "behind the curtain", on the one to that takes advantage principally of the tensions that continue already since more than 95 years (to count declaration Balfour in 1917) in a small end of country of the Middle East.
Certain of these reflections lean on available historic facts to the study, of others go out again of my own comprehension of the one, or exactly group of individuals, that is the principal instigator of the events of the modern history.
The history of humanity is before all the history of a fight for the strength.
To every era, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoléon.
What is not so evident is knowledge if these individualities were a question of independent manner or if they had their acts to the holds court to someone that directed their acts according to objectives previously define.
We must admit that we live to an era where world-wide wealth is concentrated between the hands of some individuals and that this generating financial concentration some be able was not able to be done during the course of a single generation.
Among the families possessing an astronomical wealth distinguishes itself particularly the family Rothschild, that could be considered as the head of the pieuvre (I am unaware of if these families have again a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written to their subject.
Well heard.
As early as the years 90 of the XIXe century, they obtained the first agency of world-wide press (Reuters) in order to put an end to the link establishment between their name and of engrave acts criminal to which ones they were mixed and that always had meant for them a reinforcement of their Power, a growth of their fortune or the two.
They possess major participations in almost most of the central banks of the world and prepare or take wars against the countries in which these they have not again of the such participations (before the invasion of the Afghanistan the number of these countries were of 7, after the invasion of the Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Kadhafi only of 4, meanwhile Russia placed the central bank Russian under the check of the Russian government).
Any person that tried to erect itself against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschild the statute of central bank and began emitting during the civil war his own money (governmental, I hear well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began emitting money own and wanted to dissolve the FED, it was murdered in 1963, the representative Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while it wanted to file a process against the FED to have released the big economical crisis of 1929.
Their strength thirst at the world-wide level drove in the years 1859 to 1871 to the wording of a plan of three World War by Albert Pike, an initiated freemason to the 33E degree, being the the highest level.
The first war had for objective to eliminate the big monarchies étatiques of Europe, the second had to eliminate the colonialisme, notably British, and the third one should reduce the world-wide population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the oecuménisme being nothing other that the such a solution bait) and, to the final one, obtain an absolute strength.
The method used by the clan of the families more rich with to their head the Rothschild consist in to create a crisis then to propose next a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and always drive to a worsening of the position (to see the creation of the destined FED to avoid that do not repeat themselves crises as the one that they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding releasing the first World War by the assassination to Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the holds court austro-hongrois, they destroyed Russia tsariste while provoking the revolution bolchevique.
The first World War finished abruptly by a German capitulation without economical justifications and military officer (the war was no longer necessary at the destruction of Russia tsariste) and she was followed by the morcellement of Austria Hungary, the of Europe central power.
For an easier triggering of the second World War, the bankers left the politicians to create a position of latent conflict: they have, on one hand, imposed on the Germany of faramineuses repairs of generating war thus the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it suffices them next to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing finger of the guilty ones, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a composed Czechoslovakia of Different nationalities, including of a strong German minority that had to play the role (that she rings effectively) of fifth column to set fire to the powders and to release a war.
At the end of the XIXe century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the movement Zionist, of which it one of the branches inhaled to the Jewish creation of a State, preferably in the region of the historic Judée with Jerusalem as capital (return to Sion).
The declaration of mentioned Balfour above put the massive bases of an emigration of Jews towards the Palestine and the first frictions with the Arabic local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed party and of other.
The second World War burst; it is difficult to appreciate if Hitler broke the chains in which ones the international bankers had held it initially; or if all that it did was planned, the fact is nevertheless that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a State Jewish by the world-wide community.
Israel officially was been founded in 1948; same manner that the war repairs impose on Germany were at the origin of the second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fire home being able to provoke a third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in release this war, the Jewish population will be as her was it during the second World War, the first victim of the fight, this time just like the Arabic or generally Moslem population the Average East.
Israel is as an immense laboratory, the source of discord and of chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it suffices to see how the people divide themselves bitterly between supporters and defender of Israel).
Who is guilty and that is victim in the Israeli conflict Palestinian, where a wrong generates another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where one finds, to the origin of all, the cupidity of certain individuals and their desire to obtain the strength on the entire world?
It is necessary here to do the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as at our place, the international bankers propose to the people to the elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascistic politician, loyal screw to screw of the international bankers, that does all in order to release a war with the Iran, that can, because of the adhesion of this country to the organization of cooperation of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc. ..) to spread itself to become a world-wide conflict and, being given that the Iran checks the straits of Ormuz by which passes through 20% of the whole oil World-wide (this naval corridor has a width only of 2 miles) and generate a destruction of the world-wide economy.
Under which light appear now the comments held by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing of which we need is a general crisis and the people will accept a new world-wide order."
In their idea, the new world-wide order is a world of masters and of slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of the finance is served by the remainder of the human population.
A world in which all new born one see itself established to the birth a microchip done of him a totally to be checked.
"That they constrain all the individuals, small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves to concern the hand or the forehead a brand to red iron, so that it or cannot buy or to sell the one that carries the ferocious name of this beast or the figure of his name.
It is necessary to understand: that the one that has common sense counts the ferocious figures of this beast.
This number designates the man and this is six hundred sixty six."
The film Argo: when all goes to the more evil, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of composed show of Islamist students took assault the American embassy of Teheran and kept in hostages 52 diplomats.
They had to be liberated in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, that supported his system since several decades.
The position did not offer to the American administration of positive exit, she did not can, in fact, abandon the Shah, because she gravely would have shaken the confidence of its allies in of other countries.
Nevertheless, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the theocratic establishment of a system, she was not in a position to obtain the liberation of the hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, again worsened blow later by the fiasco of the attempt of liberation of the hostages by the force.
The confined diplomats finally were liberated 444 days later, after the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their goes out gave rise to to the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Crankcase facing Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980.
The film Argo, actor and metteur in scene Well Affleck, describes an episode of this history that offers a small victory to America.
Just before that she is not occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After the complicated péripéties, they met again in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in let them Iran go out of thanks to an incredible cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team of come shooting to do the locations for the shooting of a film to big spectacle of science fiction.
Combination of the kinds
The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez requit the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to return the more credible legend, of the go shopping specialized mentioned this film project, press conferences were organized and a corporation of fictitious production had real offices.
The details of the operation remained a long time secret, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of Affleck is an unusual combination of several kinds.
It is a matter on one hand of a political conceived thriller in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the successful narrative of a blow, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The moods succeed themselves: sequences of Teheran of style documentary (in the subtitled sequences are presented photographs iconiques of the era of the events and the manner in which, thanks to these photos, these same positions were retranscribed in the film, there is not big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes of the general neighborhood of the CIA and of other institutions with dressed up men discussing the position around lecture tables, in the corridors and to the telephone...
Well Affleck succeeded getting going again his career in a remarkable way.
Of ridiculed actor, it became a metteur in respected scene and his game of actor stopped giving rise to ironic remarks.
Argo is his long third measurement after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is equally the first film of Affleck that does not unfold itself in his origin city, Boston.
The direction of the atmosphere of a place constitutes the one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the standard Hollywood one.
Affleck done equally proof of this direction of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran "is held" by Canada.
The better scenes of the film unfold themselves in streets, at the time of the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by his clarity that suggests equally the confusion and arising unpredictability when sudden, in a given place, writes itself a history page.
Affleck and its assistants obtain an analogous effect in the fictitious scenes (the false team of shooting in the bazaar of Teheran).
Too many actions to too many places
The metteur in scene had to satisfy itself of an offering subject in fact only few twitching scenes, to the film direction of the term.
It goes out some himself strong well, it adds sometimes certain elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which threatens it crisis to the airport of Teheran is separated by a telephone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track are enough pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in his dissipated character, had to the necessity to show too many events to different too many places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are completely charming in their role of Hollywood collaborators, their personages would have deserved a bigger place and this are not, far of there, the only ones in this case.
The film of Affleck lacks a little dramatic tension, it leaves himself to see with a moderate interest, while appreciating the realization and the style nostalgic style of the years 70.
It induces the spectator, but with difficulty.
As reminder of a history again, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the matter.
Rules to inflate balls, the bananas and the circus
The waiter www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that takes each year a public investigation on the bank expenses the most absurd ones, decided, at present, to launch the competition of the regulation or ideas in origin of "the workshop E.U." the most absurd ones.
"The Fact that THE E.U. envisions, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the direction of the big European businesses was at the origin of our decision", declared for the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among mentioned absurdities, there already is, for example, the recent decision of the European Course to unify the insurance premiums for the men and the women.
So far nevertheless, the women were favored with regards to the tariffs of the assurances on life because they represent, objectively, a least risk for the insurance companies.
The people can signal until the end year any other idea so unbelievable of "the workshop of THE E.U.".
"The vote will take place before the end of the months of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of THE E.U. is located, for example, the obligation to add of the composing bio to the fuels, what has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban to use the reliable thermometers to mercury, only because they contain a comparatively weak quantity of a dangerous substance or again the directive concerning the size of the cages of the hens which induced the increase of the price of the eggs.
Critics were equally emitted by the passed in opposition to the ban of fact to use the expression "butter to spread" or collection of the sale of the classical bulbs.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration reacts often under the commercial or industrial pressure of a lobby the ask habitually are defended to Brussels by a State or a group of States (thus the Czech Republic imposes currently the ask of its banks while threatening to use his veto power).
The interests of the groups of pressure are equally, for example, to the origin on account of the fact that in the Union, the bananas must not be of an inferior size to 14 cm or to present an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself while arguing that she did nothing but to harmonize the not homogenous national norms that complicated the commerce.
The norms concerning the fruit and vegetables were softened despite the opposition of certain States, claiming that the existing directives induce a waste of food commodities.
The first price will be can be awarded in this investigation to the regulation of THE E.U. of last year according to which must figure on the inflatable balls an indicating warning that the children of less than 8 years must not inflate without supervision of adults.
THE E.U. referred to an American investigation according to which the balls are, among the toys, the first cause of death of children by smothering.
A similar restriction applies to the children of less than 14 years with regards to to blow in trumpets of fails.
At our place also, one has strange ideas.
The following rule concerning the European officials is themselves rather absurd: because of the sensitiveness of this theme for Greece, any person having an official function within THE E.U. can use the name "Macedonia" and has, to the place, to talk about FYROM (Form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Leave To Do" grouping together of the liberal economists, the waiter Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this investigation, besides certain mentioned absurdities above, the regulation of the Union concerning the volume of the reserves of food products on the Czech Republic territory.
THE E.U. had set up maximum volumes for the reserves of food products being able to find themselves on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our adhesion to THE E.U.
The Czech Republic surpassed next, for example, the fixed volumes for the mushrooms in preserve and risked, therefore, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation judged interesting the idea to pour sums of money to certain countries because they do not have any access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy to ask subsidy granting.
These ideas are not nevertheless native Brussels but of Prague.
"The not fact to have sea handicaps us.
We will ask the European Union a reimbursement". Thus expressed itself, to the fall 2004, the minister of the Farming of the era Jaroslav Palas.
It deduced that, owing to our wheat production, and after the said purchases "interventionist", the State had met again with full stocks that it next had to export.
According to Palas, THE E.U. should have poured us million Euros, because the Czech Republic is located far of the harbors.
In the last analysis, the European Commission positively replied to the Czech request and organized an offer call for the wheat purchase in origin of the countries without maritime access.
The subsidies for the subsidy achievement were proposed to the towns by the ministry of the local Development directed by the minister Pavel (us-deu), these had, concretely, serve to compose of the ask subsidies granted by Brussels.
THE E.U. declares: "The strange regulations are rare".
If the regulations give rise to often critics in the States members, according to many experts, the efforts deployed by the HAD regarding regulation and of improvement of the effectivité of the functioning of the Union as well as in the general domain of his development, deserve rather of the praises.
Do more engrave is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the usage of subsidies of THE E.U. for projects that do not have absolutely anything to see with the reinforcement of the European integration, but that were imposed by the States members at the time of the budget negotiations.
The Fact that the Czech Republic has, as of other countries of the Union, beat itself to Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (fights of which she goes out not always conqueror) gives rise to lively emotions with the Czech ones.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czech ones defended with success name "Olomoucké, for what of name "Tuzemský rum" that climbs back up at our place to the XIXe century, our producers had to replace it by name "Tuzemák".
Only the products to basis of alcohol of sugar of cane, and not to basis of sugar of beet, can carry the name of rhum.
In the official list of the recorded products of THE E.U., one finds today in company of universally known cheeses as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lübeck or ham of Parme, the cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp of and of (has kapr") and the hops of (chmel").
The bread of spice of Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Cones of () can equally be trusted their community brand.
The people want that I except the Republic, but I am only an amateur, declares itself senator Okamura
Mister the Senator, how do the idea one has to present itself to the presidential elections?
This is not to be senator or president that counts for me.
If all worked without problems in our country, I would not be candidate anything leaves.
But I no longer bear to see as the country is pillaged since these twenty last years, that the thieves are not under the locks and the taxes and the age of the departure to the retirement increase.
I did not have the ambition to become politician.
But when I see something that does not please me, then I stretched to bring a solution for that that changes.
And as I have more than forty years and than I am independent, member on no part, I do not have any other solutions to influence the position that to present me to the presidential or elections senatorial.
You entered to the Senate but you put yourself quickly in road for the Castle (N.d.T. : sits presidency).
You turn not thus the back to those that elected you?
I always said that I will launch myself in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections
Afterward, I specified that if I was elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this one is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
This is the reason why I need influence more big and mandate more wide.
The problem is not only that as nation we moan to the bar or in front of our television set, but it is as as we trample cough those that try to bring change.
Thereto adds the press that breaks the reputation of the people and confuses word liberty with liberty to lie.
One has, for example, asserted to my matter that I bribe the journalists or that I was the counselor of Paroubek.
Let's come in to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with as battle horse the themes of the material and penal responsibility the politicians and retroactive fiscal declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You have to this end to change the law.
As president, you do not dispose any a such to be able and only the Senate in his together can propose laws.
How do you want to resolve this problem?
When as citizen, I did pressure for that the activities of tourist guide constitutes a liberal profession, I obtained cause gain.
The problem this is the politicaillerie: when someone arrives left or right with a good project, this one knowingly is refused and that delays the citizens.
As independent, member on no part, I have a lot more luck to obtain the parliamentary support of all the parties.
I have the advantage of strength, without categorization and dogma supporters, take of every party which there is of better one for our country and to put it in application.
Do you consider yourself rather as a right or left man?
From the standpoint Czech, I have the impression that the people place me rather to the left.
For me, that this be a little to the left or to right, this is not really important.
For me, the important one it is that we forged ahead.
What counts for me is not that the people are left or right but to muster the people.
I supports always any contributing solution to the common good, even if she is proposed by the Communist party or ODS and I act all also impartially in opposition to bad ideas.
Do you enrage when someone says of you that you are a populist?
But which you declared not does it prove it?
When you elaborate a business plan in a business, you have also a certain optimum goal and a vision.
You try of you to compare some.
Some can call that of the populisme, but all the suggestions of which I speak were applied by the world and recognized experts in spoke.
But without the support of the parliament, it you remain only of the slogans.
You will survive not a long time in political with that.
Do you think that if you will see the people and to speak them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and responsibility penal?
I do not have any other option.
It is necessary for me to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public opinion and attempt rally them to my camp in order impose it.
If I was elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live to the television my request to the presidents on the part parliamentary to legislate on the material and penal responsibility the politicians, officials, judge and prosecutors.
They then eventually should explain why they not some want.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify the abuses, it will be possible to do pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president to the direct vote, she was obtained thanks to the pressure of the public opinion.
I had, without ambages, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and my visions.
I have just launched myself in political and I stretched to obtain the support of the majority for my program.
I try, alone, to let the things advance, and if that does not walk, I will stop in six years and I will return in the private sector.
This is a little as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that a single no one cannot do the difference, this is the reason why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present itself also to the senatorial elections.
I met Radim but it refused because of the quantity of work.
I have at least supported the journalist of investigation Jana Lorencová that revealed the frauds to the mazout.
I presented myself because the people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and which did it have, mostly, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
To the Senate, we are only two independent ones.
The people elected a Senate that with difficulty will be able to impose changes.
Despite all, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct vote of the mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you envision to be founded your clean party?
No, not again, because I do not have the time to verify if the passed of every potential member is without spot and then I not some have the financial means.
I do not have not more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
Do not you have any money?
You talk about fiscal, which declarations is it yours?
I estimate to about 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have at Prague a land of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value of ten million, another being worth apartment 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of about ten million, an Aston Martin that is worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb of a value of 1 million and some million on my account.
Is said while passing, I possess an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I always liked James Leap, that rolled by car, was gallant with the women and fought against the evil and the abuses.
You roll in Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you do not have any money for your country?
You want to change the Republic but you want not there to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for this country.
Should I get in debt?
I already invested 2 million and half in the country.
The Fact that I have no sponsor shows although my program does not give rise to a big interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this country of my pocket.
My campaign costs on the whole are covered by the remuneration that I will receive as senator.
But I do not can in to live, for example to pay the English school of my son that costs 30 thousand by months.
If my only objective was to earn money, I will not present myself to any election.
You go therefore to continue your commercial activities to be able to live?
Did you not assert that you would put your activities softly?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised it, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant one will take in the spring the direction of the agency of trip.
The people would want that I am a Samaritan one that except the Republic.
It is necessary nevertheless although I lively of something.
Which was your habitual monthly salary when you were contractor?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would put an end to my commercial activities.
You will find this interview in the edition of Saturday of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the office MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only matter of imagination. For itself to convince some, it suffices to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I find that this building is funny, it does very futuristic, at last something interesting to see", we says Lisette Verhaig, a pass on the shoulder of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a big business neighbors, we says: "Yes, it is effectively well beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we have again need today of a library.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, is more no one going of his own free will in one of these dated libraries, no?
Spijkenisse, a city dormitory that has nothing of appealing one to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record rather special.
The town of 80.000 souls posts the education rate the weakest one of the Netherlands.
In order to give again some neurones to the brains, the city decided, some years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that figure on the bills of Euros under the form of pretty miniature small ones in painted armed concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
It is as well as the authorities of the city went counts that there was only a single manner to resume the hand on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the diagrams in audacious sticks and structure creator a lot of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his habitual flegme and presented itself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a ricanement on the face.
And while the members of the jury looked at themselves again, disconcerted and shrugging, Maas, the sassy one, piled up its books choice by size order for some to do a pyramid, and finished his supported speech of arguments activists by a: "Dear town!"
The here, my suggestion for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as one says, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million Euros gushed earth.
The structure is in line with itself a project of revitalisation consisting of equally an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and joint houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the book mountain received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Of more, the project was selected for the National Dutch Wood Award 2012.
It is as well as this small dull village, that until today had nothing of more to offer than a zone pedestrian postmoderne and a city hall of a stupefying ugliness, of which the white facades invite to think that they shelter a dairy one, enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important one, it is that Spijkenisse possesses now the first public cultural structure of his history.
The long way towards the reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell to cheese.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massive one, but the true joys of the reading and architecture open to you when you trample the ground of the building to the discovery of his topography.
The completely done interior of glass is luminous and clear, the ground in Dutch bricks and the reflect elegant speak without ambiguity the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
One looks for already look of the public benches, dogs and small boys and granddaughters that play bullet.
And everywhere books, books and again books.
"Normally, the library rays are located alongside the facade and in the middle is located a big and dark room, that is often uncomfortable and impersonal", explains Willy Maas.
We completely distressed the classical spatial configuration and open the spaces of reading of the interior towards the exterior one.
The interior of the mountain of books skillfully was laid out: in the middle are located the offices, the library Internet, the failure club, the center for the environment and the central technique of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, that are sometimes panellings, sometimes railings, sometimes ramps of stairway.
A new experience for the view, to touch it and the sense of smell.
Even the architects and the engineers of the hardened building do not want any unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, boss of the project with the town of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard one.
This is as well as a day found us in an agricultural business frisian a loss ad hoc coming from farming.
To the Netherlands, one uses since years of the synthetic membrane of a millimeter of thickness as substratum in the greenhouses and the fields.
It is inexpensive and one saves time.
The fine membrane is used during one or two seasons, then one can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in of such quantities, in veneer of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of the heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms itself in a dark, homogenous and resistant material, of which the odor evokes at once a car nine and shoes of sport.
At the top of the 105 markets is located the summit of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, literary coffee offers us an unrestricted view on the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in jars.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It is unbelievable, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a project models regarding ecology", confides Trouborst.
The temperature of the structure is regulated by géothermie.
Although the book mountain is located underneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates only little time the interior, even the days of beautiful weather.
The thick beams in wood climbed crosswise in comparison with the glass facade use relative sun, intercepting a big party of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds load themselves with the remainder.
Stefan Spermon, the computer aforementioned septique, already risked itself to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also already was there.
Cynthia Bogarde, medicine Chinese traditional teacher, describes even the Boekenberg as "the at last rediscovered soul" of Spijkenisse.
Some weeks ago in fact, at the time of the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book coming from his personal library.
This measure allowed filling the emptinesses of the library that again completely was not outfitted (today, she counts 70.000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays overflow of any parts.
For the architect Winy Maas, "it there has nothing worse only a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation created a certain relation between every citizen and this new building.
Each knowledge that his book is part of this structure.
Even if it is only for the decoration."
It is as well as MVRDV attained the discipline mistress who one calls, in professional gibberish, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she can appear young and not very educated.
It is a matter at last of a new point of departure for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose the abstention at the time of the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and THE E.U., this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political position.
Deutsche Welle: At first week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain the statute of State observer with the United Nations.
But she next chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis did to Gassed.
Nevertheless, Berlin must show prudence, for she maintains special relations with Israel.
But I think as as she does not support not more the American position.
Germany wanted to assert his independence, without nevertheless to show itself too critical towards Israel.
At the time of the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany also had chosen the abstention at the time of the vote on set it up of a zone of aerial exclusion.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany test difficulties to adopt a clear position about the big international questions?
The response is yes.
The reason is some that Berlin is reviewing his political exterior one, looking for to move away itself from a political one so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a political exterior one German.
Of more, the lack of coherent political and town within the Union complicates the position.
The Germans bump themselves therefore to several foreheads.
One awaits of them that they play a more independent role, but they there are not accustomed.
I believe that they grope again to find this role, but are on the way of a political foreign one "more normal".
A political exterior one, as in France or in Great Britain
What does mean then concretely the term of foreign political one "normal" for the Germans?
She shows the will to adopt independent positions of the one of the United States and European partners, including in the matter of the national files.
I believe that the political German foreign one also is determined by his political economical one, therefore by the exportations and its relations with certain regions, as Russia, China or the Near East.
The German economical interests are, in a certain measure, different of those of the others big powers: this is the reason why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economical interests influence the position of the Germany with respect to the conflict to the Near East and the abstention at the time of the vote of the United Nations?
Germany has first of important unstopped ones to the Near East, especially in the countries of the Gulf.
This is the reason why Berlin must take keeps to not to bump the public opinion, but equally the elite of the Arabic countries.
It is a matter there without any doubts a determining element.
Nevertheless, I there would grant not too much importance, for it is not a matter no exclusively unilateral relation.
But this is there in any case a determining element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States while choosing the abstention at the time of important votes, as in the case of the Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans perfectly understand the German position.
This is the reason why I think that the break is not if engraves that she was it in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even that Germany will be only done more respect.
In fact, Germany thus showed that she must be taken to the serious one as international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are various.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of the European countries?
It there always had differences because of the American internal political scene.
I believe that the Administration Obama done secret proof of a big comprehension towards the European position.
But seen the configuration politics of the country, the government do not can well heard to defend his position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinions are not so big that they appear it always.
If you observe the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far to overflow enthusiasm with regard to politics of Netanyahou.
Does Germany test difficulties to reconcile its narrow relations with Israel and the United States, on one hand, with the position of the big European partners, on the other hand?
I think that that does not facilitate the things for the Germans.
Evidently, this would be a little simpler for the Germans if it existed a political European one coherent and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
They are not able therefore to register itself within a political line more vast and must assert their unique position.
This they do currently in the question of the Euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future a role of locomotive and will push Europe to adopt an European position.
This is not simple for Germany, notably because of the relations with Israel.
This question always was delicate.
But according to me, the Germans are well conscious on account of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Does Germany see itself to play a role of actor of weight on the international scene, does Germany want only to assume a role key?
Or does well she always have difficulties to assume roles of first plan?
Germany not yet is not accustomed, that is him always uncomfortable and, for evident reasons, the country tests always difficulties to play a more important role.
If one looks at, for example, the crisis of the Euro, one notices that every time that Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands do themselves to hear.
That does not facilitate the things for the Germans.
Indeed, this is always the same problem: one not wants to be encircled hostile countries.
Of this point seen, Germany is in a position well more delicate than the United States.
She must compose with neighbors and very varied opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on the political European one does nothing but to diminish, but in this moment, THE E.U. does not fill this emptiness, then that is there remaining?
The Germans simply will have to play a more important role.
And even if that not pleases them, even if that is them unpleasant and if they are only less appreciated, this is life!
Stephen Szabo is the assistant director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which of the university and experts in political of Europe and of North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also member of the German Marshall Fund, where it specialized himself in German political, in political American foreign and in transatlantic relations.
"Protection of the brands" in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands through the world.
Armani Polo... of what does it act itself really?
Behind this name hides itself a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original business.
The brand enjoys thus of a protection such as the business that in door the name cannot carry complaint.
And even if she could it, it is not sure that she would obtain cause gain.
"It is more and more difficult for the foreigners to protect their brands in China", explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the office Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the property rights in Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my office.
The imitators need only of some additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, one records Read gucci, and instead of Prada, one records prada-kny.
German businesses do themselves also to copy in any legality, as Puma, the manufacturer of items of sport.
Pattloch opens a file in which are located the carried out recordings with the office of the brands of Peking.
September 14 2010, a Chinese business deposited the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created while appropriating itself a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the method house.
It is one makes known that the Chinese became the champions of the world of the copy and violation of the intellectual property.
In the big cities, one finds commercial centers to several floors that sell practically only of forgeries.
The cases of Pattloch are nevertheless different: its constituents load it to attack itself to the Fact that the Chinese office of the brands confers officially to the Chinese businesses the right to use a name that already is protected in another country.
The Chinese talk about "Bang Mingpai", of similar brand.
The term is diverted from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that are designated the women that get married to rich men.
Chinese authorities say to have nothing to reproach itself.
"It is bad for the matters, it is necessary to fight against this tendency", demands Pattloch.
"The brand is édulcorée, the oddity disappears, the damages for the reputation are huge."
The financial losses and the justice expenses put a figure themselves in million for the concerned sectors, especially in the matter of the costly leading products.
According to the data of the corporation of analysis of the market CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion Euros, the third world-wide market of products of luxury and the one that develops the most quickly.
Nevertheless, it is not easy to remove the doubtful recordings of the register of the brands and these procedures cost a lot.
The latter can last until nine years, and the exit is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the processes during of which ones the course rejected the complaint, for after a long period, criticized name had become a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains us that if the pitying does not have any luck, it even can be obliged to pour money to the plagiaire, for it would have harmed his brand in China.
In this domain, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a lawful battle against the builder of machine of work-site Sany, the same business that had just repurchased the pump producer to concrete Putzmeister.
It is the reason the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, the acquisiteur of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo recalled the one of BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely dut to modify it.
The house of method Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and of Singapore that had reorientated the look of the famous crocodile in the opposed direction.
According to Chinese authorities, they are not guilty anything.
The office of the brands CTMO to Peking admits nevertheless to have known some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and of space.
Nevertheless, the office would be passed last year of an "urgency position in the sequence of the work to a rediscovered normalcy".
Thus, the number of the procedures of non treated opposition would have lowered of 22%.
Close to 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% in comparison with the preceding year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain in suffering to the office.
Act costs a lot
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
The past year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million requests of deposit of brand, almost a third of more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a matter of a record and that means that China is located for the tenth consecutive time in head of the classification for the number of the new deposits in the world.
That would be worth also for the total number of the legal brands, that is of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of right of inscription.
In of other terms, every recording retrieved in average 1.280 yuan, or 160 Euros.
A lawful battle costs well more, as the illustrates the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
Since more than seven years, the business fights against a Chinese plagiaire.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended.
Nevertheless, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
"This is our fault, for the family names not can be protected in Germany", explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities to Munich.
The office of the brands had therefore rejected the objection of the of munich one.
Freudenberg of course obtained cause gain with the two following instances, but the adverse party continues to beat itself until today.
Vigilance is placement
Today, the matter is in instance with the supreme Court.
Wentzler is confiding, it believes in a positive exit of the process and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, it adds: "The procedure is long, testing and we cost a lot of times and of money."
It is equally difficult to evaluate the internal costs. The service of the archives even had to review the acts of the last cents years in order to bring proofs.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even had proposed in vain to the adverse party a "big sum in Euros to six figures" to regulate the litigation.
"It is thereto that one sees what that represents for us", confides Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to overflow up to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region assured themselves the exploitation of the non protected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a business of production of shoe and of leather.
The business had since a long time abandoned this sector, but she had been able nonetheless to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is placement".
Pattloch and counsel him to the German businesses to show a big prudence in their commercial relations with China.
It does not suffice, according to them, to trust the international right of the brands, the foreigners should rather "record also in China all that is likely to be protected", as the says Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be well more important than those of the recording.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the time of the last act of his lawful drama, the business should pay rights of license to the adverse party for the usage of his own name, as the explains Wentzler.
Or then, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World-wide day of fights against the Aids: to type foot, sing, help
The choral Imbongi repeats to Heidelberg, and the orphans of the Aids of the Swaziland rejoice at their coming.
Here the history of a link that crosses well more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, one types foot: the boots of cowboy, the basketballs, the pumps for the ladies and the mocassins for the men look for the rhythm while striking the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Next, the voices of the singers amplify themselves slowly - alto, low, ténor and soprano -, they take themselves, enchant and follow themselves.
Fiete Hopf, the boss of orchestra of 29 years loses almost its shoes of canvas when it directs the orchestra with its gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choral Imbongi repeats a new song in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers of 23 to 69 years came, généticienne in human medicine to the man to the home.
"Om'obani" is not an easy piece, every choir member has different words, the all in a very exotic language: the zoulou, a spoken language by 11 millions of people in South Africa, to the Botswana, to the Lesotho, to the Malawi, to the Mozambique and in certain regions of the Swaziland.
To be helped to help itself
The ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations of fights against the Aids, considers that 34 millions of people through the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
The Swaziland counts 245.000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is séropositive.
180 orphans of the Aids of the town of Esitjeni found godfathers in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them frequent an establishment of secondary teaching.
For 15 or 20 Euros by less, one can become godfather.
This sum guarantees to the child of the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal to the center gogo.
Imbongi means in zoulou "history storyteller" or well again "praise singer".
No one can speak often the bantu language in this region, but all can sing it.
Since near of 10 years, the choral one repeats songs in this foreign language that she brought in Germany for now to return it to his natal region: the South of Africa.
For to 8.733 kilometers to flight of bird of Heidelberg, in the Northwest of the Kingdom of the Swaziland, is located Esitjeni, the town that depends on the vocal power of the choral German one.
40% of attained people
The town counts about 2.000 inhabitants, certain screws in of modest huts of straw or of earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 between them are orphans, for the VIH took their parents.
To Esitjeni, one can observe to smaller ladder the evil that overwhelm the Swaziland: the infection rate to the the highest VIH and life expectancy more low to the world according to the UNICEF.
The population never accepts practically masculine circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proved reduction of the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of the population of the Swaziland is carrier of the virus of the immunodeficiency and it is not rare to die in the middle of the about thirty.
At the time of a group trip in Africa in the spring 2005, the choral one had been able to discover the town. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street to that it lacked not only the parental cares, but also all simply all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diploma, it does not have all good any perspective.
At first, it was only some people that were involved themselves personally to pour some Euros each year in order to be able to send a child to the school and of him to offer a hot meal a day.
But scarcely a year later, the choral one was founded "Voices for Africa", an association that takes care since at the time of almost professional manner of the orphans of the Aids of Esitjeni.
Do about the sexually transmittable infections
Which are the sexually transmittable diseases the more running?
Among the bacterial IST, one counts the syphilis, the chlamydiées and the blennorragie (or gonorrhée).
The current IST are the VIH, the virus of the human papillome, the genital herpès or the hepatitis.
The poux of the pubis and the mange belong to the parasitic IST.
Which are the principally concerned groups?
The syphilis and the blennorragie appear often with the men that have sexual relations with of other men.
The institute robert-koch considers that the sexual contacts between men are at the at least origin four cases of syphilis on five informers in Germany.
With the adults hétérosexuels, the infections linked to the chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidose (fungal), the blennorragie and the virus of the human papillome are sexually current transmittable diseases.
The rate of propagation of the VIH between adults hétérosexuels is comparatively low in Germany. Nevertheless, some 20% of the new infections to the VIH are observed within this group.
With the young ones, one observes an infection rate linked to the noticeably chlamydiées more student than with the others group population.
Of after the European reliefs, the three quarters of all the infections concern the young ones of age 15 to 25 years.
Of more, in Germany, the virus of the human papillome is current with the young ones.
Which is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obligatory to declare all the sexually transmittable diseases.
According to the Institute robert-koch, the number of the cases of syphilis has more doubled in 10 years: the figure is passed of 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of the new infections to the VIH diminish.
In 2011, there were about 2.700 cases.
That represents a decrease of a tenth one in comparison with the preceding year.
Which are the sexual symptoms of a disease?
The infectious diseases can provoke abscesses at the level of the genital organs, urinary pains, white losses, pains to the low stomach as well as the appearance of buttons and of warts.
Nevertheless, they do not induce uniformly any pain or other symptom and remain therefore hidden.
How to protect itself?
The preservatives can diminish the infection risk, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is some that the pathogenic agents of the sexually transmittable diseases also can transmit themselves by lubricating infection or by narrow physical contacts.
The experts recommend therefore to any changeable person often of sexual partners to pass uniformly examinations.
Most of the quickly identified IST can be healed and the late séquelles can be avoided.
Thanks to the parrainages, to the gifts, but especially to the funds that harvest the choir members thanks to their voices through entire Germany, the means accumulate themselves.
"In all, we already sent about 200.000 Euros to Esitjeni", precise Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
To the town, Zodwa Dlamini, a sure woman of oneself and that always obtains what she wants, manages the money in origin of Germany.
She watches also to this as the orphans are well lodged, with one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, this is as well as one calls the old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the town.
Certain of them welcome until 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and watch to what they go every day per hour to the school in their uniforms.
The orphan that no longer has person is welcomed in a sure place, with Khanyisile, a woman that lives alone and is paid by the association, just as the two ranges that prepare every day the meals for more than 200 starving children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a school of sewing and allowed the construction of two henhouses. With the competition of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized a test of screening of the VIH for many inhabitants.
That does not go any oneself, for even if the disease is well visible in the whole country, she remains a subject taboo.
A king and its 14 spouses
"The Aids is a true taboo", explains Annette Lennartz, "for it is a subject that touches sexuality."
This is rather curious, coming from a country of which the king has 14 official spouses.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his style of excessive life.
The polygamie instead of the democracy.
These morals punished by the State, among others, are responsible of the quick propagation of the observed VIH the latter decades.
The migrant workers equally disseminated the virus through the country.
One finds nevertheless preservatives to every corner of street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to favor somewhat the cultural exchange, the choir members of Imbongi leave together in travels both of them or three years in the South of Africa and start singing songs fill nostalgia, of courage, of confidence and of black identity that number of inhabitants of the known point of the dark continent again of the time of apartheid.
The full bus of white ones that sing in African language is a recognition sign such as it generates not only good mood and joy, but pulls out sometimes also a tear to some fearsome guards border.
The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the choir members return visits to their godsonren.
Even if it is difficult to find the small town on a card, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you there will find light", say the people over there.
And after a trip of 8.733 kilometers to bird flight, of return to Heidelberg, in front of these choir members that type foot in the room of repetition of the Bergheimer Straße, one finds also the light.
Messenger: the NASA discovers the ice presence on Mercury
The probe Messenger retrieved proofs of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could attain 20 meters of thickness.
The American spatial agency NASA proved the ice existence on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest one of the Sun, she contains frozen water, as the explain three published studies this Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The probe Messenger retrieved proofs of the existence of a cover of ice in the region of the planet in permanence dived in the shadow.
This cover would have one at least thickness 30 centimeters being able to go until 20 meters.
Water probably originates comets or maybe of asteroids that would have bumped Mercury.
Nevertheless, no one does link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the scientist in boss of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can attain 426 Celsius degrees.
The discovery could help to understand how water and of other essential elements to life arrived in of other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, of the crush and small robots as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth, such of the small cracks through which these one observes the infinite one.
The picture originates of a photographic device developed by German researchers of the Institute max-planck.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet naine Cérès.
As Pluton, that orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not considered as a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of a photograph infrarouge taken by crushes it Spitzer shows a "family portrait" innumerable generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the room of delivery of the universe.
Crushes it Spitzer discovered this region where are born the stars, baptized “W5", a name well not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopée, to 6.500 light-years.
Crushes it Spitzer of the NASA photographed the blazing brightness of a star in the process of dying.
The circle in doughnut form is composed from elements that the star projects when she dies.
In the immense nebula Trifide, to 5.400 light-years of the Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
Crushes it Spitzer photographed this room of delivery galactique.
The Groups, heap of stars equally called "the seven sisters", can be observed to the nude eye during the night.
Nevertheless, crushes it puts more the colors in value.
On this photo infrarouge, the nebula of Propellor, as a red eye, looks at directly the spectator.
She is located to 700 light-years in the constellation of the Aquarius.
Its resemblances with an earthly continent were worth him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and photo infrarouge allows observing a spectacular complexion.
Only the detectors infrarouges of the crushes Spitzer were able to capture a picture of the new star in all his beauty.
One of the bigger enigmas of the astronomy concerns the creation of the rings of Saturn.
A theory is that the rings are the remainders of a moon of Saturn that disappeared there are 4.5 billion years without leaving tracks.
One of the photographs more big and the more clear ones than took crushes it Hubble is the one of the galaxy of the Whirlwind.
According to the complexion, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European southern Observatory watch the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, to several thousands of light-years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided in three), for three led ones of dust divide the shiny heart of the birthplace of the stars.
The astronomers photographed the cosmic beginnings of a pile-up in the constellation of the Serpentaire: to 400 millions of light-years of the Earth, the kernels of two galaxies in merger precipitate themselves the one towards the other, the collision is inevitable.
Crushes it Hubble observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of "wheel of southern fire".
The photo of the crushes spatial Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebula is located to 1.400 light-years and is composed from grains of dust that are ten to hundred smaller time than current domestic dust.
This photo was elaborated from the clichés views and radiographiques take by different crush.
One there can see the composed circle of the black holes that is located to 430 millions of light-years of the Earth.
Crushes it spatial photographed for the NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273.
The scientists named the biggest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is located the group of stars young the most luminous one of our milky way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, that are linked up by the nebula of the Rosette, create also in permanence of young stars to 5.000 light-years of the Earth.
In this galaxy to the luminous and pierced rays of a small black hole, it exists not again dust, there is only gas.
The scientists think that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogenates.
Our look on the universe: the principal ones crush
Crushes it would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilée used not it a year later to observe the stars.
Since, the mirrors of the crush views did not stop increasing and thanks to them, it was possible to always see further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, crushes it Hauls Observatory of the mount Palomar close to San Diego was the biggest one crushes world.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In the Arizona, to the United States, is located the Wide Binocular Telescope.
It allows observing the universe through two mirrors having each a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The stomach of the Gran Telescopio Canarias to The Caliper, to the islands Canaries, is immense. The mirror to him only attains a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Wide Telescope in South Africa was segmented in order to save money.
The diameter attains anyway about eleven meters.
The inconvenience of the method of economical construction is that crushes it is set up at the level of the vertical angle, which in limit the mobility.
Crushes it hobby-eberly to the Texas also is set up him at the level of the vertical angle.
His characteristic be anxious his big capacity of collection of light.
Despite a diameter of mirror comparatively small, this capacity comes close to itself the one of the biggest ones crush to mirrors of the world.
The scientists listen the universe to the earthly first rate signal research using the radiotélescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owner of a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "research of earthly first rate intelligence") while putting to contribution the power of calculation of his machine.
Seen on the southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andess.
Here is located the Wide Very Telescope ("very big crushes"), a worthy installation of his name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this crushes can light up the ghost infrarouge average.
The construction of a very big one crushes European (European Wide Extremely Telescope) is equally foreseen for the site of the ESO to Chile.
His principal mirror should attain the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed closely of 1.000 elements of mirrors.
Nevertheless, crushes it will not be able to take clichés before 2018 as soon as possible.
Up to 2007, the two crush Keck on the volcano hawaïen of the Mauna Kea were considered as the biggest ones of the world.
They sported two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Crush them Keck are part of the observatory of the Mauna Kea that observes the sky with crushes it Subaru and the IRTF.
A new one crushes gigantic should equally be constructed on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of his mirror will attain 30 meters.
This illustration allows admiring it.
Nevertheless, the pictures of the space more important we originate of the crushes spatial Hubble.
Since April 24 1990, it delivers us pictures of the removed worlds.
Since March 2009, crushes it spatial Kepler looks for exoplanets, essentially the one that are habitable.
The NASA announced February 2 2011 that she had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the last preparations before the launch of the crushes spatial Kepler.
Crushes it spatial james-webb (JWST) will be sent in the space as soon as possible in 2018 on board of a rocket Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the crushes spatial infrarouge has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
Crushes it will have notably for mission to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
The scientists think that the center South of Mercury shelters also ice.
Nevertheless, no reliable data on this theory exists, for Messenger orbits well more close to the center North of Mercury.
The data radars indicated since decades the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first one to orbit around Mercury, the scientists in have now the certainty.
Drink daily butter, and live until 168 years
In the South of the Azerbaïdjan, many people attain of the worthy ages of the patriarches of the Bible.
One there finds even a museum of the longevity.
An investigation on a country, in which one is again comparatively young to 97 years.
In the South of the Azerbaïdjan, many people attain of the worthy ages of the patriarches of the Bible.

An investigation on a country, in which one is again comparatively young to 97 years.
The trip in the mountains Talysh is of a romanticism échevelé.
To the detour of the numerous turns of the road, the small bus bounces alongside wooded hills, of torrential rivers and of modest farms.
All is green and fertile, one would believe oneself almost in the Black Forest.
But we are located here in the deep South of the Azerbaïdjan, the border with the Iran is only to some kilometers.
It is here that lives the caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, appropriate of which one does not know big thing, if it is only they perfectly speak the persian and the azéri and that they have a very big longevity.
Terminal: Lerik.
The small city covers with his too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that not at all agrees with the landscape of picturesque mountain.
The European tourists are rare here, the trip since the capital of the Azerbaïdjan, Bakou, is well too painful.
It is necessary eight hours to traverse the 323 kilometers, for the road has only a single way.
The province did not again take advantage legendary wealth that the country has to its oil reserves in the sea Caspienne.
Nevertheless, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is persuaded that Lerik has the potential one to become a tourist place.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the competition of the Eurovision, and next year, there will be here the festival of the people more old of the world", explains Fatulayeva.
She is guiding of the museum of the longevity, the only museum of the sort to the world.
One there can discover about life eight tens of Talysh of the region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here my grandfather, it attained the age of 120 years.
Have again a child to 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Müslümov, a shepherd that would have been 168 years old.
It does not exist nevertheless any birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest person informed was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more doubtful.
"It was born in 1805 in this region, it is dead in 1973", precise Fatulayeva.
The man would have gotten married three times and it would have had 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it again would have conceived a girl.
Müslümov would it be cheated itself of some decades while calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist to the Institute max-planck of Rostock, also heard about him the man to the big age of central Asia.
"Surprisingly elderly people screws also in certain regions of China, to Japan or in the valley of Hunza to the Pakistan", explains Scholz, "in Sardinia also, there are men that live unbelievably old."
Nevertheless, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof because of the inexistence of the documents, without counting that there was not register of civil state.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless fact that the people of the region of Lerik attain often a worthy age of the patriarches of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
Which is therefore the reason of the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guide azéri, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that this is a nutrition question.
Nevertheless, it does not seem plausible, from the standpoint nutritional, that the rich meals in calories of the Talysh, that like meat, the bread and especially the dairy products and of which a lot drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or does well being this the method of simple life that preserve the youth of the people? To Cengemiran, a tiny town close of the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, she is again comparatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, that asserts to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house of wood, as it is typical of visible one in the very region of the Caucase.
She is sat on the ground next to a churn, of which she beats the content untiringly.
Eight people live here under a single roof, among which ones one of the son of Mirzayeva and a girl, that are since a long time adults.
Two small children gambol also in the house.
In the kitchen, one prepares tea for the guests served in glasses armadus typical in stomach form.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva perfectly are aligned, and under his scarf hide themselves long braids of a blond dark one that his son reveals us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and this is as well as I never lost them and only they kept their color.
"I never used shampooing", adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly retirement suffices to live
She always ate what originates of his clean farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small peas.
Of all my life, I never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Next, she talks about us his husband that was in the army.
The worse moments were after the Second World War.
But all improved when the "well-loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of publicity astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
Nevertheless, the worship of the paternal face of the nation, a man that nevertheless directed his country as a dictator, not connait almost any limits in Azerbaïdjan
It was in power up to 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterward.
Although it is some, the people of age Azerbaïdjan not known distress.
Mirzayeva monthly receives 230 manats (about the same sum that in Euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And maybe that the son since a long time graying of Mirzayeva has reason: "The oldest children enjoy a big respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are liked, cared for and happy.
Here a good reason to live the most more a long time most possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution reemerges to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep break of the country.
The project of based constitution on the charia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not miserly filled words of emotions.
We must succeed the transition.
"And this success is of my responsibility towards the people and towards God", it declared to the television of State.
His speech was intended for the people completely, but also especially to the Christian Copts, to the liberals, Moslem enlightened and civil.
For all the members of the confused and desperately separated opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nil to the hands of the powerful Moslem Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi declared, almost while being sorry, temporarily to have restricted the competences of the constitutional and widened Course hers "in order to save the revolution".
Nevertheless, the Egyptians and the world know not really what wants to save this engineer of 61 years, tenured of a phd of the American university of California of the South.
Will the judicial strength be reversed?
The 234 composed items to the haste by the constituent majority Islamic assembly of 100 people at the time of a turn of night force of fifteen hours are effectively disturbing in a certain measure.
As in preceding constitutions, the project foresees that the jurisprudence rests on "the principles of the Islamic right".
But that does mean really the word "principles"?
It was and that always remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons for fear that the Islamists use vague wording and the lawful room to maneuver that about it results to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any case it is that gives to think an item newly introduces stipulating that, in the matter of all the subjects touching on the charia, the university Al azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the Islamic institution the most important one of the country and his brightness radiates on Islamic everyone sunnite.
That can, but wants not necessarily to say that the clergy will oversee the legislative device, which would induce de facto put it under guardianship of the judicial strength.
Many points of the project of Constitution are matter to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts employed themselves to repress the opposing.
After the fall of the dictator, until 11.000 civil ones were held by the military officers.
The state has also, can one to read in the project, to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "to promote his moral and its values".
From the standpoint lawful, wording is so vague that the institutions of the State even could check the content of the art films and literature.
In clear, it would be a matter all simply of censorship.
Of more, no item guarantees expressly the equality between the men and the women.
Instead of that, another item forbids to offend or to slander the prophet Mohammed or its envoys.
On the other hand, the item does not define what is an offense or how she must be punished.
All so doubtful one is wording giving to understand as it is forbidden of" to offend the people".
Does it suffice to draw a caricature of the president or to relate a jokes to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore matter to interpretation in the project that Morsi subjects to the vote and that, according to its own words, will do "very soon" the object of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution renait"
The opposition mobilizes itself since weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of show mustered themselves in an unusual concord on the place Tahrir to Cairo, promising to drop the charia before she enters in force.
"The revolution reemerges and we will win", launches Hamdin Sabbahi, third arrival to the presidential elections.
The price Nobel of peace and former boss of the international Agency of the atomic energy Mohamed El Baradei declared that the project of Constitution is "to throw in the garbage cans of the history".
On Twitter, the service of instantaneous package service, it accused the favoring Morsi to want to instigate a "putsch against the democracy".
"If it proclaims the referendum, one will go to his palace and one will reverse it", exclaims itself Jasser Said, an opposing one.
"We did not again tire, the blood of our brothers again is not paid for", declared according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced not to want to oversee the referendum, which would induce his bummer.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Of his side, the Moslem brotherhood, well organized, called for one against demonstration not on the place Tahrir as a precautionary measure, but on the other shore of the Nil, where a big prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo.
The veiled women and the favoring salafistes, that there participated in big number, scanned: "The people claims the application of the law of God."
"Cleans our country!", they asked Morsi, while asserting that "the Koran [was their] Constitution".
A fight for the sovereignty on the symbolic place Tharir, where all began, well quickly would have generated a similar position to the one of a civil war.
Quite obviously is what favoring Morsi wanted them to avoid.
The Moslem Brothers declared that the opposing to the project of Constitution, in the same way as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to leave the people to decide by the ballot boxes of the direction that must take the country.
The project of the Islamists will win certainly the majority.
"The human rights are not mentioned a single time"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this constitutional taxed process that should have extended itself up to February and include all the social forces.
This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of the human rights (EOHR) had defended the Moslem Brothers when they were in prison or in front of the courts under Moubarak.
It did it not because it divided their conception of the world, but because for him the human rights are indivisible.
This is the reason it was cunning blows, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term even is not pronounced once in the new Constitution", it regrets during the course of his discussion with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the strengths of Morsi to the three strengths discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are of the attained screaming to the rules of the democracy and they will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of reinforcing the civil corporation, the president removes him de facto all its strengths", deplores Saeda.
Nevertheless, a democracy cannot work without organizations of the civil corporation.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, that looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nil with a mixture of curiosity and of nervousness.
That could pay itself.
A showing one on the place Tharir warns: "You deliver of a monster that it will not be you more possible to check."
Is the rakfisk of Norway: it a question of the fish more fragrant of the world?
The five millions of people that populate the Norway benefit from one of the higher levels of life, not only in Europe, but equally in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of the local ones for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a battery of wet clothing of soccer and dirty.
Await a week.
And you obtain the disturbing odor of the rakfisk, the one of the placement the done more prize Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, to about 3 hours of Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk is composed sprinkled trout of salt and fermented in the water for a length - according to the odor that you want that it exhales - that can go until a year.
When obscurity installs itself and that it is cold, the Norwegian ones muster themselves in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, to Fagernes, devoted to this unbelievable culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit", explains Havard Halvarsen, local on time full fireman that one calls equally "Rakfisk General", person in charge of the management of the festival.
Around us, the people avalent of small pieces of fish and devour a big quantity of drink.
"Certain people prefer the aquavit to the rakfisk", adds Havard.
The drink kills the odor.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid doing it to pass under your nose, is bad - that does to think about a sushi that would have passed long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to an era where the Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water stem to the air, then salty in the fall.
Next, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish took out and - without any doubts with the direction weaken by alcohol - eaten.
To the preceding generation, thousands of Norwegian ones were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrant principally towards the United States.
At present, the population develops quickly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full job, the high salaries and a system of complete health.
The Swedish one, their old rivals of which the country was there is not so a long time richer than the Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, of the passed Norway.
That is part of the dishes more dear.
But all is dear - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10€each.
The done Norway not often to talk about her in the international current events, which is not for him to displease.
Here, the people are not disposed to talk about Anders Breivik, the right extremist racist that cut down 77 people, among which ones of the women and children.
When they evoke this killings, they talk about "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegian ones have trouble to accept that in their peaceful country, the one of the their was able to commit such a act of barbarity.
Since the beginning of the years 70, the Norway has his wealth to his oil and gas industry the one of the more important ones to the world.
"But the oil is not the unique reason that justifies our success", explains Anna, our waitress, to the blond hair and to the eyes of a blue piercing one, the picture of Nordic well-being, with a plateau of rakfisk to the hand.
We are - how you say - prudent people.
His English, as the one of most of the people that live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to point out ourselves.
The Norway managed his oil wealth with a lot of prudences - all, with the exception of a weak percentage of money coming from this industry, is invested in a special funds to the profit of the future generations.
When of other countries threw the money by the windows, during the years that drove us to the international financial crisis, the Norway knew to keep the well squeezed cords of his stock markets.
"As long as one can ski in the winter and do the hike in summer, we are happy", precise Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk", she adds in a carefree laugh.
I hold myself standing under the snow and I do the tail to buy me of what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
To the menu, a composed hamburger of momentum, a true discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the odor of the fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is the one of the numerous places where one uses the rakfisk for dinner and where one can vote for the better one of them - or maybe for the most fragrant one of them.
There is a transmission of TV where the presenter carries a knot butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
One would believe oneself the competition of the Eurovision.
"Which score did you give to the better fish, in the mountains thor-juergen?"
"Here our points, Havard."
One hears laughs and applause.
A man falls of his chair, maybe because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe this is because of fish fumes.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto known a difficult departure.
While the President entering Enrique Pena Nieto gets ready to take its functions to Mexico, Will Grant, BBC, is very interested in the difficulties that the await and to the expectations of the people, that are numerous.
The road circulation to Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where the traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security barrier was set up since Monday, blocking several road accesses keys in the capital and provoking a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to prevent the people to go to their work, but to prevent the showing to attain the Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task the awaits.
The economy of Mexico carries itself well, results that one has to the president going out Felipe Calderon, but the country is in prey to a war of the drug that already cost the life to about 60.000 people in six years.
"My government took the engagement towards the Mexican people to reduce the violence", declared Mr. Pena Nieto to the American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new strategy in security matters that will allow us to attain this goal.
Before mixing with the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state encloses the capital. On his predilection earth, the opinions concerning this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Cheer, for example, it was in line with the memory of all.
The local ones attribute him the development of tourism and infrastructures in the town.
To rejoin the city, you can take the one of the new expressways of M Pena Nieto, an important improvement was brought to these roads, formerly dented and a lot of crevices.
Plates sporting his name are hung to the exterior one of a new athletic complex and of an interactive impressive dedicated museum to the climatic change.
"We count on him to set up of the durable changes", declared his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and on the part of M Pena Nieto, the PRAY.
In terms of security and of economy notably, we hope a true change of which our country has so need.
After 81 years without in power rift, the PRAY was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the congress Olvera admits that after 12 past years outside of the presidential palace of The Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the concerning party Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the critics of the opposing that accuse the new president to lack charisma.
This is an entire man, very engaged, with an excellent vision of the country.
This is an excellent man of State and, by over all, it knows to listen.
Nevertheless, it is not always the picture that have the people of their former governor.
To Nezahualcoyotl, equally known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Cheer could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the autoponts of the expressways, she constitutes, to several consideration, a suburbs of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are equally concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military officers were called for the rescousse to fight against the drug gangs that hold sway in the neighborhoods, and the violence done to the women there are particularly engrave.
In a stricken zone, one rediscovered, in disposal edge, the bodies of tens of murdered women during the two last years.
More than 1.000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate well higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly celebrates for the number of innocent women that there were killed.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that to the better, it did not succeed containing the problem of the perpetrated murders against the women when it was in function.
To the worse one, they accuse his administration to refuse to see the reality straight out.
In a house in concrete, typical of this deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights to keep its tears when she shows me defunct photos of his girl, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
Nevertheless, his family thinks that she was killed by his partner.
"When I arrived at her place, it seemed to me that his body had been washed", relates the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and deathly pale rigidity already was begun.
While his mother relates the history, a photo of dressed Mariana the wall, next to a cross where figures the word: Justice.
Nevertheless, this is exactly what the family see itself refused.
Authorities treated me as if I was an old gossip, a disturbance fautrice, a sniveller.
They want that one accepts what they say and that one oneself taise.
"But this is not normal that there are as much irregularities and of omissions", she declared.
When the President Pena Nieto receive his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied of a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families were touched by the crime to the Mexico during the six last years and the new president did the promise that it would do his priority during his mandate.
"I hope that it will be so good as president as when it was governor", declared Olvera, to Valle del Cheer, member of the Congress.
Nevertheless, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the more.
Bradley Manning did not complain about bad treatments, declare the prosecutors.
The prosecutors try to oppose the abuse claims of which Bradley Manning would have been victim at the time of the detention.
The process concerns the detention of Manning in a military prison to Quantico, in Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the matter to the motive that the confinement of Manning was done in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused to have robbed thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors attempted to show, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused to be at the origin of the biggest escape of confidential information of all the history of the American army -- lacked many occasions to complain about the bad treatments than it claims to have undergone at the time of his military detention.
At the time of one against questioning with Manning, for a preliminary audience to Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein asserted that of the recordings of weekly visits returned to Manning by officers during its nine months of detention to Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaint concerning his treatment.
The against questioning -- during an audience, the defense presented an exacting request that the matter Manning is classified to the motive that confinement was done in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently harsh punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his craving to commit suicide during his detention.
This analyst of the military piece of information, stopped in June 2010, is accused to have robbed thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents next were published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the time of the audience of Friday, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their encounter with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where it was subjected to a maximum prison isolation of July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and recorded its responses.
When Fein evoked the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that reserved him its guards was "excellent" and that the treatment that it had had within the prison was on the whole "very professional."
The forms do not mention any complaint for bad treatment, although the officers directly questioned it on the subject of his prison treatment, asserted Fein.
Manning replied that it orally had expressed worries concerning certain problems and that the officers in visit had discussed its worries and indicated that they would take care some, but they did not record the evoked problems.
"They wrote" no problem" (after approaching the worries), and for as much, that did not mean that I had not raised problems", declared Manning.
The military judge Collar. Denise Lind, equally asked Manning why it had not complained about his treatment at the time of a discussion in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts that it had expressed in writing some months beforehand.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to let his restrictive statute modify indicating a "risks injury".
The military officers declared that they had assigned him this restrictive statute -- a level underneath the compared supervision for suicide risk -- for his protection and the security of the others.
"I wanted that the personnel knows that I went well, and I wanted that one withdraws me this statute... in order benefit from a better quality of life from the standpoint", declared Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and of his transfer to Kuwait, where it was held during near of two before being transferred months to the military prison of the basis of the Body of the Navies to Quantico, in Virginia, in July 2010.
It declared having envisioned to commit suicide when it was at Kuwait and to have fainted once because of the heat.
It added that the not fact to have been held during the course of what it was going to arrive him or of what happened in the remainder of the world was very alarming.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", declared Manning, Thursday.
I thought that I was going to die in this cage.
Once to Quantico, Manning declared that it had passed the clearest one of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning equally added that the only objects of which it disposed were a matelas, a cover, flip-flopses, clothing and its glasses.
It tried to remain in movement, for to sleep or to remain lengthened during the day was in contrast to the regulation.
Manning equally specified that when it tried to sleep, it had a light in the eyes, lit to the exterior one of his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when it returned himself the night, they awakened it in order to be able to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning deposited a definite complaint for the treatments undergo by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison to Strong Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Friday equally, the judge asked questions to Manning concerning a retrieved allegation in his testimony of Thursday -- that after forcing sleeping nude all a night in his cell to Quantico, one forced it to hold itself nude in front of the guards and of held others a morning, during the call.
Manning testified that to no moment, it was not allowed him to cover itself with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning declared that it had deducted on the order of his guard that it had to loosen his cover that could have hidden his bareness, but it recognized that no one had ordered him to loosen it.
Manning testified Thursday that it had been forced to sleep nude the preceding night, for it would have attempted to prove to an officer that it was not a danger for itself.
Manning would have declared to the officer that it could have used the rubber band of his underpants or its flip-flopses to injure itself, but that it had not done it.
That night, Manning testified that its under clothing, its flip-flopses, and its glasses had been withdrawn of his cell.
Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences that it lived during his detention and that it considerably will reduce his sentence if it had to be recognized guilty in front of a martial course, a process that should be held at the beginning of next year.
The defense declared that Manning envisions to plead guilty of offences the less engrave and to beat itself for the other abandonment load judged too extreme.
The audience should resume this weekend, with prosecutors that should deduce that the detention conditions were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation that governs the conditions of detention of all the prisoners to Quantico.
The carried bosses of accusation in opposition to Manning include the flight of goods or of public documents, the collusion with the enemy, giving place to the illegal publication of pieces of information on the Internet, and the information transmission relating to the national defense.
If all the bosses of accusation are kept, it incurs the criminal imprisonment for life.
My identity crisis mexico-américaine
It says that a lot were forced to leave the Mexico because of the timeliness lack
The Mexican ones tend to criticize those that left; they recall to the Mexican the difficult periods, it declared.
Said Navarrette that the mexico-américains rediscover themselves take between two worlds.
At the time of a recent trip to Mexico, while arriving in the lobby, in front of the services of customs and of immigration, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing towards which line to direct me.
I grew in the center of the California, where one called me the "Mexican" all my life.
It is a matter of an ethnic qualifier, in the same way as the one that my friends of Boston use when they are said "Irish", or my friends of New York when they are said "Italians".
Next, I became "mexico-américain".
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that see been born my grandfather, no need of special qualifier or of hyphen.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, sufficiently well to manage a discussion in the an or the other language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and I cannot lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and I directed myself towards the line "Foreigners".
I thought at that very moment week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto returned visits to the President Obama, to the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection themes are the immigration, the drug and the commerce.
Pena Nieto had equally envies to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, that is the one of the reasons that push the Mexican ones to remain at Mexico rather than to risk itself to the United States.
It wishes to ally himself to the United States and to Canada, and create a Union for the commerce on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is involved itself to follow the war against the coalitions of the drug to Mexico, although it did not furnish more details.
For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most of the Americans probably never reflected to the Fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield in writing the half of their territory to the point of the rifle.
But for the Mexican ones, that reflect in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Consequently, as soon as an official U.S. formulates the least critic with regard to Mexico, you begin hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints on the manner of which the Americans carry attained to the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma look for the scuffle.
And nevertheless, for Mexico, relation more difficult is the one than the country maintains with more than 35 million them mexico-américains that live to the United States.
You want that one approaches the subject of bitterness?
There are some a lot.
Mexico has its winning and its losers, people for that the country offers timeliness and of others for that the country not in offer.
The only reason that explains the big number of Mexican ancestors in cities as Los Angeles, Tired Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that to a given moment, in our genealogical tree, a person, maybe a parent or a grandparent, did not find any timeliness to Mexico and had to go in the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, little instructs, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal towards them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we live currently the American dream, that we went in of good schools and that we have good positions, we must never lose view that it is the American dream that we live, and not the one of the Mexican ones.
Our identity sometimes is disrupted, but our loyalty is evident.
We grant it to the United States.
Besides, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the directing class does not like ourselves.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We recall them a humiliating defeat and they regard us as if we were individuals of inferior stump and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spaniard will never be rather good, our links with Mexico will never be rather strong.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived to Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not meet again jammed of the good side of the barrier, living comfortably to the United States, but as lost souls.
My woman that was born to Guadalajara and that emigrated legally to the United States while she was child, reminds me that there exist the frictions between the Mexican and the mexico-américains, for the Mexican ones claim firmlyer their identity and the mexico-américains are annoyed some.
Although she is American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
Besides, many mexico-américains that I know do not have the impression to be part of a country or other.
We love the music of the Mexican group, The Tigers del Norte, but equally the one of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the better one of the two worlds, but we did not root in anything of the two.
To Mexico, one considers us as Americans.
And to the United States, one considers us as Mexican.
And now, to complicate a little more relation, as I learned it during my stay, certain Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want to come close to themselves Diaspora.
They want that the mexico-américains work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, while representing its interests to the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that it is necessary absolutely to visit and to put the pressure to the political leaders to reinforce the links with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That will not arrive.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if one considers salary inequalities, the corruption and the violence linked to the drug that are omnipresent, a lot of did not persuade us that it is a matter of a fantastic country.
You will have to unravel yourself only, amigos.
It is normal.
So certain Mexican are not again ready to forgive the United States of the manner of which they treated Mexico there is a century and half, they have consequently to accept that certain mexico-américains want some for them always manner of which the members of their family were treated there is not so a long time.
Hmmm.
Maybe be us more "Mexican" than I did not think it.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
Stop it it-fire between Israel and the Hamas is again a failure for peace.
It never there will be able to have a durable peace between the Arabs and the Jews to the Middle East?
Another effusion of blood seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While persist the same futile arguments for knowledge that began, tens of buildings were reduced in dust; more than 140 Palestinians, the most of them were civil, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, pulled roquettes of Gassed landed close to Such aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in the middle of the mutation.
The Arabic spring all did to shatter, and that one want it or no, the Palestinians and the Israelis are recovered by this regional upheaval.
Maybe that their fight will intensify itself again a little more.
Nevertheless, there are all the reasons to think that that could help them go out of this mortal dead end.
A war that does not do any loser or no winning one
At first sight, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if stop it it-fire granted November 21 maintains itself, the fight of this week reinforced the favoring force, of the two sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that directs Gassed it since 2007, will boast themselves to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gassed wiped a hiding.
To have killed certain of its leaders and repressed the 1.7 millions of inhabitants of Gassed in the one of the corners more miserable and overcrowded of the planet, Israel did not succeed destroying the Hamas.
In fact, the Hamas wins land on the West Bank, the somewhere else Palestine currently to the hands of their rivals of the Fatah, the other Palestinian faction more moderate.
Of more, the leaders of the Hamas could say themselves that the time is allied them.
The influence of the Islamists of the Arabic world is more and more strong, and the Hamas was done of the rich and friends powerful.
Turkey, an in full expansion regional power, formerly the Moslem ally the closest one of Israel, took does and causes for the Hamas; just as the Qatar, the one of the states more rich and the more dynamics of the Golf.
The members of the Hamas rejoice and say that the Islamist crescent bends itself around Israel, since Lebanon, in the north, where the militia of the Hezbollah exercises his domination, while going through the Syria, where the rebels to Islamist tendency can reverse Bashar El Assad, and to the Jordan, where the allies of the Hamas threaten the king.
And the most important one, on the flank south of Israel, the climbed of the Moslem Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the done more populate and the more exchange of the Arabic countries, changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot that governed the Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to the Hamas.
On the other hand, the Moslem Brothers are cousins of the Hamas, and their leaders themselves put back some more easily to the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, the Hamas can emerge as importance actor that will not be anymore able to be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, the favoring line lasts Israel will pull the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, the Hamas was put back in can.
The system of interception of missiles baptized Iron Dome proved his effectiveness and many missiles of the Hamas were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - during a certain time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews his support indéfectible; and many European countries accused the Hamas to be at the origin of the last wave of violence.
But especially, Israel prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, that totally was unaware of the peace process.
Although the shooting of roquettes of Gassed killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was saved by the suicide attacks, notably thanks to the separation barrier that overlaps into the West Bank, the principal piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish colonies that continue to spread itself despite their illegality in the matter of international right.
Mr. Netanyahu, of which left it Likud merged with a party again more belliciste, the one of the leader Avigdor Lieberman to the approach the election of January 22, has the beautiful party.
Why to pamper these rotten Palestinians while their data a state?
If they directed the West Bank, not would they launch roquettes, as their compatriots did it to Gassed?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and to hit them as soon as they take out the head.
Maybe that the favoring line lasts will take it; but it can himself that the Arabic spring changes the data.
Even if the Islamists that take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to attack itself to the problems in their own countries.
The budget of the defense of Israel is more important than the one of its four Arabic neighbors meet.
Begin a war with local superpower will not help the new Arabic governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain one stop it-fire which is voucher anticipates -- and could mark the something beginning.
The Israelis should equally think about the future.
With the remainder of the Arabic world that becomes more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to the self-determination could create a tinderbox that is devoted to explode a day in the occupied territories by Israel - a little as the bus that exploded to Such aviv this week.
The oppression already weakens the democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arabic population increases.
The bloody missions against Gassed both of them or three years to ring the Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic plan.
The two sides need to be pushed by those of the exterior one.
The response remains the one advocated by the reasonable people that one finds of every side, and by most of the exterior world and by this newspaper: two states, with a territory transfer by Israel in exchange for the security.
A hope, small and in the short one run, is that stop it it-fire will give the occasion to the exterior people to defend this cause.
Egypt, that now must hitch itself to put an end to the weapon circulation towards Gassed, in the same way as Turkey and the Qatar, more better is placed than never to persuade the Hamas to accept the Jewish idea of a state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with exchanges of land and a divided Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the exterior countries should equally do pressure on the Hamas and the Fatah for that they unite themselves.
That would contribute well more to the Palestinian creation of a state than the next suggestion of a pseudo state to the UN.
Mr. Obama has equally any interest to what Israel accepts negotiating.
During his first mandate, it did not present his own peace plan.
Of return to the White House, it seems all so reluctant one to some to establish one.
This is a vision very étriquée.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
That goes through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of neuter cigarettes entered in force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs recover the dark green packages that are all identical ones, whatever the brand
This entered law in force in Australia is a first world-wide one, the logos and the colors were replaced by a green dark olive and of horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and of babies of which the diseases were caused by the tobacco use of their parents.
Outside of the different photos and sanitary warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages.
It is a matter of the system more strict to the world regarding packing of tobacco.
The Australian federal government declared that the objective was to dissuade the young ones to smoke while eliminating any representation glamour.
Studies showed that if the no one did not begin smoking before the age of 26 years, there is 99% of luck that they never begin.
"Even when they are very young, the children understand the message carried by the tobacco manufacturers through their brand picture", declared the federal minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, while quoting studies that revealed for example that the children associated the crown of a logo to a princess."
Even if Australia records the weakest rate of tobacco use to the world and if these changes have only few impact on the profits of the multinational corporations, of other countries envision an analogous gait.
The industry of tobacco did pressure against this law.
The tobacco manufacturers declared that that would restart the commerce of the black market, that will give more easily access to less dear cigarettes.
"Harmful consequences will result from this legislation", declared Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgers of China and of Indonesia will sell well more cigarettes of forgery in the streets of Australia.
Of others declared that this law had revitalized their activity.
Sandra Hectares of Zico Imports Pty Ltd, a small family business, declared that the holster request to cigarettes, notably in silicone to mask the horrible packings, strongly increased two months ago since that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco protested the law and lost in front of the high course of Australia.
Hectares declared that Zico sold 6.000 to wholesalers and is in expectation of renewal of stock.
For us, the matters are good.
The only boredom, say the experts, is the popularity of the social media and the population slice targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws forbidding the advertisings to the TV, the athletic sponsoring and the obligation for the dealers to conceal the cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is at present online available.
Australia forbade the advertising on the Web by the businesses and the local sites, but she cannot prevent the foreign sites of some to do.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you no longer dispose than of a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place essential by excellence", declared Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health to the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase of the contributions of certain citizens lambda in favor of the brands on social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must wonder if it is a matter of a simple citizen that loves the cigarettes Marlboro and that gave itself the penalty to do a video, or if it is a matter of a country marketing orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia declared that the industry concentrates on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry went until to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to protest these new decisions of justice - these countries declared to the WHO that the commerce unfairly is disadvantaged, although none of these countries had important commercial exchanges with Australia.
A decision of the WTO should be taken in the current of the year 2013.
Plibersek declared that the government had held discussions with of other concerning countries of the analogous laws on the packings.
Canada was the first country to render obligatory the warning photos on the packings in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, of which Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.
Harsher laws are currently to the study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos do not disturb me.
I am unaware of them.
"You take a cigarette and you arrange the package", declared Victor El Hage at to buy a package on which figures a photo of tumor of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that will do me to stop, is my granddaughter.
James Yu, managing of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, declared that the uniformity of the packings made the tidying up difficult packages on the displays.
"Before, it is necessary for me an hour to unload a package, now, it is necessary for me four hours" declared Yu.
"The government had only to forbid them a good time for all and we would have said OK, it is good, one stops and one puts the key under the door", it added, while getting up the arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I passed five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, for our airplane had mechanical problems and we had to await the arrival of another airplane.
Consequently, I had sufficiently time to reflect to the theme of boredom.
I will not lie you.
Pass a half-day in an airport to await a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).
But more and more, certain university and specialized experts in the development of the child praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored time in time, they say.
That forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, indeed to nourish creativity.
And as us are, mostly, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the kind deeds of boredom.
Then should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I there will return.
First of all, following the example of a lot of people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, notably since that we have free more time.
But this is not the case, declares Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history to the University of Calgary, to Canada, and author of "Boredom: To Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom dates back to very far", he says.
On the walls of Pompéi figure Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Next, there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it was defined, and debated, of different manners, declared John D. Eastwood, aggregated professor of psychology to the York University in the Ontario, Canada.
After traversing many publications and submitted the idea to a group of discussion of about 100 people, the Professor Eastwood and its colleagues defined the boredom as being an experience that consists "to want to do something, but without succeeding in launch itself in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boredom of the apathy, he says is that the no one is not undertaking a task although she would wish it.
With the apathy, he says, there is not the craving to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, it declared is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a sullen mood and the feeling that the past time slowly."
Boredom strongly can resemble a depression.
But the Professor Eastwood declared that if the two can be secured, the people that bother themselves tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or world, while the depressing people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, it we arrive to think that we are bored while it is a matter in fact of a problem of concentration.
In the framework of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", that was published in the newspaper "Perspectives one Psychological Science" in September, the Professor Eastwood and its colleagues made obvious an older experience in which participating them listened on cassette, the voice of a person in the process of reading a magazine item.
Certain groups heard, in origin of the room side issue, the too high sound of a transmission of TV that had no report, of others have all just one heard the transmission of TV, and the third group not at all has heard the band his.
Those that heard the TV to a weak sonorous level said that they had more bothered themselves than the two others group - they had trouble to concentrate, but knew not why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to concentrate you on a difficult or taking task, an interruption of the attention can drive to boredom, declared Mark J. Fenske, an aggregated professor of neuroscience to the University of Guelph in the Ontario and the one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you carry out a boring task, "as to look at objects on a mounting chain, the music can help you not to bother you."
Indeed, he says, at present, we know that when one twists oneself or that one sketches, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in fact an average voucher to remain physically more agile.
"Studies showed that the children that are authorized to wriggle learn more and keep more information than those that are forced to remain without budging", declared the Professor Fenske.
We are bored all a day or the other - the delay of my flight of airplane, a speaker with a voice monocorde, a particularly boring film.
But certain people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure that, researchers developed a "predisposition Ladder to boredom" in the years 80.
The ladder includes affirmations as, "Among the tasks that I carry out, a lot of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so centers of interest that I do not have the time of all to do."
While using such a ladder, the researchers discovered that the boys tend to be bored more often than the girls, declared Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor to the University of West Florida, and have notably need of numerous and varied stimulations.
But usually, the adolescent ones are quickly unexcited.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development the University of Illinois, took an experience during which it contacted close to 400 adolescent and their parents seven to eight times a day through a beeper.
It raised that 32 percent of the adolescent ones declared being bored to the school and during their duties to the house, while 23 percent declared being bored when they were not at the school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents declared being bored.
The professor Larson declared that it did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, is 21 years later, more students or inferior.
But it added that it knew that "the adolescence is a period where boredom attains his higher level", notably because the children and the adolescent ones do not have a lot of check on what they want to do.
If is I rest my question: boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, for in his extreme form, that can induce the people to take absurd physical risks, to do the Paris or to abuse certain substances to spend the time, as the studies show it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, declared the Professor Vodanovich, that student the problem since more than two decades.
"Boredom is the means that the brain found to make known you that you should do something else", declared Gary Marcus, a psychology professor to the N.Y.U.
But the brain knows not always which is the thing more fitting to do.
If you are bored and that you use this energy to play the guitar and to cook, that will render happy you.
But if you look at the TV, that will render happy you in the short one run, but not in the long term.
Then if your child is bored and that you give him an iPad, it do not s'ennuiera himself more, but it will not have learned to take care all alone or to s'autorégler itself, declares the professor Fenske.
And "this past autorèglement of a position to another", it declares.
Your child learns not only to amuse itself, it obtains more of mastery of itself in of other domains.
I do not think that we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not think not more than we should criticize it.
Feel comfortable outside of constant ferment that generate the activities and the technology is the objective towards which should stretch us.
The professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.
"We need to bother ourselves more often, but boredom awakens a sharp and frantic desire to be connected to something that has direction", it declared.
According to him, what the people look for is a means to disconnect itself and to appreciate the stop times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", it added, "it is difficult to find means to launch itself in something when the noise stops itself."
In the Colorado, no directive for the new law on the marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years, student in a university and soccer player in the Colorado, is charged for something that will become soon legal in his state: the possession of pellets of marijuana and of a used pipe to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco declared that a day, in September, him and some friends were located on board of a car to Lamar, in the middle of the fields, close to the border with the Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to appear for possession of drug and equipment being able to serve to his consumption - offences minors, each being accompanied of a fine of 100 $ - and a date back to appearance.
"We treated as criminals", declared Mr. Orozco.
But in is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of the Colorado to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for his personal usage, the brought response to hundreds of matters implying a weak usage of drugs depends more of the place than of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, that adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences implying the marijuana usage were classified without continuation.
The police force stopped charging with the adults of 21 years and more for possession minor of marijuana, for the law will enter in force into the weeks to come.
But the prosecutors that are located in the more conservative districts of the Colorado called to accelerate the existing matters of marijuana and continue to charge the people that some possess.
Simultaneously, several cities of the suburbs of Denver until the mountains of the West vote currently to prevent the opening of commerces of sale of marijuana accepted by the State in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so quickly that I do not know what we reserve the future", declared Daniel J. Oates, the boss of the police of Aurora, to the east of Denver.
The organisms of regulation of the State of Washington put themselves equally not poorly questions.
They are in directive quest on the manner to install a permit system, authorizing to produce, to make, to distribute and to sell - before the date stop of the 1st December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, that one want it or no, is in advance on most of the states regarding regulation on the marijuana, first of all concerning the usage to therapeutic ends and now in the matter of the personal usage.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and constitutes a good informer", declared Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than to suggest what works.
"There is not preceding reality on which we could base ourselves, it said.
The law of Washington, that is called I-502, takes effect December 6, which leaves a lawful emptiness of a year, during which the system of permit will not exist not yet, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, questions practice remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees a fitting access to the accepted and forbidden marijuana the installation of commerces of sale of marijuana in a ray of 30 km around a school, of a park, of a land of game or of a stays.
"There will be not more difficult places than the urban zones to install an accepted commerce of sale of marijuana, notably in the metropolitan zone of Seattle", declared Well Livingston, a spokesperson of the Center of legalization of the marijuana, a group of recently formed research.
November 21, the boss of the police, Oates, to Aurora, sent an e-mail to its announcing officers that the "City attorney" (representing of the public ministry) no longer would follow the people of 21 years and more that possess small quantities of marijuana, and that the police had to stop charging with the people for this offence type "to immediate effect."
The Boss Oates declared that the police would apply the new decisions of justice that regulate the activity of those that cultivate the marijuana to medical ends, and that it would continue to follow the trafiquants of drug and the drug dealers.
To Weld County, in the north of the Colorado, the "district attorney" (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, it declared that his office would continue to take care of the matters of possession of marijuana, principally in order to do pressure on the users for that they do themselves to detoxify.
At the present time, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less than marijuana, but a lot of them are the object of other indictments.
"Our office has the obligation to file pursuits against these people that committed an offence that, to the era of the facts, was a recognized offence", declared Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places as Mesa County, where the votes rejected the initiative in favor of the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police to Big Junction, the biggest city of the county, no longer does to appear adults for possession of restricted quantities.
The representative of the public ministry of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but equally decided of not to classify without continuation all the matters of detention of marijuana.
"I do not have the impression to waste my time to continue to apply the law until she changes", it declared.
Although 55 percent of the votes of the Colorado supported the measure, offer a lawful and fitting governmental framework the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy thing.
And the contradictory reactions that were observed in different American cities make obvious the deep ambivalence among the official local one in the matter of the legalization of the marijuana.
"It is a matter of a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, declared Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that represents the consumer accused people of marijuana and that expresss itself as local spokesperson of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (national Organization for the reformation of the laws on the marijuana).
"They passed a good party of their life to prosecute people that consumed marijuana, also, they have trouble to accept that it is legal", it declared.
As first states to treat the restricted consumption of marijuana to the same level that the one of alcohol, the Colorado and the state of Washington are on the way to to become a jurisprudence case for the legalization of the drugs.
While the defenders and representatives of the State foresee a new border of legalized sales, they await with worry the directives of the federal government, that always conceives the sale and the marijuana culture as federal crimes.
Defender of them the legalization of the marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite certain publicized arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and of salesmen, the federal government especially allowed the commerces of sale of marijuana to therapeutic ends to exercise in the Colorado, to Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police probably will not sink the doors to seize small sachets of drugs, there is strong to bet that she opposes herself to the accepted commerces of sale of marijuana to personal usages authorized by the new laws, declared Kevin A. Sabet, a former counselor politics of the administration Obama.
Many cities of the Colorado did not await that federal authorities act.
Well before the votes, certain local administrations approved moratoriums concerning the creation of the new commerces of sale of marijuana, even if it is only a continuation of a year.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to rediscover ourselves in a position where a permit is granted to someone and next we to rediscover confronted to a federal problem", declared Bobsled Nicholson, a member of the town council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are very interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the State.
A lot of questions put themselves.
Petronella Wyatt: I was manhandled and exclude from Oxford, for I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only the students of today that are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I always dreamed to enter to the University of Oxford.
My father and my elder brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a sort of Greek amphitheater of the modern times that stimulates the two pillars of the civilization, the free thought and the tolerance.
Nevertheless, two weeks after installing me to Worcester College at the end of the years 80 studying the history, I decided to pack my suitcases, provoking the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The newspaper of THE Standard Evening claimed that I had left this university, for I had objected the Fact that of the students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next door of mine.
The author A. N. Wilson declared with facétie that I had left after forcing drinking in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, for I had been victim of intimidations and is the object of constant bullyings.
Not because of my rather extreme name, or because of the Fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single one and unique reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was victim of a racist and barbaric behavior my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counselor of Margaret Thatcher and I was partisane of the Conservative Party.
Why to evoke that today, you will say me.
And well, recent studies revealed that a new generation of students of upright center undergoes the same type of persecution.
Growing and institutionalized hate of the students Tory to Oxford is such as last week, certain of them demanded a protection of their rights, in the same way as those of the gays, handicapped people and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the room of the students (JCR) Corpus Christi College declared that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university for the equality of luck so that their opinions freely can be expressed.
Their position was not facilitated by the recent broadcast documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and one the Right" ("The country of the wonders: Young, Intelligent and right"), devoted to the political one with the students, and that depicted the "Tories" as eccentric and néonazis.
One there discovered notably the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", that moves itself in rolls-royce, sports a silver-plated suit and moves itself with a cane to chrome-plated head.
In of other universities, the said conservative students to be treated as scapegoats of set it up of the increase of the expenses of schooling."
Luke Black, 20 years, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", declared to a newspaper on Sunday "that there is a growing left bias in the universities.
The people think that we are as the Bullingdon Club without even to have met."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years, student in history to the Corpus Christi, that proposed a proposal for more of protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of the OUCA, says that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR with regard to the people that are upright center.
"That constitutes a hindrance to the liberty of the debate intellectuals, as well as to the well-being of the members", she declared.
I was the only one to think about the sort during my first past weeks to Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and of a paralyzing timidity.
Hate on the part conservative was very virulent.
The preceding year, the university had voted the refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher - a studying old one - an honorary title, because of the reduction of the financing of the superior studies.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
As early as the first days of the week of welcome, when the studying new ones did knowledge with the others and the professors, I had one before taste of what was going to happen afterward.
I discovered that the professors not only participated in the sarcasmes towards the students Tory, but that what's more, did it pleasure.
It was as if the political one on the subject of the minors strikers, privatization and opposition of the government to the penalties against the apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the rooms of class.
The first sarcasme of which I was victim concerned a translation towards the English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I there was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt", said the professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "want to translate the first paragraph"
I lost foot.
Pitt, a small man to the pustular face, took itself easily.
"Do the Thatchéristes refuse to learn the French or are they stupid just?" did it ask.
The studying others laughed.
The tears burned me the eyes.
"I suggest you to take courses of French during your free time - at last, if you did not too occupy to do you the friends", it launched of a tone hargneux.
I returned in my room, inconsolable.
At the time of the dinner tonight there, I sat alone then I felt a light slap on my shoulder.
It was a student in second year of studies of English, named James, that presented itself as member of the OUCA.
"I know that you are", it said, kindly.
I have well fear that it is some thus.
Any suspected person to be a Tory (conservative) is taken for target.
This is already rather hard for me, but they know that your father is close Margaret Thatcher, that will be therefore even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Plowings (Labor).
Later, to the local pub, I have in a cowardly way tried to hide me.
I insisted on the Fact that I was not agreed with all that had said Mrs Thatcher.
This stratagem failed.
A student in first year of philosophy, political and economical sciences, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the Fascist girl of a pork."
You are contaminated.
Of studying others resumed the refrain.
I was perverted, salts.
"How do the Tories love?" asked the one of them.
They hit one another, isn't that right?"
I felt as the homosexual ones before the liberal legislation of the years sixty.
Could I only have taken a normal life to Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people dividing the same points of view only after the grave of the night?
Should I have become Plowing and deny my opinions?
The three years to come were going to resemble a purgatory of ostracisme and of isolation.
The only professor ouvertement Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, that taught in my university.
It was hated not only because it was conservative, but also because it was to counsel in exterior political of Thatcher and the one of the authors of its speeches.
It was almost never there.
It hated this provincial and insignificant place as well as his adhesion to the deterministic Marxist view point of the history.
In 1997, it accepted a post of professor to the university of Bilkent, to Ankara, in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here", said m'a-t-il.
I began doing the shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents to London, finding refuge with my family and of my friends more open city-dwellers of spirit.
I said to my father that I hated Oxford and I explained him why.
It was incredulous.
During its studies to Oxford, in the forties, all the points of political view were accepted.
"But this is the better place to the world", said m'a-t-il pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city to the steeples dreamers.
Even my Communist friends had irreproachable manners.
It had the tears to the eyes.
Leave them a luck.
I am sure that this is to tease you.
That would break me the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance progressively damaged itself.
A friend, equally Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced its convictions.
During a meeting of directed works the following week, when another professor of history suggested the most seriously world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided of some to do as much.
Reddening internally of shame, I admitted to be victim of the washing of brain of my parents and treated them of "crazy old".
The respite was short-lived.
It is my father who sank the last nail of my coffin oxfordien.
To this era, it wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch every week.
My door was locked.
I remained hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my following ones abandoned.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and I took the first train for London.
I never returned.
You can treat me wet hen pleurnicharde.
But no child of 18 years should be such a intimidation victim in a school establishment.
The most tragic one is than it was a matter of Oxford, that not only produced 14 Prime Minister Tory, but profits equally of an unshakeable reputation of equality and of liberty of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance to notoriety"
In the framework of the exposition "Valentino: a Master of the Sewing", inaugurated this week to London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona thyssen-bornemisza and of other customers celebrate Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Élisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the worthy British capital to welcome an exposition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized it at the time of the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Sewing", a prestigious retrospective one that meets more than 130 models of high created sewings for his sewing house during the 50 last years.
"I love this palace", it declared with his inimitable accent Italian.
This exposition is the point of organ of a history of which the only protagonist is "it signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its fine customers.
Valentino always was fascinated by the closed world and from nobility.
In the first room of this exposition, opened until March 3 next one, one rediscovers an impressive number of private letters and of photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, while going through princess Mary chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes its personal memories as the social trophies of his ascension: modest designer of the city of Voghera, to the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
It does not have anything of poorly to like the monarchy.
"At least, they do not crush their cigarette butts of cigarettes on your magnificent rug as do it certain stars of the pop music", declares the baroness Fiona thyssen-bornemisza.
In the years 60 and 70, we lived both of them in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We loved all to be invited in his chalet of Gstaad", explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate girlfriend of beauties of the past time as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance to notoriety.
And even thus, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, carrying a model Valentino
The model Argentina, Valeria Mazza, not not did more forget the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, to Rome, we went to dine to his apartment.
We were about twenty people, among which ones Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", remembers the "top models", that began working with him during the week of the High Sewing to Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass method, for its creations are works of art", she finishes.
Marched of line of nobility
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of divided loves.
It likes the well high people and with the biggest titles and them like it also.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed in a podium glamour of sixty meters of wide one that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must march on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the principal creations of Valentino, as the tailor that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that carried Monica Vitti in "The Notte", Or a coat in wool and fur having belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
Among this model public, one rediscovers names as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Puts Pond of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
A lot of its said customers that the first clothing Valentino are as the first love, "impossible to forget".
I myself in reminder perfectly.
It was a matter of a pants, of a shirt, of a vest "gillette" and of a jacket of the collection fall winter 1971-1972.
"It is a gift that it had done me", declared Naty Abascal, one of the wander around of the designer.
"I prefer it to all the others for his femininity, his big love of the women, and because it sublimates our beauty", adds the former duchess of Feria.
I like a lot the colors that it uses, they are luminous and light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg do not can, she not more, forget the first time that she carried a model Valentino.
When she was adolescent and lived in Italy, she dreamed to have the age and the occasion to carry one of its dresses of evening...
Finally, that was possible at the end of the years 90.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, the prince Edouard of Line.
It was a dress of red evening, with a skirt to flying, a bustier drape and a low-cut one to fall.
"It was a become dream reality", declared the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
"Valentino is fashionable indifferent, it is obsessed by the timeless one", explains the Italian aristocrat that divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Areas.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the dresses of evening of the designer with "the biggest care, because a dress in the evening is not only a dress, she is also the body of the memories as she vehicle".
The "king" method
The big final one exposition of Somerset House is the dress of bride of Mary chantal Miller reach at the time of his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It was necessary four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls thus its dressmakers) to realize this dress in silk ivory with inlayings of appear, twelve sorts of different laces and one leads of four meters and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historic fact of the high sewing of the end of the XXe century, "the return of the customers of the high corporation".
Obsessed during years by the "interpersonal skills" nobility, Valentino is now his better representative.
Cavaliere say Gran Croce (the biggest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander on the order of the Arts and Letters, decorated Legion of Honor, Garavani combines as much as any honors spouse of its customers.
"His refinement, his calm, his cared one for and perfect aspect always jumped me to the eyes", recognizes Arenberg.
The last time that I saw it, it was a months ago to a gala dinner to the Museum of Orsay.
It was sat to the table of the comtesse Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my big girlfriends.
"It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him".
If it is a princess who the says...
The trade more hard of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four Euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health while carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the craggy paths of rock.
There are people for that the work is a hell and of others that work literally in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living while carrying the sulfur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the gas emanating sulphuric of the intestines of the earth solidifies itself to the contact of the air.
After harvesting big rocks of sulfur, that weigh altogether close to 70 kilos, it installs them in two baskets in bamboo that it loads on its shoulders through the craggy paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to ascend this distance, to a tortoise pace, while keeping the balance and measuring their steps in order not to stumble and fall in the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them life, as that arrived to a French tourist that fell mortal in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago.
The minors of Kawah Ijen win 5 pennies of Euro for every kilo of extracted sulfur.
Once in top, it travel a way between the tourists that the photographs as if they were beasts of circus, and carrying painfully the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining corporation installed a little in contrebas to 1.850 meters of altitude.
It is a matter of Candy PT Ngrimbi, a business that exploits the volcano since 1960 and, one can say it, its employees, to that she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 pennies of Euro) a kilo of sulfur.
She sells it next to 10.000 rupees (83 pennies of Euro) to the industry pétrochimique since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetic, of destroys it and serves even to whiten Sugar.
"As transport us about 70 kilos, we win about 46.000 rupees (3,8 Euros) to every trip", we explain Anto, that carries out usually three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and it finishes exhausted, but that allows him to win 138.000 rupees (11,50 Euros) at the end of the day.
Although that appears to be a misery for superhuman such a effort, is the triple one of what it would win in the fields.
"The income of the minors very student here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15.000 rupees (1,20 Euros) a day and where the monthly average salary is of two millions of rupees (167 Euros)", declares the carrier that worked formerly as mason on the tourist island of Bali.
Over there, his salary was of 75.000 rupees (6,20 Euros) a day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned close to his family to Banyuwangi, a town close of the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulfur: "I married a girl of Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought back it to Java for that she converts to the Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gasses.
To 27 years, it passed three of his life to challenge the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur already began to him to let the bill pay although it covers himself the face with a mask and carries special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gasses rejected by the volcano.
It is the price that it must pay to follow his dream.
"I will work again two years, for I want to open a shop or study the Spaniard or the French" it promises in an English more acceptable.
Manhandled by life, this likable young and intelligent one could be tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of that, it does the work of a mule.
It divides a masure of wood insalubre with of other carriers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning for the sulfur does not stop gushing the night, when his characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of obscurity.
Challenging obscurity, Anto descends in the crater while lighting up itself with a small fixed lamp to his helmet, that it bought himself itself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders since the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of the sulfur to save the costs and does not furnish any equipment to the carriers that work to their account and are paid to the weight.
Of more, they do not touch not more one under of the 30.000 rupees (2,50 Euros) of increase by camera, what's more entry of 15.000 rupees (1,20 Euros), that the natural guards of this park bill to the tourists that come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the beasts, not for the humans", protests Madrusin, a stout carrier of 42 years that works to Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since that it left the high school.
Able to carry until 110 kilos, it assures that it will not stop working "as long as it will be able it", for it needs money for student its 3 sons, elderly between 10 and 18 years.
I will not take my retirement, I will die here for the volcano is all my life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke that go out of the volcano, they if are hardened that no one complains about to suffer from the diseases engrave... to which ones add evidently their habitual respiratory problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and the shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
While balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, only can load 50 kilos.
Every day, its companions and extract him 15 tons of sulfur of the volcano, that three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 kilometers of there by a goat path invaded by the bad grasses.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here for the volcano is all my life", asserts Unainik while opening well the mouth, unveiling several lacking teeth.
The oldest child of its five children, 30 years old, works equally as sulfur carrier.
The past time, but the misery perpetuates generation in generation one of the trades more difficult to the world: the one than do the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore research of the babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans throw the responsibility of this absence of children on the career, the anxiety and the cost of the access to the property.
"The population of Singapore must develop".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my spouse and a patriot, let's fill our civic duty and give life!
It can appear unlikely that these words come from an advertising for lozenges to the mint, but despite that, or maybe thanks to that, the video shed itself as a led one of powder on YouTube to Singapore at first of this year.
The words come from a group of rap that uses local references as "will put a polichinelle in the drawer" to mock itself rate of birthrate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of the video, hopes to attract the attention on the problem in a funny way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, declared that it wished to use the strength of the music for that the people fill "to have them national".
She is destined only to the Internet, we have therefore been able to render entertaining it and funny.
It is a matter of the principal problem in this country.
We are the worse ones to the world in the domain of birthrate, thus felt us that it was a theme that we had to approach.
We knew that the government had attempted several things as to launch perfumes to the pheromones or to organize evenings of speed-dating.
A lot of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
We are ourselves therefore says the following thing: what of more creative one to resolve this problem than of some to do a song of rap?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore takes it not as much to the light one.
It spends 1.300 dollars US per year in political to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favor of the marriages and fathers grants until 15.000 dollars by child, lengthens the vacations of maternity and distributes fiscal profits.
But all that had few effects.
Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology of the Southeast of Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social checks.
The rate of birthrate of Singapore, in accordance with his national distribution of population, is situated currently to 1.2 children by woman.
The last time that it was located above 2, considered as the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why therefore the Singaporeans do they have not more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of politics of the marriage and family of the National Division of the Population, asserts that this is had to a "better education" and to "a wider choice of timeliness of career".
"That allowed the people to have access to a wider range of options in terms of objectives of life and of priorities, beyond the marriage and constitution of a family", she explains.
These changes of the social norms contributed to the increase of the number of unmarried ones and to delay the marriage and the births, which has for result a decrease of the rate of birthrate to Singapore.
Meanwhile, a politics of immigration aiming to increase radically the immigration to oppose the decrease of the population created a resentment within the local population.
To Singapore, one finds websites that abounds a scarcely disguised xenophobia in opposition to the new immigrants, in particular towards the Chinese that are accused to pull the salaries towards the bottom and of not to integrate itself.
The increase of the immigration is equally perceived as one of the reasons for which ones left it in place to Singapore knew the last year its worse electoral results since the independence.
Since the elections, they attempted to correct the problem with set it up of quotas and of higher taxes for the foreign workers.
Unhoped for consequences
While the fall of the rate of birthrate has known effects on the economical growth of a country, fiscal income, the sanitary costs and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore has equally unexpected consequences.
The stretched government to avoid the construction many small houses.
For example, that began touching the real estate sector.
The authorities of the urban development began checking the number of small apartments, known under the name of "can to shoes", being able to be to have constructed in determined zones of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale wins a lot of successes.
Nevertheless, authorities are preoccupied by the Fact that they can promote a style of life of unmarried one and discourage the promoters wishing to construct big family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the real estate corporation EL Developers, asserts that its "cans to shoes" sell themselves a lot more quickly than the bigger lodgings.
They are more popular, in the direction where these lodgings construct themselves well more quickly than those of bigger size.
For this reason, this is well more profitable for our funds.
Nevertheless, it admits that the new norms give clearer instructions to the promoters, to that one put beforehand sticks in the wheels if they wished to propose too many small lodgings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
So so is that these new regulations can be a step towards the increase of the rate of national birthrate, while discussing with the Singaporeans that work in the financial neighborhood of the center, it would seem that they will not have a lot of effects.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are dear, just as the education, it is for that that the people puts back it to later", declares a young framework.
The other people can have of the children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have access to my money and of my time", we declare another young of about twenty years.
The men and the women mention their career, the anxiety and the cost of the access to the property and education as the reasons preventing them from have children.
Thus, although the stretched government to convince its citizens to have children, when it is a matter to do the babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves that have the last word.
Which is deprived out line is deprived online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is a matter of the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
Does Qu'est-ce-qui raise private domain for the less than 16 years?
How this definition to apply in daily life and on the social networks?
Does it understand the dangers to which ones it exposes himself while broadcasting on Internet of the events that it would divide certainly not out line?
The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, elderly between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something of very personnel" on the personal plan and "the password and the name of user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I will not unveil my secrets the more personnel in a post", asserts Jorge, ten years, when it tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it possesses an account for two years.
"This are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone", it asserts.
On Belgian francs, I post pictures sympas or games.
I discuss also with my friends.
"I will not divide one of my photos or of someone that would do the fool", he says.
The young boy reconnait that it is poorly to publish obscene photos, of bare people, of crimes or to write humiliating or commentaries violent.
Jorge assures that it knows its 35 friends on Belgian francs as well as its nine subscribing ones on Twitter.
The majority are family.
His mother in left fact, she knows the password of the one of the accounts.
I opened an account Twitter to express me and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if they reply me, I post them simply", it adds.
"The social networks are funny, I can speak with removed parents or with my friends, in a quick way", he says.
It asserts that it would never accept the unknown request of a person.
It not not fact more confidence to someone that would recommend him a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years, is different.
The adolescent one possesses accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, it admits not to know 20 of the registered people on his list of friends.
"That does not worry me because we have something in common, the music for example", it declares.
According to the young boy, no one did him the advances did or do not ask him his address or his telephone number.
"If they put me the pressure or demanded it, I would eliminate them simply of my account", it recognizes.
José subscribed itself to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that one knows today under the name of cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the young boy.
A close one of an of my girlfriends was racketté on a social network.
They threatened it and demanded money.
"It never knew that it was" it assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"It only passed it in private profile".
It explains us next a series of manipulations to configure his account in a sure way.
To the difference of Jorge, this young one would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing positions.
Yes, I would do it if I was upset or irritated.
"Even if I know that this is cyberharcèlement", it asserts.
Questions keys
Marielos Porras, professor of English and dismissed in Education and Apprenticeship, considers that, to orient the children and the adolescent ones, one must understand that the goal of the social networks is to inform.
"The internet has arises as a means to look for the news but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game changed", she mentions.
Porras signals that the academician Marc Prensky, that possesses a master in teaching skills of the university of Yale and author of the book "Native and numerical immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The native numerical one, it is they, the children and the young ones that were born with the technology.
"We, we immigrated them numerical that there must teach them, while we are ourselves in the process of learning", she says.
It adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what it suits or not to divulge, to publish or to say to an age where they do not have necessary maturity to do it".
"We ask them to be equally selective while which imports them the is more to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" she adds.
According to the specialist, the manner more effective to teach the confidentiality to the children and to the adolescent ones is to use questions that do them to reflect.
"To say them of not to do it does not serve to anything", she asserts.
Next, Porras enumerates some examples: there are things that you would not relate to a foreigner, why the do you on the Internet?
Or, that would it please you that they publish a photo of you as the one of a friend that you published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask the other people the permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need knowledge which you do to every instant?
Another not at is all to do them to understand that they must act online as they do it out line.
This are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, each must act with respect, morality and of other principles, that must be similar on the social networks", she asserts.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, college professor, primary teacher and counsel education, declares that it is essential that the parents read conscientiously the conditions of usage of the social networks.
While understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children of the implications of the opening of an account on Internet.

According to Guardia, it is essential to recall to the children that it is not necessary to speak with the foreigners.
The summit of the Unasur finished without the Declaration of Filed being rendered public
LIFE summit presidential of the Union of the South American nations (Unasur) finished today to the Peru without the Declaration of Filed being rendered public, although she was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 mandatory presents.
Efe tried to several returns to attain the signed document at the time of LIFE Meeting Ordinary of the heads of state and of government of the Unasur, but the ministry of the foreign Affairs and the presidency signaled at the start that it would be divulged after the fence of the summit, then asserted that it would be published of a moment to the other on the site Internet of the Peruvian government.
When they were questioned on the text, they signaled that his content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, at the time of brief declarations to the press.
The access of the journalists to the news concerning the summit constantly was limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricts" was broadcasted in the press room.
The few information that circulated between the journalists were the one given by the attached press of certain ones of the governments of the Unasur that attended the appointment, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The unique divulged document at the time of the day was the list of the present presidents, which provoked a certain malaise with the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media claimed from more important the news.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" summit, but it was a matter of the speech of the president Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In last October, Peru was the host of the 3E summit South America Countries Arabic (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although that was asked with instance by the press, it had not broadcasted not more the declaration called equally Declaration of Filed, as that previously had been announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, one can verify that the document was published in the month of last March.
In the two international appointments, Peruvian authorities tried to set up of the sure systems of transmission for all the journalists, but they limited to the maximum the achievement of information.
The summit equally concluded itself with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Course of The Hague that splits a different border one between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the time of the regional appointment and declared that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the pleas of the two parties in the process that Filed filed against Santiago and that begins Monday to The Hague.
"We will respect and will execute the verdict that will resolve the disagreements that we carry today in front of this international course", declared the president Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile always was, and will continue to be a respectful country of the international right, peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international courts", added the president Piñera while giving a hand handful to the president Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would subject to themselves the CIJ took place after the Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which she had accepted subjecting to itself the international decisions of this court, after a decision on maritime limits with the Nicaragua that she considered as gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Moral Evo, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The Paraguay, suspended Unasur since 2011 after the discharge of his former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The president host, Ollanta Humala, in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after noon to Filed.
The mandatory one read the final document in which it announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set up between the South American countries for a total of 17 millions of dollars of investment.
Among the adopted agreements, it mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would set up of the "important gaits to attain the goal of citizenship South American by the development agreed on the certificates of registration".
It informed that of the actions would be set up to improve the "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against the international organized crime, actions for a better accessibility to the medicines, the access to the cheap Internet in the entirety of South America, and to evaluate in a joint way and effective the risks of natural catastrophes".
With an Europe in crisis, "the economical consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphant matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to glimpse a future better for our populations", concluded the president Humala.
"We decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the spaces of South America, in particular in the rural and border zones.. while uniting our country and while generating again economical circuits", declared the Peruvian president at the time of a speech.
Among these projects, it mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of his territory, since the coast to the Brazil, and that two aimed a more important connection with Ecuador although it did not give more ample details.
All the same, the final document mentions the position politics of the Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow his reinstatement within the Union of the South American Nations", of which ones it currently is excluded.
The necessity that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and of peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another approached theme at the time of the summit.
In this direction, the Colombian president, Juan Manual Santos, declared, before beginning the regional appointment, that it hoped to meet his counterpart of the Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday to Mexico to discuss calmly maritime disagreement through of a judgement of the CIJ required by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega", declared the president Santos.
"We will revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with the Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country", it underlined.
"I hope to be able to say to the president Ortega that we will regulate that of the manner the done more civilize and possible respectful", added the president Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday to Mexico where they foresaw to attend the taken strength of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Same manner, in the framework of the summit, the ministers of the Defense of the pad will meet previously to approve the action Plan of the year 2013, that stretched to reinforce the dialog and the consensus in terms of defense in the region.
The Argentina, Bolivia, the Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, the Venezuela, Chile, the Guyane, the Surinam and the Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru assures the pro presidency tempore of the regional pad.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship", declares Rafael Correa.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, asserted today that the common creation of a citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, had to take example on Europe".
The president Correa, that participated in LIFE summit of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), situated to Filed, declared to the television of State, Perished TV, that the Europeans "were themselves entretués at the time of the Second World War" and at the time of other conflicts, "but that they formed now practically a fatherland".
In this direction, it defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member nations of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to succeed in the free circulation of the citizens and workers in any South American country, as it already is the case for the members of the Andean Community, but it still remains of the reactionary domains that we want to do to belong to the passed" it warned.
In addition, the ecuadoran president showed himself in favor of the reconstruction of the Organization of the American States (OEA) with the objective to diminish the influence of the States Anglo-saxons and to take into account the signatories of the pact of San José on the human rights.
Those that reshuffle us the ears never compromise themselves anything, on the other hand, we, the South American, the all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Commission Interaméricaine of the human rights is located to Washington under the financing of the United States", it asserted, while referring to the political refuge granted by the Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that it does not regret his decision, for it does not have betrayed its principles itself, but it has on the contrary respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
It concluded that to the era, "there were founded suspicions according to which these Assange would be extradited towards a world third nation and that his process would not be respected".
Of more, it criticizes Swedish justice that demanded that it submits himself on his territory to a questioning concerning a sexual presumed offence while "the own Swedish legislation allows doing it by videoconference, which could be done since the embassy of the Ecuador to London".
Correa asserted that it existed a risk that mental and physical health of Assange damages itself.
"I did not speak him since that it is located in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had a small lung problem, but nothing of engrave", asserted the ecuadoran president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health damages itself by the fact to be confined in a small space without being able to do exercises to the free air.
"That acts on not health imports that", it concludes.
Correa signals that the refuge solution granted to Assange since the months of June in the ecuadoran embassy of London, that would be the granting of a safe one drives that would allow him to go in Ecuador, is located between the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and it underlines that it had discussions to London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with the human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is located in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities for the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, launched all a series of procedures with different European instances", it mentioned.
And it thinks that "if the Great Britain granted the safe one drives as early as tomorrow, that would finish".
And if Sweden, as the permit completely his legislation, and as her already did it in of other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador to London, or questioned it through Skype tomorrow, the problem would be equally resolved.
Correa profited from it to reaffirm itself as defender of the liberty of the press and it specified that what it did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that nuisent to expression liberty".
"The biggest enemies of the liberty of the press are not the malicious or perverse politicians but the bad journalists to the balance of eagerness, blackmail and extortion", it declared.
Under this angle, it congratulated himself that that is not this kind of journalists "or the bankers or the countries hégémoniques and bourgeois that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than to put forward his reelection, "it would deepen the revolution to follow the way and to trace the good way".
Correa equally supported the decision to maintain the veto on the Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, while arguing that the organism "had to show itself firm and not to tolerate opportunism and the attempts of blow of disguised States", for in reality, "that destroyed the legitimacy of the democracy paraguayenne".
Furthermore, the ecuadoran president considers as "perfectly pertinent" the Colombian desire of his counterpart, Juan Manual Santos, to negotiate with the Nicaragua maritime limits between the two countries by the bias of the judgement of the international Course of The Hague, which will reinforce the maritime sovereignty of the Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgement is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a country centraméricain.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be surpassed by will in advance together.
It is necessary to resolve them in their together to surpass them and to forge ahead.
At the same time, it was said confiding in the good resolution of the litigation concerning the maritime borders that opposes Peru and the Chile within the same court and it asserted that it is "beneficial that Latin America seizes the international instances if the two countries agree to accept a judgement if firm that it is".
In reference to the eventuality of his presentation as candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, regarding to covet a third consecutive mandate, it signaled that it saw this possibility "with a lot of optimisms and of joy, although that is sometimes rather difficult".
Correa assured that, if it lost the primary ones of February 2013, it would withdraw himself public life.
At the personal level, the strength never interested me, but in as unfair positions as the one of Ecuador, this economical social poverty can resolve itself only by the bias of the political strength.
"My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility", it asserted.
If I won, this would be my last presidential mandate and I will withdraw myself next political life.
Let's so never lose, I will do it equally.
"This is my decision", it asserted.
Correa equally referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, to Gauged.
I have just discussed with the Venezuelan vice president Nicolás Maduro and it said me that a medical treatment of routine already was planned and that it awaited the end of the country to return to Gauged.
"That does not mean one relapses of the state of health of the president Chávez", it commented on.
The ecuadoran head of state participated today to Filed to LIFE summit of the heads of state and of government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur) that finished by a call to a better regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and the security.
The deaths linked to the Aids today are had to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed him the result of the test: séropositif.
"It is as if the sky had fallen me on the head", he says while referring itself at the announcement, that the doctor had tried to return "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
It decided to load itself only of his disease and began informing itself to his subject and his determination was such as it has just celebrated his 43E anniversary.
It is, without any doubts, one of the more former patients of the unity of the VIH of the civil hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which it met again in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at first years 90, where there were a lot of doubts, few choice of treatment and more of scars.
Then, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided of him to say good-bye "because it was without voice".
In that time, have the Aids was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
Nevertheless, ignorant their disease, many people arrive again when the virus already caused damages, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of infections opportunistes.
31 years after the appearance of the Aids in the world, in all the cases after the first signaled cases, "the big victory is today that the survival of a patient having begun a treatment to the timely moment and the survival of the population usually is exactly the same", indicated the boss of the unity of the VIH of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information was validated In April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologue and expert in VIH/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that since 2008, the scientists concluded that the Aids no longer was a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and the life quality depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that presented the patients at the diagnosis, with of better perspectives for those not consuming any drugs: until 30 years for a rate of CD4 of 200 and until 50 years for those attaining a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, that means that for someone that would receive a diagnosis VIH positive to 25 years, "as long as there will remain under check, will be able to live without problems until 75 years", explained the questioned scientist.
In order to replace this progress in his context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexican ones is today of 76 years in average.
If it is true that the mortality diminished in a significant way the latter years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deceased people of the continuations of the Aids is passed of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of ONUSIDA), but it is equally true that, since the appearance of the Aids, 60% of the inventoried patients on the basis of national data deceased.
Nothing that to Jalisco, 255 people are dead in 2011, and there were 187 deaths up to May of this year; nevertheless, one assures us that the access to the medicines antirétroviraux is universal since 2005.
Then why y-a-t-il again of the deaths?
I think that the problem does not come from the access to the treatment.
It is as that that I see it, this happened in our hospital.
On the 12 last years at least, we never lacked medicines, the problem is that the patients arrive to very advanced stadiums for they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it to advanced stadiums of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patient ones on ten arrivals while they already present an infection opportuniste, what it is necessary to have a bigger impact on the global mortality is to realize more precocious diagnosis and, for that, it is necessary to propose tests of screening in a massive way, to all the people that the ask".
The specialists and the members of the Counsel of State of prevention of the Aids of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his suggestion, just like the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, that has of the to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, it already was carrier of the Aids and suffered from the sarcome of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is the one of the complications Current.
All changes when you learn that you have the Aids.
Some think that they will die and want nothing to know.
"If I will die, it is more better than I burst myself three times a week", they say, this is not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do the exercise, I take my medicines.
To this day, its parents know only that it suffers from a cancer.
I have a normal life, as does not import that of other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have a sexual life activates, but coresponsable, I pay attention to me and to the other person", relates Fabrizio, that accepted dividing his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those that are afraid today, at the time of the market of the World-wide Day against the Aids.
What they do the test, if they took of the risks, more they will know early if they are séropositifs and better this will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that one can live as everyone, while being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against the Aids in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many ditches between the programs of health and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara that kissed the cause of the VIH.
And the biggest one lies in the prevention.
In all the dedicated places thereto, "one effectively increased the distribution of the preservatives, before one gave us one or two, now one us in data of the packages of hundred, it is very well, but it in results, that today again, certain do not have access to the preservatives", it asserts.
Among the most vulnerable ones to the new infections, one rediscovers the adolescent ones.
The question: "What are you going to do some?", put with sarcasme and value judgements by the social workers, the orientation counselors, the pharmacists and the health professionals, is the question that the adolescent ones do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorientate this inefficient distribution; that the preservatives only are not sold to the counters, but that one finds them in the distributors of the public toilets and in the places that frequent the young ones.
It is not a matter not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not a matter not not more to pay them the girls and the motel, as had replied the governor Emilio González when one had asked him if there would be a distribution of the preservatives within his administration.
"This is not as that that works sexuality, the more better is to furnish preservatives to the already active people sexually", it underlined.
The figures to Jalisco
One inventories 13.435 cases combined (12,158 of the Aids and 1.317 of the VIH).
The state is the 4E State of the country in number of the new cases and combined cases of Aids and 13E for the number of the patients of the VIH.
92% of contaminations do themselves by sexual way, 6% by sanguine way and 2% by perinatal way.
One considers that 50.000 people live with the VIH, since for every recorded case, there is 4 or 5 people that the are unaware of.
A ratified judgement in call by a court of the United States is unaware of the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro consented through a commercial bankruptcy to Mexico. The scenario provokes a preceding harmful one for all the national corporations possessing ramifications in the country neighbors and having problems of creditworthiness.
One would say therefore that the procedures of survival of the corporations authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the banner étoilée, to contrepied of the international agreements.
From the standpoint practices, the carried blow to the returned judgement June 15 last one by the judge Harlin Hauls Course of the bankruptcies for the district north of the Texas, leaves the Mexican corporations without defense facing the possibility of embargo of their property beyond the Cheer.
Nevertheless, the resolution will allow the principal manufacturer of glass of the Mexico to seize the supreme Court of the United States while basing itself on three incoherences.
First, while the judge of the cause signals that the creditors must record themselves according to the law on the bankruptcies of the United States, the court of call of the fifth circuit, sitting to the New Orleans, asserts that the principal procedure is the commercial bankruptcy formalized to Mexico.
The first point would imply to denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the cases of insolvency of businesses having a transnational profile.
Of fact, the law Models United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial Right had been created to this end while taking the American Law Institute as referee.
In second place, the judgement establishes that without the vote intersociétés, recognized in the mass criticizes commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by affiliates of Vitro towards the corporation mother, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
Nevertheless, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
Of fact, the case of Vitro is not the first one to use this plan.
There is here a half a dozen of examples, among which these Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of the Commercial Bankruptcies had guarantees the debts.
In addition, which is some is that, since there remained the votes of the affiliates, of all the manners the creditors of Vitro that fought against that in the courts of the United States, that is to say the funds "vautour" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been of 45 voices against 37.
A data omitted by the call court.
Of another side, Vitro was criticized for the difficult position that it met since 2008 without stopping itself to the engraves economical crisis that confronted the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the moment, the corporation of the family González Sada will lodge call in front of the same court of call for that the vote takes place in his entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
Assurance recourse will claim non-prosperity and demands the revision of the process by a superior instance, in this case the supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The does more engrave is than the court was unaware of a document sharp by the government of the Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Course") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro in the framework of the law on the commercial bankruptcies, while signaling that that liberated it conventions signed by the two countries to put it to the same level that indentation 15 of the law on The bankruptcies of the United States.
Of more, it signals that the country folded itself to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations concerning the International Commerce, that is to say the fixed rules for the cross-border cases of insolvency, that guarantee the equity for the debtors and the creditors.
Pile-up of two parties: they knock senseless Vitro and they knock senseless the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball ball is all my life"
The globe trotter of the basketball ball "Hetin" Reyes passed more than 60 years of his life in relation with the land and, thanks to him, traveled in the entire world.
Few people to Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the basketball ball local as big as the one of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is some that before a cerebral hemorrhage does not condemn it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport during more than 60 years, that that is as player of inferior leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manage and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball ball.
"I carried several caps in the basketball ball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general director of the national team and president of the federation during the years 90", remembers Reyes at the time of a visit of Will Surpass Hora at his place to Bayamón, where it lives with Isabel, his faithful spouse since more than 50 years.
"The basketball ball is all my life".
Reyes exaggerates not when it does this affirmation.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated ones of photos and of memories that recall his itinerary out norms, some testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all its memories, those that it is fond of the are more those that recall him his passage as player within the team of the Vaqueros in the middle of the years 50 until 1982, after passing 15 years as co-manager or managing team.
"That was my better years, the one of which I more took advantage it because I had the luck to participate in eight championships of the Vaqueros from 1967, that this be as to manage, co-manager or leader.
That does a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships of 1971 to 1975.
I next withdrew myself at the time of the championship in 1981, the year where Jerome Mincy entered into the team of the BSN.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, that was a big administrator, took the head of the team", indicates Reyes.
I remind me that Gene Bartow, that had been leader here and that was located to the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said me: "I have a sturdy player for you, it measures two meters.
Do you want it? "?
It is as that that to begin Mincy, one of the better players than had Puerto Rico.
Bartow next recommended me Raymond Mocks, that was naturalizeed and that was one of better marksmen.
I remind me that it said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Mocks was going to help us to try of some to win another.
It is himself rejoices at the championship of the Vaqueros with Mocks, but only from afar since in 1988 it already was the big manitou of the federation.
In that time, it preferred to take advantage of the its loads and of the one of Mincy in the national team.
I remind me when we won it for the first time to the United States at the time of tournament pré-olympique of Mexico in 1989.
Next, there was the World-wide one of 1990, where we arrived 4E and where we should have won the gives an award to bronze if this Canadian judge had not done ourselves to replay the last game, declared Reyes.
The team of the World-wide one of 1990 is she the better national team than you saw?
She is part of the better ones, just as the one that beat the Dream Team at the time of the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite one is the one of the Games Panaméricains of Gauged in 1991, when we won gold and that we put a hiding to the team of the United States, that was rather similar to the one that had won the bronze at the time of the World-wide one.
This team only was not composed from Mincy, Mocks, Ramon Fastened, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there was also the young ones (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Crankcase, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morals, that had not been able to attend the world-wide one of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was not maybe the better one in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gives an award to of now and a big joy at the time of tournament pré-olympique of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the mess of the Games Panaméricains of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the predictions.
Which was the better player of Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it is a matter of Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Person to Puerto Rico dominated to this level as did it Piculín.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which ones it played.
Who was the better leader portoricain?
This is very difficult to say.
We had a good composed team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Moral Carlos, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young ones, I like a lot the work that does Leo Arill.
For you, which is your bigger success within the federation?
To have been part of the era more glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the Fact that at first of the years 1990, the BSN counted until 17 teams in a season.
What you is there remaining to do?
There are things that I would have wanted to set up, as the regionalization of the categories minors.
For example that the boys of Pounce play only in their zone and confront only teams of the other corners of the island at the time of the national play-offs.
Today, the young ones travel and play too while that is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of the obligatory certifications and courses for the leaders, the personnel of land and the referees.
That renders happy me.
What done you today?
Usually, I listen music, I look at pop videos of my era on YouTube, I take advantage of my grandchildren and, of time in time, I attend games of basketball ball.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my spouse, Isabel, that always was at my sides.

"I know what it would be necessary as epitaph for JR", declared Hagman in 1988.
One should write: "Here gît the honest citizen JR. Ewing".
Here the unique party that it lost.
Principal Victoria, coprotagoniste of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as of a man "immense, so on the small screen that in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans through the world, and in the heart of each of us, that had the luck to know it and to like it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Paved" were broadcasted some months ago with a big success on the chain TNT.

A treating course of the "Fine of the world" has just begun
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and the climatic warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmed decided to give a course on the end of the world, it knew that it launched there an irresistible hook: the end of the "big discount" Mayan calendar, December 21, to which one refer themselves many people as being the proof of the end of the imminent world.
But the Charmed professor had no idea of what awaited it during the following months: the disastrous hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gulf that some nicknamed "the Armageddon of the debt" and an implying growing conflict Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times thought that would release itself the apocalypse.
"I did not realize that that was going to be the semester more apocalyptic than I never knew", declared this week the Charmed professor to its students of the University rutgers-camden (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and than we related it, that was a very good period.
And it is necessary to remember that what is bad is good for those that believe the apocalypse.
And it is not the only professor to give current on "the end of the world" this semester, that will be, in theory, the last one of the history.
To Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exempts the course "Media, culture and fine of the world".
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the viruses and the germs and the climatic warming.
"We analyze that for these ideas proliferate with the time", it declared, and the manner in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain driven human one.
If the nuclear armament fell in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could burst.
This months, the students will analyze films having apocalyptic themes and will study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students on what was possible, probable, credible and impossible", declared Vacker.
On the principal campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant teacher of History of the Art and of Anthropology, did team to give a course, simply entitled "The end of the world".
"We add" 2012" to have the possibility to give the course again, in case the world not disparaitrait", declared the professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", the students must study, create projects and pass their final examinations.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be passed the day before Apocalypse, which does not leave to the student of other choice that to work "to the night same of the end of the supposed world", declared Restall.
The courses revealed themselves rather popular.
"It was complete in two hours", asserted Restall about his course intend for the students of high level, composed from 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people that asked if there was again place.
The students, for their party, assure that the course is the one of the most interesting ones.
"That fascinates me to see what the people are able to do to console itself", declares Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of rutgers-camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, that she is secular or religious, is only a question of consolation, or of absence of consolation.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Infirmary of 25 years, asserts to have viewed all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard about a course that taught this matter", it indicated.
I appreciate it.
But none of the questioned students, and again less a professor, did not say us to believe in the date back to end of the world of December 21.
"Our first project treated Mayan prophecy, and of a certain manner we discredited it", declares Julie zegle, student of last year to Temple, 21 years old and native of West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is a matter only of a date key on the calendar, declared Restall.
But I grant that it exists an anxiety linked to the apocalypse in the western culture, dating back to several centuries, that does that the people react to the changes in their environment while predicting the end of the world.
The internet provoked a leap of these speculations.
"In of other places of the globe, the people does not do not think about that", it assures.
It is a matter in majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University The Room that gives courses to the Philippine this year, replied quickly when one asked him if it knew that one gave here courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippine ones do not participate at the end of the world", replied nous-a-t-il, as if it was a matter of a coming exception of a superior authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall points out that with the passing of the years, one talked about the numerous supposed dates of the last judgement, and it asserts that if nothing does not happen December 21, "the people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or to philosophize on the Fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
The students and the professors take the date to the light one.
Several said us that they thought to go to parties "end of the world".
"Sometimes, I call friends and we in laugh together", commented on Samira Ford, student in communications of 20 years.
