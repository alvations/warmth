The republican strategy resistance re-elected obama
Republican leaders justified its policy struggle against spin in the election.
However, in the center of the brennan as the last myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the united states more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
Besides lawyers republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states for ten years.
One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such acts are partly discredited system of american democracy.
Unlike canada american states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the united states.
That's why most state governments since 2009 pass laws that make it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the election in november 2010, which brought the republican-controlled 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result, only for one year 2011 was made 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 state.
The new laws on elections require voters to present photo identification and proof of the american citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolished the right of voter registration in the day will and undercut the right to vote with the citizens, with a previous conviction.
Before the election of 2006, no american state does not oblige voters to present photo identification.
Indiana is the first state, who introduced a similar requirement.
The us supreme court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law adopted in indiana.
The republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and in other states.
In the last two years, they initiated bills that obligate voters to present photo id, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike the quebec american citizens do not have such universal id cards, as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of american citizens, there are 21 million people, reached voting age have no photo id issued by the governmental body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
While the cost of the required id often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income.
In fact, 25% african american, 15% of people earning less than 35 thousand dollars, 18% citizens older than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo id.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from the democrats, in several states were not allowed to use photo identification, issued by their school.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state did not require evidence of the american citizenship for voting.
For the first time a similar requirement was introduced in arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the united states.
These measures, obviously, aimed to restrict voting hispanics.
It is believed that two thirds of hispanic voters votes in favour of the democratic party.
In addition, republican lawmakers launched in 2011 laws, abolished voter registration in the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who want to register.
This restriction has not passed without any consequences.
So, for example, during the election of 2004 campaign for the registration of voters helped to make in the list of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall on 17% level of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, republican legislators passed in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the general election 2008 florida 33% of voters vote ahead of schedule, were african americans, while the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with descending from latin america.
Only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who, forming 76% of voters, among early votes accounted for just 46%.
Of course, laws and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several projects laws was ветировано governor.
The action as ambiguous laws was suspended with the involvement attorney general of the united states.
It allowed partially limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the photo id.
Nevertheless, the new rules in effect, of course, plague the implementation of the electoral law in the election of 2012.
Criticism from democrats denounce contempt laws, which were adopted, seeing the obvious directions to affect the results of the 2012 elections, in key states.
The report of the brennan from 2011 shows that states that have these laws are 171 of 270 votes needed in the electoral college, to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of presidential elections 2012.
Only one thing is certain of these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such acts are partly discredited system of american democracy.
Screening prostate cancer: test or not?
In fact, the test for the dog gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to uselessly medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to light the dispensaries have from what hesitate even more.
Test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the research, conducted in the united states have been observed numerous cases of infection among groups of research, however obtained data are difficult to interpret and it is hard to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time, european found different levels of mortality among those patients who were screened, and those who did not take place at all.
This survey also showed after a 12-year observation that the likelihood of metastasis on 30-40% higher than those who did not pass the screening.
However, i would recommend a test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Black men also are at heightened risk.
The key is a good decision making, as soon as the cancer was detected.
A cancer may be as aggressive and low-level.
Patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer diseases, offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long run, and making the choice in these cases, in favor of active surveillance disease.
Today, many men, who have revealed the cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, as their cancer not aggressive and not a threat to life.
We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we have the exact criteria for deciding who should or should not be the course of treatment.
Thus, i'd recommend still test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not pass this test.
In cooperation with the international association of urology, created мовембер tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons test on the dog.

Prevent a disease
Unfortunately, there is a miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, compliance with a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all great people ate and enough, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented.
``If no one never smoked, this figure would be at least 50%, ''said andré beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain utterly unaccountable.
For the canadian cancer association anti-tobacco movement remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is connected with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It deals a tremendous damage to the health of people.
``Even today in quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers, ''said spokesman andre beaulieu.
Promising fact: ten years after smoking the risk of dying from cancer decreases in half.
Weight
According to the carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
``Research shows that regular physical activity throughout his life protects from colon cancer, ''added to the association.
Food
The association also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risks of colon cancer.
You should also avoid sausages.
Canned meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
``The last may harm the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer, ''explained in the association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have influence vitamin on the development of cancer.
But at this point, the results of these studies is not clear.
According to the scc, research vitamin e give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin d is also no full clarity.
But mr. beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and the family anamnesis it is important to discuss with your doctor.
``Hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer. ''
Higgs boson in detail.
Last summer, the message that scientists, perhaps, managed to discover the higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is considered, that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing so much.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or in any case, ``less imperfect ''descriptions of nature and the behavior of the matter, but which had not been found by experience.
But physicists have still not sure that the question is about бозоне higgs boson.
We know, without any doubt that we deal with a really new particle and that she was reminiscent of the higgs boson predicted the standard model.
In addition, new data presented on this week on a single major physical congress in kyoto, it seems, confirm it, although for a full confidence of some information is not enough.
Imagine what we are talking about бозоне higgs, because the odds of mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means.
There are, in this world one law is inevitable, which said that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
Around this rule there is no way, do not even try too hard, or to harm himself.
But although elementary particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that in her too have one law of similar nature: the principle of exclusion pauli, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space in the same time, if they are in the same ``quantum state ''is`` condition'' is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physics share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find the good citizens, called fermion, who wisely obey the principle of pauli.
In another scurrying around бозоны, mean gang anarchists, which have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can safely be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (incidentally, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory at berkeley, these бозоны section in turn, on the two groups: meson, about which we are here we are not gon na talk, and ``particles of power '', through which the forces of nature and in some kind of higgs boson.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly simply бозону: фотону, or particles of light, ''which is a ``courier'' of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a piece with the electrical charge, or changes direction, this ``violations ''electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone in a pond.
In this ``violations ''born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation or ultrasound, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than photons - and, therefore, one of the bosons`` vectors of power''.
A more stable field
The same happens with the higgs boson, with the only difference that this boson appeared, should be ``violated ''different field, higgs field.
However, the higgs field much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to his institute, need to achieve a very, very high energies, as if it was a frozen pond surface, which could only be shaken by very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as the one that is operated in cern, the large hadron collider, a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! - to achieve such huge energy.
The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the balance between the higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, himself never will stay on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the higgs: those who interact, have mass while others (like the photon, by the way it did not have.
So, what can bring ``all of these studies, asks ms plamondon?
In science, they are used to validate the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find divergence between the results of observations and forecasts.
In addition, some of them passionately eager to this divergence exposed to the discrepancy could open the door for a ``new physics ''and plug some holes model.
Last, needless to say, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms around 80% of the universe (uh-oh!).
But while at cern such conflict is not found.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for everyday life of the average person it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not present.
Watch: in the early 1960s pioneers of the laser research laboratory in bell could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.
In fact, late physicist willard boyle, who has worked in bell laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and he developed the first continuous laser (previous lyrics impulse) in 1962, said that the laser was seen as a ``lab gadget. ''
Imagine...
And in addition, the application may be a tool, accompanying the study.
For example, the same williams boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor light.
This sensor, although it was not his original purpose, now serves as a ``eye ''for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the nobel prize in physics in 2009.
Of course, it does not mean that the work of the large hadron collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that it can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... ``debt ''
In the commission for a decent death in quebec recently discussed a sensitive issue for the rest of his life.
The debate soon to be resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill.
Nevertheless, in this crucial area much remains to be done.
``Debt ''tried to take a closer look.
Only a few weeks ago, mr l. still lived alone in his apartment in monterrey.
Prostate cancer, destroy it from the inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
``I was given five years, i have lived seven, ''he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house palliative care victor in belœil, where arrived on the eve.
``But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare, ''he said.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not to walk into the bathroom and even to eat.
Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agreed to help him to eat.
He lifts, even manages to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead him in the tub.
The courage to common death.
``My greatest desire to treat me from diarrhea, it's humiliating, ''he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this scourge.
``During the life we are taught that a man have to pee standing up, ''said pierre broder, a psychologist at the orphanage in the victor.
Regress to the status of a child - for some unbearable humiliation.
``Everything depends on the person's ability to`` deal with the rebound, ''he said.
So, according to many people who are engaged in palliative care, important events cases and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who act in palliative shelter, victor all ill cancer.
Forecasts shut them for a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not offer more help, called ``curative. ''
Ms. a., 89 years more than he did not want to die ''in the mind from suffocation.''
But the disease has enabled me to know their children.
``I have good kids, ''she adds.
``I do not want anymore in life, ''she says, before authorising put her mask to facilitate breathing.
She still awaits in the coming days last visit his son, recruited from italy.
In an orphanage victor with the help of volunteers provide body care and assistance in nutrition.
This is the palliative care, which remains when nothing more to do.
To make the death of more than comfortable.
In quebec for every 11 700 people are one place in the institutions of palliative care.
It is very small, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
This life continues in the best conditions, which may explain dr. christiane martel is one of the doctors orphanage.
Whether the comfort of physical, emotional or mental.
Dying we will provide gundyaeva wash of brandy or pepsi, depends on what he asks.
Diabetics we no longer make control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer, mr. h., who died today at night.
In the morning of his son finished this beer in feet of the deceased.
``We help relatives, as well as patients, ''said natalie savard, director of patient care.
In an orphanage victor none for a long time.
Near cited as an old man who revels in its last meeting with the family in the yard, is situated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children and resell it to survive.
``In the past six months from three to five beds, are always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years, ''says dr. christiane martel concerns.
53% of patients taken in an orphanage, victor arrive from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.&space;e. to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering of the patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in an orphanage.
And some institutions, such as shelter viktor and society of palliative care at home of a large montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.
This is a large gap in health system of quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care to fear the law legalizing euthanasia and assistance in suicide.
Since october circulates a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, dr. balfour's mother will маунтом and dr. bernard ляпуантом witnesses and about their disagreement with similar initiatives.
According to dr. christiane martel, the health system, quebec insufficient to secure the right to palliative care of high quality before will be allowed to transfer of euthanasia.
Recently, ''she says, ``i saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I am afraid that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hope for survival ellen richard already were minimal, when she stopped grueling chemotherapy.
When i told my oncologist, that i am stopping the treatment, she says to me that he regrets that i am stopping the fight, ''she said.
At the same time, she said that my days are numbered!
An omnipotent care is not present
Dr. martel estimates that 90% of patients who ask about death, the medical staff for what they are not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care makes their pain.
It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the struggle with the pain.
According to elsie monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of a large montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthetic in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping until his death, or from time to time, or are constantly.
One should not pretend that we do not know about these suffering.
It is more and more often, patients that fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: ``i want to die. ''
But it does not necessarily mean ``i want to get a euthanasia, ''it means,`` i want to get easier.''
The creation of this report was made possible by the journalistic grant from the institute of health research canada.
Large-scale scandals with the real estate in quebec
Officials, responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, assemblers of political parties and specialists on the italian mafia day after day tell what they know about a colossal ``system '', fleeing construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
``The industry, ''which is very cost the taxpayer of quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
``I wonder how this system is dispersed after they were put into it all means, joking jacques дюшено, mp and former chief of police montreal. ''
It is thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a by-product of the investigation of misconduct, associated with road contracts in quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, jean charest, agreed very reluctant.
``The report дюшено ''established a direct connection between industry, a secret funding of political parties and corruption.
``From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only the ministry of transport would retain a billion dollars on contracts ''if some withheld their instincts to take share.
The commission charbonneau already shifted two mayors, ''he added, hoping that it will ``open schemes behind individuals.''
Permanent division of the fight against corruption, created in 2011
The case had joined created in 2011 permanent division of the fight against corruption, which entered a vast state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, staff at the special unit molot, that after 2009 made ``wastewater cartel ''montreal, stop overpriced contracts.
In recent weeks, was made a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular frank and forget ришару markota - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
In a queue, gilles vaillancourt, the recently retired from the post of the mayor of laval, the third largest city of the province of quebec.
It is suspected of repeated bribery in the state orders.
In addition, the indictment was charged with several engineers and service of the montreal and construction of italian descent, including tony аккурсо and lino замбито.
The last detonated a bomb, having told the inquest about ``system ''of receiving government contracts.
Within a few years замбито gave 3% of the contracts, in montreal, some kind of an intermediary connected with the mafia, which, in turn, as money party mayor gérald tremblay ``joint montreal. ''
In the 2000s замбито years of сорил money left and right. he listed more than 88,000 canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) various parties province, mainly liberals, then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the liberal party natalie norman.
Sewer contracts, in which altered the cost
In montreal ``system ''corruption worked incredibly well.
Gilles сюрпренан, a former engineer of civil construction, in detail described her before the commission: in the ten years he received from construction companies, gifts and invitations to travel to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, for the matches in hockey and bribes in total on 736 million dollars in exchange for supply contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials, responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that the paw over-billing some medicare for 30-40% with the help of fake add-ons.
Then one organizer from the party mayor, martano dumont, accused mr tremblay in the fact that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, with the party offices of dirty money.
After these revelations mr tremblay resigned in early november, bathed montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal руло was one of the first deputies in montreal, crouching alarm.
Mayor of riviera in the east, she's against 2010 sale of municipal plots purchased for $5 million and resale... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be started, ''she textures speculated to understand the functioning of the system, a swarm of ants to stop ãàíãðåíó and identify those responsible.''
This process is characterized as ``painful, but positive. ''
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but montreal will be necessary to have their own investigation team and an observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we are getting home.
On a regular basis.
Jacques дюшено notes with his hand, that ``officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars, but especially troubling him the role of`` elected officials, who knew about this scheme, ''but not participating in the con.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in quebec reaches 70%, he joked: ``i said it was only a pale reflection of reality. ''
The government of quebec offers limit to $100 donation parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: ``while we will not strictly limit elective expenses in politics are dirty money. ''
It requires a complete overhaul of the system for provision of public contracts and financing parties: ``we can not sink below; boldly carefully in the essence of things, we can build a house on a good foundation, with the best control and the rule of law. ''
If this story and casts a shadow over its international image of quebec and montreal, mr дюшено calls on those who laughs, to glance in own backyard.
``Psg is not fc barcelona! ''
In this season in paris st germain achieved extraordinary breadth.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but it can - and a new dimension of the paris st germain.
Profits of great players.
Beside them i am growing every day.
Technical personnel have brought.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But i do not disintegrated.
From the very beginning in the center of the preliminary preparation in ниф in clairfontaine and till i came in as saint-étienne i always strode forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, established by carlo ancelotti.
Completion of this summer is not new in matches to play a very high level.
They also knows that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player, as i am eager to be at the level and giving to the maximum.
In addition, carlo ancelotti has supported in my positioning.
Supported by his deputy, such as claude makélélé, who played in the same position, that i have.
Ancelotti - on the grill?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect for the technical staff.
Today in the first league does not equal and he is the best trainers in europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles in paris.
In january, i have with him was encouraging conversation.
Then i moved from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he has, i also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the season psg?
In the first league lyon took we got a leader.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is champions league: we effectively qualify in one eighth in the finals.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to pass as far as possible.
Now all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good european teams.
First we want to finish first in our group, before porto to have the opportunity to take the return match in one in eight matches.
Whether psg to become the first european club in the short term?
He already has a budget.
In order to become a major european club of paris, it is necessary to win titles and cement the position of a long-term perspective.
Today it's not so.
Financially at psg have the resources to do this project effective.
Do not take the title in the first league, as in the past season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a huge disappointment.
In this year we fervently wish to get this title.
Last season we were this close.
In may, it was disappointed, because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies a champion.
But the other team, montpellier, played a fantastic season.
In this year, i think it will be fine.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title entered such strong team like marcel, lyon and bordeaux, i think that we have the strength to win.
You do not think that the media are too much from paris st germain?
It's okay, that we are expected to make a lot, considering how much was invested and what we have players.
We are fully prepared for it.
On the other hand, when we are home win 4-0 against troyes and we find to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what primarily expect us to people.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We do not fc barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the champions league, that we can answer the challenges.
Look at manchester united, which already has two seasons, failing to pass in one eighth finals, although they have spent a lot of money!
Given the invested sum, we represent you in 15 points ahead already for the winter months.
It would be a disdain for our opponents and the championship in france.
Lyon and marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were ``awakening ''in this new psg.
This shows how entertaining first league.
I hope that in may, we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
Paris st germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the feats of zlatan ibrahimovic.
Well, if they say that there is a ``zlatan. ''
It only means that ibrahimovic very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this purpose, and he proves that he was a star of the first league.
Everywhere, where he played, he indicated that he was a great player and a star of a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person as a player.
He also respects people who surround him.
What he did, it's really only.
It stimulates and other to improve their game.
Thiago silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all move forward.
As you survived the euro-2012 with french national team?
As a disappointment.
I earnestly wished to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a little playing time.
I saw there many things, and i came out stronger.
Today i manage to play good qualifier matches.
That's what i hoped for from the moment of my baptism in blue.
We have learned some lessons from what happened in ukraine, and now have to behave samples.
What do you think about the first months of didier дешама led by blue?
They are for him.
He has a good position in the world cup for the world cup.
He's tough coach, he is close with the players and inspires us to victory.
What was laurent blanc.
But i would not want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that didier deschamps will lead blue in brazil.
A deserved draw (1-1), pulled on october 16 in spain - this is a fundamental match?
This match gave us the belief in themselves.
Every fought for everyone.
Before this shock in spain, in my career did not have such matches.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with the bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current currency exchange, which is based on the center, numbered transactions between recipient c commission fees on their processing.
In addition, as it often happens with these technologies, obvious political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin, invented satoshi nakamora. (a pseudonym), at the same time is the virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...), and secure protocols by the type of bittorrent, which allows the file sharing between the members of the same level.
About 200 000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
A few thousand sites take биткойны for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
Course биткойна, reaching high at $30 (23 euros) in june 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning today by approximately ten dollars (courses indicated on the website bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the european central bank (ecb) in his report about virtual currency, published in october, interested in this system.
He describes биткойн as ``the most successful virtual currency '',`` competition with dollars or euros'' and ``similar to the common currency. ''
Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currency, as ``credits ''for the promotion in a video game, which is made during the game, or who can buy (and sometimes exchange).
The social network facebook has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations always controls and processes any central authority.
In all nodes биткойн networks are simultaneously holders ledgering, auditors, issuers, buyers and sellers.
How this network?
Each deal between the two users actually occurs between two emails, like email.
Only for each new payment, the user can select a different address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction, email signature, using encryption with dual.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, you may check that биткойны used in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book, sent along the entire network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks, sent computers, decided that, like a temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the phase of hashing file, i.&space;e. transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take ``a new transaction and add to her room, before ''is`` all together.
The goal is to find a number that offers a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily verify that it correctly.
The transaction is thus effectively нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.
If to cheat the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) might wish to pay twice by the same money, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, the reward regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation however limited 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred, which leaves another reserve.
Complexity of the problem also increases with computing power.
Life network has already experienced the ups and downs.
Sites that provide services of bitcoin, assault and биткойны were stolen from reserves.
``Defect does not concern the protocol, ''said pierre нуаза, which recently launched paymium - the company of payments in real money using the online bitcoin.
The ecb also reported about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also possess this deficiency.
The big players, such as wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blog software wordpress, their permission.
Recently, adi shamir and dorit ron from the weizmann institute in israel, analyzed the ledger and found that nearly 80% of биткойнов are not in the back.
``Giant sell-off ''were announced in november.
``Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged, ''glad jon холмквист working in coinabul engaged in convertibles биткойнов into gold.
Pierre нуаза, another author of books and manuals for this currency, a firm believer in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
His system paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or infinite payment via a mobile phone, but she uses to verify bitcoin transactions, which thus goes cheaper.
The owner of better control of your personal information and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new hardware or software.
It is enough to inform the address that you can photograph and recognize the phone, pierre нуаза, assurance that he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend revision of hierarchical systems in favor of more horizon.
``Before the bitcoin settles itself, it'll be a while, but 2013 can become a turning point, ''he predicts.
The ecb in his report suggests, incidentally, to reconsider a variety of risks, regarded today, in the case of the success of this system.
We were to withdraw from afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have fled their responsibility in afghanistan (kapisa province and суроби).
Nato and americans must follow in the end of 2014.
For the afghan army is the time to regain control of its territory, and for afghans to choose their future, without relying only on us.
From us suffered in the afghan peasants, which we considered as terrorists.
And we will, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and disabled.
The taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, as it happened in the ussr.
They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even to piedmont jihadists, pakistanis, arabs, uzbekistan, tajikistan.
Them suffer, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will be no more, as soon as the west to behave more delicate.
Withdrawal of french troops from the base ниджраб, which i watched from a height of rolling hills and almond trees planted by the french credit, was held in the right.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 invasion of the taliban on kabul will not be.
Circumstances have changed since their voracious promotion from 1994 to 1996.
While the kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the nation then be perceived as a kind of the release of a return to the security.
Afghan women paid for obscurantism of these peasants, in which they exceeded the al qaeda, but their position has not improved, and in our time.
Former mujahideen, the afghan government and the taliban are united in his desire to keep women in subordinate position.
The main characters anti-soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become hustlers, exciting public land to resell them under construction immigrants, returning from iran and pakistan, using huge american contracts subcontractors.
They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even themselves have not fought.
People, as i heard in the countryside, want the government, which would not be from the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who managed to american generosity: capital outflows substantial.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in iran or pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in kabul are now 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the towns filled as boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to go back to obscurantism of old parties, or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and which look everywhere.
Currently, the army.
The authorities, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, overland ways anti-soviet struggle, already taking measures for the restoration of provincial squad, which would not obey the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain degree of decentralization, on the model of western countries, but the united states wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution of 1964.
President karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the election, stated in april 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not put on your feet, none of the dam is not functioning, none of the irrigation system does not repaired.
All imports; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country blighted thirty years war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
It was rumoured that afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
It only strengthened the feeling that western countries were there, only to them.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, no mining.
The chinese almost left copper deposit айнак months, leaving international archaeologists (financial world bank) dig into a huge buddhist complex and remain the most large employers province.
Also requires that one day is equally afghanistan and pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The french combat units ended 20 november.
A new agreement of the traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, the faculty of the french language in the university, french institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in a bid to win the ``hearts and minds ''and do the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the`` military activities'' at the ministry of defence (cimic), was abolished in 2012, together with a small french society organization, contributed to the numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of the mountain villages.
These works, with an intense involvement of local labor, could help stem the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, protection of soil and an increase in the square of arable land.
That we will leave the memory about yourself, spending two billion euros on military spending?
Much more modest budget has promoted to improve living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural work, emanating from local communities in kapisa.
In order to get rid of the uprising, led by foreign groups that wish to farmers, as they told me, you need to give them a small military support, which would be good control and came to him directly.
Heavy birth of the constitution of egypt
This is a risky move president mohammed morsi.
While egypt divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him with emergency-style powers, he decided to play all-in.
Catching everyone by surprise, he announced wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state assembly two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as egypt is based on preliminary text, in which several times amendment, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only reinforced the dissolution of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his ``undeniably delirium ''continues to`` violate this word'' and ``trample on the right. ''
In the camp of his followers are convinced that it's a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain the text, article after article.
For the president is also a way to restore the society and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed морси, it seems, is convinced that the egyptians to vote positively, as he declared in an interview to the american weekly time.
Moreover, that the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the egyptian people: ``or you vote for my text, or i will keep emergency powers '', which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals not responded to the challenge.
In the middle of november, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they hit the door, feeling unable to convey your opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same thing.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences day emerged around the time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that the constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text, which went on yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of national attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical article from the constitution of 1971, purveyed that ``the principles of sharia are the main source of law. ''
Salafi party, which is the introduction of islamic law is one of the major requirements, hoped to replace the ``principles ''on`` rules'', which would allow them more strict application.
For islamists, the fact that this article has not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the egyptian society.
``Hypocrisy, ''the liberals who see it only as pr.
Because they believe the islamization of the constitution passes through other articles.
They point in particular article 220, which grants al-azhar university advisory role, in particular with regard to verify compliance with sharia law.
According to a specialist in egypt sophie pommiers, this alarms, because ``people are designed to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. ''
We can see the emergence of a theocracy. ''
Many liberals, in addition, excited by the fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
``There are currently no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.
Most lawyers who worked on this text is not religious, and people with university education, some were trained in the french system ''- comforting alexis блое, which is preparing a thesis on egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that ``around article 220 may arise ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular ``fiqh ''[islamic jurisprudence is red.
And in the future may wonder how civilian judges are competent to decide about it. ''
In addition to their religious aspect, text approved yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.
The muslim brotherhood claim that they have declined substantially compared with what were under the old regime.
Another controversial moment: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be in parliament, and in the national council defense.
Also not barred from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite appeals to associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern over the text, which they claim to be devastating for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now prohibited insult, which could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
In addition, none of the articles are not talking about the protection of women, emphasizes хеба мораеф from human rights watch.
She said that the only positive moment is prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word which does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the egyptian president was going to last night on television and protests are planned today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, marching in saturday.

``The great and powerful ''to moscow lift: migrants will save money on language
While the deputies and human rights defenders argue that will give the law on mandatory language testing, in the country have already appeared crooks, trade ``fake ''certificates
Every year to moscow, st petersburg and other cities of russia come 13 million migrant workers.
The most part are the citizens of the central asia: uzbekistan, tajikistan, turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families at home.
Since december 1, has entered into force of law, according to which every migrant would have to take the exam on knowledge of the russian language.
Until this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and retail trade.
However, over time, ''promised in the federal migration service,'' tests will be obligatory for all visitors.
While the exam will not only language, but also the history of russian and basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to obtain, and for the extension of work permits.
An exception is valid only for the citizens of the countries where russian is the state language.
Do not fall under the law and the people who have obtained certificates and diplomas about education before the collapse of the ussr in 1991.
The benefits are doomed and protection of human rights
A network of examination points will work under the auspices of the institute of the russian language the pushkin, peoples friendship university, moscow state university, saint-petersburg state university and other russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in russia opened more than 160 such centres.
The initiative on the introduction of a testing supported and the state duma deputies, and the fms.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times raised in the press question: what is, in fact, will give?
What will change the indispensable knowledge of the language and for the russians, and for the visitors?
Above all, a responsible representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people suffering from ``labor slavery ''.
Very many people say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the fms of russia in tajikistan victor себелев.
Protection of their rights should start to their departure.
The only system organization set allows for 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise from migrants without occupation, education, not knowing language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, ''he said себелев, is a future migrant doomed to face unfair people under the guise of assistance to put him ``are'' in a terribly close barack, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, giving 12 to 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
``At home they promise one thing, and on arrival they deceive, select the passport, are not paid a salary, ''confirms the head of the main department of labour migration ms tajikistan толиб sharipov.
Do not swear, the насяльника!
Nevertheless, many citizens of central asian republics, those who assemble to work in russia, admit that they do not know the language of a country in which seek to, but also own writes with difficulty.
Of course, it's not so much on their fault, how much trouble: few turkmen, uzbekistan, tajikistan can afford to get even usefully primary education.
Because their families can not even feed children, not to mention to tame them wear, wear and equipment in school.
Graduate to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of language, they confess.
``You feel humiliated and inadequate. ''
However, in respect of the law on language for human rights defenders note this is an important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status is not present, there will be no exam, nor the last official work.
Meanwhile, a big part of migrant workers still reside in russia illegally.
``Welcome, or no trespassing ''
Many visitors claim that receive an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And that's a fake registration can be done quickly and for only $1500.
Employees of the russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
``Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea, ''shared with journalists a citizen of tajikistan umed хушкадамов.
``Come on, do not be stingy, buy painting
In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that fakes are not only migrants' documents for registration.
A few ``sham ''certificates of completion of a linguistic tests have already seized by the fms.
Fake paper printed on the usual color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for nothing: each of migrants надеявшихся thus facilitate that passing tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
It's more than two times the price of the official test: it will cost labor migrants in three thousand.
In the fact that the main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption to ``brown ''was not just buy, meet and state officials, and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the government may promise guest workers, not managed to successfully pass testing with the first time, the time to examine basic language courses.
In addition, the newcomers, do not have knowledge of the russian, will be offered a job in the sphere, do not involve active communication with people.
The interior ministry does not take into the turnover of illegal weapons market
The share of crimes with the use of legal weapons extremely small
The ministry of interior of russia offers to tighten the law against the owners of civil weapons.
It's a reaction to the government in the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when no victims, and massacred moscow lawyer dmitry vinogradov, which has resulted in the press were killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of the injury in public places and raise the age, with which you can obtain a license on weapons - since the age of 18 to 21 years.
The idea supported the head of the duma committee on security and against corruption irina yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law of the weapons will contribute to the state duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the russian authorities are trying to fight with the problem by ``tightening the screws ''.
In the network has an open letter, the authors of which are representatives of different public rifle organizations - demand to reject ``senseless tightening. ''
The percentage of muggings with registered weapons minimal, said russian service bbc legal counsel vasyl foresters.
According to statistics of the interior ministry for six months of 2012 142 crimes committed with the use of firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while only in the same period of the recorded 1423 thousand crimes.
The authors of an open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons not puts the offender to go on ``black ''market.
Now, they say, in moscow, you can find any weapons on the low price.
Meanwhile, in the interior ministry argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
``The black market weapons restocked on several channels.
The main such channels of five, says a retired colonel victor huperzia, ten years in the structure of the ministry of education and military headquarters.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first army or military footprint weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the caucasus.
``The weapons was dragged and russian officers, and the caucasus, ''says huperzia.
The following form of ``black weapons ''- stolen criminals among the representatives of the security forces.
Huperzia explains that this includes gone with police warehouses, and stolen directly to law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns ``go on sale with military warehouses.
In many military warehouses often had the bombings.
``There's a proven version that part of the burnings were made to cover the difference, ''said the former military.
His contribution, according to baranec, making the manufacturers of weapons.
``Now breed private gun plants that can not withstand competition on the international market and thrown weapons from the floor at the black market, including moscow, ''said the expert.
Another source of the ``black ''market - contract.
Especially comes a lot of guns and rifles from poor countries, for example, the kyrgyz republic.
``There's its production, sometimes shrubs, education and mafia, who organized the flow, ''explains muhina.
Where a gun?
Experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on ``black ''market.
The report about this in 2011, prepared a center analysis and state projects.
Experts analyzed the statements of the interior ministry and the rosstat, criminal literature and open data portals on the armory.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there ``through the fault of the officials, whose job is connected with the weapon, ''the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of cases of weapons from places of armed conflicts, at 14% cases occur theft at the stage production of weapons, 5 percent of the ``black archaeology ''.
Sales of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to call his name, insists that weapons found black digger, a longtime nobody buys - too yesterday.
Often, as he says, for the new party sellers for military warehouses.
Through the same man buys unit, for example a tt.
He is discharged her pass through the makeshift fence.
``He carries it in the city and sells to 900 euros apiece with two shops, ''he says
``The truth, the police in the course of all cases, however periodically when burning plan for solving crimes, conducting secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons, ''adds a consultant.
``As a luxury shops. ''
The seller and buyer often find each other through a friend.
I looked on websites, blogs, not yet responded comrade, who offered to arrive at the platform 'racing ''where there is a man who drive off with me in a ``corner'', where we will bargain.
The price of the trunk i learned only there.
Military observer victor huperzia
To get a gun i need a friend of mine, which has an exit, ''says sales. - i have so familiar, but i am not sure.
Sellers in the markets, but there either need to come, ''from ivan ivanovich, who asked to convey that she is a daughter of a tooth fell.''
I am now even a couple of knuckles getting through the individual, in which i am sure.
He also supplies them only for me, because she knows that i was not giving up.
The pledges are looking for weapons in different ways.
A former military victor huperzia tried myself in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, while preparing to publish an article about this.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He gave the album with photos, where it was ``anything ''.
``I felt like in a luxurious shop, ''recalls military.
The buyer, according to baranec, do not offer a cat in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we are going with the seller in the forest, there set a target.
``I give the opportunity to shoot, and when i am convinced that the weapon is okay, we are going to bargain, ''describes the procedure of expert.

The search engines on the internet exclude on sites and the group as ``vkontakte '', which offer to buy weapons for different purposes.''
It does not need any documents and personal meetings.
``It is enough to have a certain amount of money, ''they write in the advertising cap on the site to buy a gun battle or automatically.''
The users leave their applications and ask questions.

I have heard of such schemes: usually site registered outside the actions of the russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer via atm pays the invoice.
``In response, send photos and instructions, where hidden weapons, ''said a spokesman for the public organization`` right to bear arms,'' says dmitri kislov.
Victor huperzia argues that leaving the application online, you can stay without weapons and to go to jail.

According to official statistics agency, compared with january and october 2011 the number of such crimes in the whole of russia has decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousands, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased to 7.8%.
In the united states on fast food and supermarket
Through the work on a cashier at mcdonald's goes up to a quarter of all american teenagers
In recent days in america wave of protests against low salaries at the corporation walmart and popular restaurants networks of fast food, such as at mcdonald's, burger king, ''``taco bell,'' уэндис ''and`` kentucky kfc.''
While no one undertakes to predict, will become whether this surge in the ninth wave or it is destined breathed in the early stages.
Shares support unions and a number of the left of public organizations.
Apart from raising modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of walmart and system of fast food, the organizers of protests in a creation of trade union organizations.
Until this sector of economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
Shares began last week after thanksgiving, in the so-called ``black friday '', when america has had an orgy of cheap sales, millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by a.
In this day, some employees of walmart, in which around the world employs 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle incomes.
Walmart sells everything from the cradle, shotguns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores at an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
However many underpaid employees of walmart come only at their work.
Availability and goods made walmart, one of the largest corporate america.
According to critics, walmart can afford to sell the goods off on the cheap partly because few pays its employees.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, for example, on the shortage of trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants of the shares in the ``black friday ''required to increase wages and lamented the fact that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to $100 a month.
The average worker walmart, which of 9.5 dollars per hour, this consumption can not afford, they said.
Researchers at the university of california at berkeley argue that if walmart increases среднуюю wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If walmart, entirely shift wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store will cost them only on 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of walmart quite note that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not inflict corporation nor малейщего damage.
``Black friday ''continued in its stores with 8 p.&space;m. on thursday before midnight on the next day, and during that time walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its cash registers produced in the ``black friday ''almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the corporation dan фогелман argued in an interview with the left site yesterday that jobs left a total of ``less than five employees of walmart, and that the protest was simply`` deadline-driven public-relations gimmick ''of its trade union.
``Free banking! ''
Protests continued on this week in new york, where they were not walmart stores (in this progressive city do not like, and therefore them here yet), and ``mcdonald'ses ''and other cheap restaurants.
Mcdonald's says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you the hospital and will not pay you for an honest job!
Jumeirah williams, a member of the new york city council
At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and new york law, is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants with time, increasing it, but not much, and their average rank-and-file workers receive in new york $8.90 per hour.
Less than them in this expensive city not earns no one.
As you can exist in new york for the money for me insane.
Once through ``mcdonald'ses ''was almost a quarter of american teenagers, who volunteers for their position after school at the same time with their parents.
Few people saw it in this primary source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now i am constantly in an interview with workers, ''mcdonald, who have complained that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed on her children.
On the other hand, at the forum in the wall street journal hangs a comment, the author which notes that irresponsible kids, if you do not know what you will be fed.
The participants of the protests that began at 6:30 a.&space;m. on thursday of mcdonald's for the 40th street and madison, demanded that cashiers and cook system of fast food began to pay at least $15 per hour, there are more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the sphere of fast food were created by trade union organizations.
American law prohibits administration that prevent and punish trade unionists picky and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives.
But it is difficult to reach the union fast food and objective reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover.
The dissenters
Noisy protests took place in this day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in manhattan.
The culmination of the action appeared in the middle of the day rally of mcdonald's near times square, which was attended by several local politicians, in particular, a member of the city council jumeirah williams, who said: ``mcdonald's ''says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you the hospital and will not pay you for an honest job!''.
Demonstrators support and other prominent new york democrats, for example, the candidate of the city mayor bill de бласио, declaring that ``we must join together in support of the workers of fast food so that they have achieved fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new yorker! ''.
As described on the new york times, it was the largest share of its kind in american history of fast food.
But in her participated only a few hundred people, though not all of them were workers rapid catering, in which the new york employs tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether that spark of the flame will generate a mass movement.
``As long as it turns out to deceive brain medium
Popular among fans of modern technologies of the augmented reality in the last time to perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First of the summer for their annual conference functioning model showed google, and then in november, it became known that the application for patent filed and microsoft.
However, from the conversation with the head of the group of interactive using 3-d technologies in cambridge laboratory microsoft шарамом изади for scientists to this company glasses - in the past.
Their nod prospect manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, to create a virtual open spaces.
``Tell me please, in general terms, than doing your research group?
``We are engaged in human interaction with the machines, but at the same time, trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in a mass stuck on stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes often banal in them with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years and predict drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, xbox kinect sensors and is a step forward, and almost no xbox today without the kinect is not for sale, because all interesting gestures management.
- What else we ahead?
``Despite the fact that kinect underwent interaction on the physical layer, much still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3d.
The introduction of the data has improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very.
We are trying to change it, working on a true 3d systems display on the basis of different technologies, including project.
We need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more palpable.
For this, however, need to recognize not only user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
``What do you think about voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her?
It is definitely not a panacea - the question arises privacy, because i do not always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in your niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places we had in the project we thought over gestures, but not over sweeping, and over such, these short.
The gestures were not camera devices and handcuffs bracelet, which enshrines a movement of bones and muscles.
While he's a big, but it can theoretically be to reduce the size of the wrist watches.
But even the future for the hybrid type of control, for example, the жест+голос.
``It's like?
- For example, as you ask me to tell you that can of soda?
You say and show at the same time.
``I usually just say.
``Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
``I mean you want to force the users adapt to what may or may not be at this time machine?
``It's not necessary, but that mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we basically have to work on developing new types of sensors that allow accurately determine human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution depth, it is very important.
``If you are talking about your work with sensors xbox kinect, which you have a claim to modern cameras?
Do not have permission, depth or something?
In principle, the current generation - that's what i can make a start in our work over a three dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 building.
But it's not in the megapixel, and as a matrix and depth.
With the last point of view of all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work algorithm design.
So we need to remember not only about the resolution on axes x and y and z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The person is dynamic, and the current 30 building frankly is not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen бетишес from our redmond lab did the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between people and machines.
I would be in my work is very useful for the equivalent of such a device, not requiring touch to frames per second lots.
- And the number of cameras do not need to increase?
In the kinect now have three cameras, one of which was actually infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected the signal.
And that's already the third camera - is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range.
She does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem.
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue kinect, play with curved location cameras and see how it will help in 3-d definition provisions.
``As far as i remember, microsoft, unlike google, not presented a public your glasses.
You do not think that from the point of view of the everyday use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platform?
``Of course, all the time on the road, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but that's what i think: the best option would be`` transition ''augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection screen and on everywhere.
Points is a very personal device, in this their strength (privatization things only see you), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis points will not allow you to work on virtual objects with other people.
- For a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air available not only to tony старку from ``iron man '', but also an ordinary mortal.
There is a problem, which often show critics of this idea: no tactile feedback!
Hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group prepares to this challenge?
In his lectures i often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well become a supplement of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a background for the image.
It's great to register pushing!
But there is a technology, which is aimed at giving this ``pictures in the air ''tangible - for example, several ultraviolet rays in a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but until it is very weak - as if you came on the pad.
There are also the bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction.
``And you are trying to fool the brain?
To make him think that he feels that sort of should feel at the moment when he sees something?
``That's a good idea, we have not tried to do.
Here is another task on which to fight for a long time - how to make a person, physically located in a very limited space to believe that he is an almost infinite - working over the concepts of jogging (not such as in the clubs), moving platforms as well as huge balls.
Bye to deceive the brain at medium, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on a virtual reality so attractive for research - many things in its infancy.
Taste instead of culture - rosbalt. ru
Rosbalt continues the project ``petersburg avant-garde '', dedicated to the townspeople, which are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art.
In this topspin got bright figures scene in st. petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in europe, bypassing the all-russia fame.
New hero rosbalt - epatage artist kirill miller.
The whole town knows kirill miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, which meets the russian museum, summer garden, the fashion crowd and back.
Picture kirill miller always collect the crowd, where they would not.
Kirill miller is one of the purely petersburg social fabulous developers of new mythologies.
Kirill miller is a brilliant man st. petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he's a man of the city, its appearance in the streets calling smile for citizens to rise the mood.
He recently took in the hands of the future and became a st. petersburg sharmanka as ripe for this complex role of all the bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
 - Kirill, why are you still go through the city in the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
 ``I chose the color red as model, appearance and image.
In this world red - it's a compromise between artist and image-maker for society.
Although the society all bit not gray, causes aggression and exhilarating malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative stock - an invitation to debate.
 ``And when you realized that i had to be an artist?
 ``At the exhibition in the dk nevsky, which were exposed to my work.
I realized that it was my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and new, free like me lyrics are unclear.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with postwarranty, which led to a ``pushkin '', and more waves was not.
It gives me in a theater, clothing, music, in all genres, in addition to make.
 ``And it's all united in your art-club - i was important to go in the center of culture of st. petersburg, where you will have to gather all the best creative force.
In 1995, i took the territory at pushkin, and there until it was not, there was a music club, a bohemian club, the house of st. petersburg bohemia.
Many there were born: prefectures of, tequila, remember the strap led with the project ``ear van gogh. ''
The cord and his friends sang under veneer light song, they were in a tight tights, among them was a trendy now composer igor vdovin.
When the band parted alive, she became a ``leningrad ''.
Trachtenberg was leading many programs before хали-галивских times.
We gave them trachtenberg, and went to his great career and basic education and training he received.
Gallery ``d 137 club, ''griboyedov is echoes from the art-club.
There our employees and habitue left.
I am a hero last century, when culture to mean something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was ``the people of our city. ''
In the nomination ``artist ''was named i ended my climaxes.
In the new time in the old rules may not work, i am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years can easily become popular, but the culture and the popularity of split, you can be popular, but not much culture.
 ``Your work is inherent in a recognizable style.
 ``Many of my paintings are hits in them of the relevance and the poignancy.
I will have the exhibition, ``the russian museum in the clowns. ''
Clowns - timeless category.
I used to social was now be so - it's painful and scared.
But in the clowns are spread, but the tragedy of people.
I love the grotesque, i have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by changing the totalitarian наказово.
Now on clothes meet based on external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And he may file a hand and spit in the face of it.
And deception will be removed with the help of a disguise.
 ``And we recently saw you in the role of urban organ-grinder. a cultural city should have such a hero.
It is me to be.
 - Maybe and commercial art may be a beautiful?
 ``Now, the commercial art should be careful, tactical, sweet.
Is the disintegration of cultures.
People used to crowded pack of la bohème loved one simple.
Now all crashed on the microscope, it is hard to like it all.
I do not hundred-dollar bill to everyone loved.
Now we need to think, who will like it.
Now every cult hero on 100 fans.
 And stas mikhailova comes at a few thousand!
 ``He's abandoned, there сексо-социальная sphere works.
And the cultural soil of 300 people, and 10,000 can not come, and ultimately less management, money, all dies.
I have fans, the main thing is they do not cheat, do not want to spoil their possessions.
I wrote in his youth such picture, that one collector they are on the wall next to the falconer and larionov gallows.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse.
They say: the culture of spiritual, cultural consumption.
There is no culture among consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man culture yesterday, raised by the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, renounced the money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I am for that kind of that culture.
 - Kirill, what's missing petersburg?
 ``Good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: official from the culture.
But not all of them will be able to engage in culture.
In the right tsars it's not that was the kings, can not really understand the culture, but they understood that we have to keep the right experts.
Here in moscow now good consultants.
We have in st. petersburg people have that could be experts, but they are pushed as need higher experts, which will appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thriving taste.
The same erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should seek other museums.
 ``What's wrong for you - st. petersburg?
 Petersburg - it's not a cultural capital of the moscow culture is much more, there is the soil.
But on the keystone of our art to grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, this is wrong.
Here in europe is a lot of people who are just curious. who go to exhibitions and concerts.
We have got this layer subtle.
We need to do a fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on grant funds of st. petersburg
Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a minor.
The caravan spacecraft with earthlings on board sent to the search for extra planet.
To save humanity, the main question of how to continue its species in the context of weightlessness or on the same backup planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, these planets are only two, which can be implemented at least hypothetically.
``It's venus and mars, ''said a senior fellow at the state institute for astronomy name. sternberg (sai) vladimir mute.
But if mars conditions more suitable for life on the surface of venus - the temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of venus... in space.
Approach the reproduction in space started with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments with plants.
Four generations raised on orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties.
Then is the breeding in orbit insects, tiny fruit мух-дрозофил.
In 1979 in the cosmos sent quail eggs to check as developing embryo in the context of weightlessness.
We get on the output is absolutely normal unevenly.
And then begins the problem.
``The problem with the fact that this nestling must find a support base, he must stand on your legs and start moving, ''explains the head of the laboratory of the institute of biomedical problems (имбп of vladimir сычев.
Not finding support, the chicks messy somersaulting.
And after 10 hours of infant was full of atrophy instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that through four days they just died.
``And twice we hatches chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible there with them to work, ''stated the failure of the experiment with birds in space vladimir сычев.
With animals last biological ``minicomputer ''flew into orbit for 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments.
However, on биоспутнике ``bion ''will be only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment with rats, sent into space from the fetus.
In principle, it's not found anything supernatural.
``It's just been on биоспутниках, but again - this is an isolated experiment, and such studies need to do, ''said vladimir сычев.
After the landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But approach the problem of reproduction directly into space until it's not working.
No easy task.
Animals, losing a usual habitat, just can not realize your sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animal, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a emotional background.
On ethical grounds such experiments.
But women in space travel for the last 50 years.
The biggest risk had tereshkovoy.
But the most precious thing that humanity - it's a woman's organism.
Our seagull fled, and no one on earth could not say whether he after the flight into space.
Would she have a baby after this flight.
``It's on this question no one answered, ''says a veteran of space-rocket branch vakhtang vachnadze.
In june 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman valentina tereshkova gave birth to daughter.
The baby's father andrija nikolaev was also astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman svetlana savitsky, twice visited in orbit and even busy in outer space, and son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have very little units of the astronauts, which have after long flights all right, and grow a healthy generation.
``And if that's dangerous, even with orbital flight, ''concludes cosmonaut, hero of the soviet union, the hero of russia valery polyakov.
And yet, the humanity to look for any new paths in biotechnology, the protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
Hydrological cpc is mandatory step in preparation for the flight.
In conditions of neutral buoyancy astronauts practical skills of work in outer space.
The water simulated weightlessness.
If the adult water, and comfortable, but it is free from the environment for infants - honey element.
The little ихтиандры confirm if - life on land out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is located approximately 9 months of my mom in окоплодной fluid, is easier for him to get the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, only two weeks.
``It's very little to forget something, ''says instructor dosage swimming marina aksyonova.
In a word, if a child born for weightlessness more natural state, for a woman is necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness growing tummy muscles, pelvis, and the ability to expel the fetus.
Okay, and it is relying on stimulants of labor activity.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go to the birth, she will push him.
``Then what? ''asks a nontrivial question valery polyakov.
On the other hand, the baby needs artificial gravity.
With no sense of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscular system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special load suit for training.
He would just be deprived of the fact that he will be vital.
``And this experiment, which we have come for the birth of a child in the alien environment, will lead to the fact that we bring on the disabled, fully disadaptive person, ''predicts the director of the committee on bioethics имбп ras igor pestov.
Until the birth of children in space - the question of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships in the far-off planet that will be a home for their descendants, born in space.
Head of the main control management: check schwarz-bart failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, czech republic provides good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement, muiraslau kala, vice president of the supreme control, from an interview for the site aktuálně. cz.
``The law will never be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough, ''commented on the current situation stool.
Such conclusion provides joint inspection of the czech and german control bodies.
As an example of improper practices lead approach petra нечаса to so-called schwarz-bart.
Recently, the prime minister declared that the gfc (civic democratic party) will not bother entrepreneurs - so it is forbidden or allowed?
``The law should be in any way, and, if he's forbidden, and the prime minister can not resist the institutions, which are required to check and pursue obligations, ''stated kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee, in the chamber of deputies you talked about the joint project between czech and german side, within the framework of which it was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
In parallel testing, we began, probably two years ago.
Simply put, it's about the fact that a european law claims, how should receive government procurement, followed by national legislation and then another application in practice.
All information was collected and, even if still unfinished inspection found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we could have ``accurate and unmistakable '', but in practice we are in certain parameters in germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, it is necessary to focus on the use of the law.
But actually like this project can help you, that he does it mean for you?
This joint control can contribute to efforts to stop refining laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting appropriate things beyond a reasonable (but not always low) price, to avoid enrichment, and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve lower limit orders.
Perhaps, this system fulness ``papers ''that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if restriction does not decreased.
You are talking about internal problems of the practical application of the law on state procurement.
And as a system of control in germany?
Is there such an organization as our kru (control), or is it works differently?
As for institutions, then there as our crewe acts bundesliga, arranged in our principle, there are also colleagues working a little different, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because germany a federal structure, there are units of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in this system is somewhat different from ours.
Brh can only control federal money, we dispose of public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities controlled at the level of federal accounting chamber.
As for local laws, there would be easier than we have?
In fact, i would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respect germany can be used as a sample, but you can not definitely say that it is better in all.
So, because they are better able to control?
Definitely not, but then again, i do not like such comparisons.
But we have to say that even exemplary country faces many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
If you are talking about the domestic legislation, as the impact on your institution amendment of the public procurement, somehow manifest consequences?
Given that the validity of these amendments rather short, it still does not display in our works under control.
Since we have to spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.
We take it into account only in the process of training of future audits - we have started to use our new tool detection non-economistsâ€ risk, ''through which we ran nearly 14,000 government contracts, we analyze them. there, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of pitches and so on.
How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an additional strain on the system of the bureaucracy?
I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and i hope that it is confirmed.
The problem, which may arise that rules ``tightening ''and they will not be observed.
During the functioning of the previous control rules of the enterprise intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programmes - with the regional council) that any failure of the law on public procurement means a violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case, tighten the law in this way?
I do not think this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit a formal error, not affecting the decision.
This system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path nowhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that gdp will not bother entrepreneurs inspections of the so-called schwarz-bart. what does that mean?
``Schwarz-bart ''is forbidden or permission?
The law should be in any way, and, if he's forbidden, and the prime minister can not resist the work of the bodies, which are required to check and seek to fulfill their commitments.
You can say: ``we are going to switch this law and allow it, ''but you can not say that we will pretend that nothing happens.
The law on state procurement contains quite strict rules and must formally take place, and that's a good thing. this protects the public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer disqualified because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but he should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough.
Road places slithery, but mostly.

Shimon орнест: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about that less than a month there should be the end of the world?
It's only one of the many disturbing news, on which we are so easily.
Together with a group of the tap tap, we are playing on this subject and say that we are the only band in the world, which will be able to raise enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in december, you will give absolutely unique three shows against the end of the world.
Could you tell more about this readers?
We are talking about a national fund-raiser, which we plan for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the mayan calendar, which declared on 21 december at 11:10.
The day before the event of the 20th december at 21:00 parallel start three concert in prague, brno and ostrava.
They finished, roughly speaking, at the moment when on the island of kiribati in the pacific ocean, timezone for 12 hours earlier than we have finalized may calendar.
Who came to the idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we are all concocting together with our artist гонзой augusto.
Moreover, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we would also like together with the public think about the condition of this world we once pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of may calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original key against the end of the world. these things can be bought at http: / / www. e-tap. cz and thereby at the same time to support us.
A group of the tap tap, together with other musicians also sang a hymn against the end of the world, which is called ``the end of the world is cancelled. ''
It may sound like if already fancied listeners youtube anthem for these the concerts?
Of course, the very end, if the result will be able to do and the end of the world does not come.
Him sing all performers on all the concerts at the same time.
Hymns simultaneously ring also live czech tv.
To make this you wrote and played the role of jesus in the video tomasz ganac, participates in the performance also xindl x...
As you began to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personae czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Tried actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they wonder.
What's going on revenue from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for handicapped-accessible educational center studeo, for the sixth year we work with civil association tap at the institute of jedliczka.
Teachers regularly attend schools and students institute jedliczka spend them with joy and interesting events.
The students have no money to go to teachers, and we tried thus give them the opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of additional construction institute jedliczka in the future, a separate building, in which we can move with this project.
On every concert will perform several bands and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make the program, which might be interested in all generations, including children.
For example, in prague will perform chinasatcom, support lesbiens, illustrator with dan bart, the tap tap, marjan bango and jiří suchý.
All details can be found at http: / / www. kpks. cz.
Whether you are planning any such ``grandiose event ''in the future?
In may will first appear at the festival ``prague spring ''and then, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd love to a notion in the czech national house in new york, and i personally, if we will be in the united states, i would love to perform in washington and chicago.
About overseas you are serious, you have already played in madrid, brussels, london and moscow.
A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics?
It's not so bad, as it may seem at first glance.
We have got five participants on electric wheelchairs, their stroller should travel in the cargo hold of, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
Nevertheless, handle it without problems. czech airlines čsa and british airlines british airways has always been great for us prepared that ceases to amaze me how many times.
Even in moscow, where we have recently returned, it was no problem.
Thanks to participate abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards disabled people and so on.
What did you experience to date?
After madrid, luxembourg, london and other countries, where everything works better than we have in russia, we have witnessed that in the east is still on a basic level.
Compared with the prague in moscow is a lot of barriers, and here is still in wonderment independent movement of the person on electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
Also there not in such banal things as off the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there are public organizations, who are trying to draw the attention of people on the problems of people with disabilities.
And in than the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improve the situation, always depend on those people who are concerned.
In london and madrid is normal that people with severe disability independently move on the streets, can go into the toilet, at the museum, anyplace.
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in that we have them with the tap tap a bit ahead of!
Respect for public or handicapped-accessible is one thing, but at the moment, when we will have known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really began to change.
Until this isolated cases - people with strong will.
A group of the tap tap is currently very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998 you made her organization?
I entered the institute jedliczka as tutor, around me were a lot of young people who wanted to do something.
And because i am a musician and play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized interesting music group.
Well, with time, says our lead ладя angelovič, it's a little out of control (laughs).
The popularity came only in recent years, or something i lie?
It's true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on a propaganda group.
We conclude that the work that no one can appreciate, essentially like does not exist.
Thanks to the european union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Whether you stood in front of goal so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning i felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In the business a lot of things, imitating one another.
This is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long.
There are very few rare things, but i dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression from a person who can see us, of course, the pity, it's natural.
But this pity is completely unnecessary because some people with disabilities are not some kind of sufferings and all abandoned personality, which we must regret.
They are people who can live full lives and develop, of course, only on condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities get something, this shift not only for them, but also for the whole of society.
Whether the success of the fact that you are the strict supervisor, what you believe many?
If we want to do the job, we should be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.
But i think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic representation and fly in the clouds, and when they hear that twice a week they have to walk in rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very fast losing enthusiasm.
But it is so in any group that wants to work and accomplish something.
Currently in a group of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them was in the beginning in 1998?
Only one ладя angels.
We are open group, people come and go, it would be impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our door is always open.
He will take place on the day before the expected end of the world, on thursday nr at 21.00.
The concert will be held in prague on the stadium incheba in brno club - fléda and ostrava in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the czech republic.
At the end of a concert of all three cities in the bridge at the moment of execution of the tap tap, ``the end of the world's off. ''
The aim of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for the purchase of a handicapped-accessible equipment for educational center studeo at the institute for jedliczka in prague.
A ticket to the concert cost 400 eek, for children under 12 years of free entrance tickets can be bought in advance in bohemia.
Poland and space.
Last week at the meeting of ministers of the european space agency poland was accepted in 20 member of the european space agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern bloc (after the czech republic, which became a full-fledged member of the esa september 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with esa in 1994, and during the subsequent years took an active part in a number of projects agency.
But the way to space, poland began earlier this year.
Even before the second world war ii polish enthusiasts have flights into space, but it's not always met with understanding.
I would like to remind you, for example, about lectures. штернфельда, 6 december 1933 represented in the warsaw astronomical observatory of ideas from his pioneering work ``introduction in cosmonautics. ''
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left indifferent audience, after a few years штернфельд recalled that only dr jan gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 in france штернфельд won prize robert эсно-пельтри and andre luiz хирша for ``introduction in cosmonautics. ''
Dr. jan gadomski (1899 - 1966), about mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space.
He published in the polish journalist hundreds of articles and wrote several books on this discipline.
Gadomski became world famous propagandist space exploration, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, in poland was built a railway draisine, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear even to disperse or to brake the cart was supposed to be used by a rocket.
Information about this draisine known only from the press of that epoch.
Since 1933 polish artillery began to wonder about missile arrows.
A study conducted by section technology weapons in cooperation with professors mieczysław вольфке and gustav мокжицким.
From its historic materials, you can see that the study reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the advent of the german army work were interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of photovoltaic missiles, which offered engineer rogozin, and in the next year was the work of the ``air missiles and aircraft missiles ''author леливы-кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use rocket engine.
Before the war over all projects military use rocket technology was a temporary scientific advisory committee (tymczasowo komitet@refugee (), which coordinated the job.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended due to start a war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to the space exploration, appeared in the polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the polish society astronomy (polskie towarzystwo astronomy).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the november issue of 1954 magazine ``problems '', which are published four bulky articles on astronomy.
In one of them, professor m. subotiv offered to organize society, which will be in charge of the cosmonauts.
At that time already gaining traction art project satellites, and it was clear that the space research: a viable industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 polish society astronomy (ooa) has sought to join the international federation of astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn ooa became the actual member.
And the following year, the first chairman of poá kazimierz заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the international federation of astronomy.
In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 ooa contributed to the development of highly successful meteorological missiles rm (rakieta meteor), which became the first polish missile, a scientific study.
The first type of rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on october 10, 1958.
A missile capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built an enhanced version of the rm-1а, and in the summer of 1959 on bledow field test was conducted two-stage rocket rm-2.
That rocket was at length about 1.4 metres, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was able to do this scientific work - a rocket rm-34 overcame 14.5 km, and her assignment was to monitor high wind.
But in 1962, the further development was suspended.
The heir of the first missile type rm became a rocket meteor, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 years.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length of 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
We have developed three type (marked as meteor -1в and -1с), which are different size cameras for scientific equipment.
The rocket meteor had space of 0.4 l meteorological - 0.34 l and meteorological - 0,62л.
A maximum range at all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in aviation institute was the development of missiles meteor, and her first flight tests started in october 1970.
The rocket meteor with the initial weight 380 kg was able to lead the payload weight of 10 kg at the height of about 60 km.
Then there were built versions of meteorology and meteorology.
You should also mention the membership in the committee on space research (cospar) in 1960, and establishing a national committee of the cospar two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the intercosmos, poland participated in the space research on the soviet artificial satellite, and in 1978 polish pilot mirosław hermaszewski became the second intercom after ремека vladimir.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decree has provoked a lively discussion in society.
No doubt that it will be interesting to look at the problem with the wider point of view.
The liberal economic system in the eu, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that separate economic division, national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade, free and unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in cost of the labor force (wage) price tension.
Under this concept you need to understand the manufacturer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition by the fact that ``intrigued ''cost competitor to take a larger part of the market, and thus increase own income.
In a massive scale it means for the majority of entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labour, compared with other high.
Because private capital bears no social responsibility, including for their unemployment, grow the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the economic and social damage inflicted by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that they do not need to give specific statistical data.
Unceremoniously methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states of the situation, when governments are forced to join in competition with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the purpose of attraction in the country of foreign capital.
In other words, the government to give its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes of current legislation.
The goal is economically get your ​​народ comply with the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool of slashing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result of rising levels of poverty, and together with the difference between rich and poor.
In germany for several years already existing public distribution of products to the poor who are not able to feed themselves own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching million.
In the framework of raising the competitiveness of the german economy is constantly occurring cases when employed people receive that salary, that the state, it must be extra, so they could get a living wage.
A similar scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional workers in the bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the eu, undoubtedly, lead to the same condition in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in the social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on the extremely low pay on the margins of society in the hope that one day in the country will come private investment capital.
However, the question is, how does he do?
If the funds will come from other eu countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, so as a chinese, indian, brazilian, turk, morocco, egyptian africa still works for a fraction of european wages.
This applies to the entire latin america.
Liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state can not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital obstinately insisted that the state should not interfere management actions in the economy.
Next, you should answer the question is whether private capital, now almost management policy and the whole state in our own selfish purposes?
A clear answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, emerging in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources to develop legislative private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills claims the bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, according to the constitution of the western type, but from financial groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal democracy now quickly turns into a ​​ситуации, as described in the appiani work, ``crisis of roman empire in the days of julius caesar and pompey '':`` the government has long been disintegrated, and agencies are involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal receipt favours with the help of rocks and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the election with a previously sold voice ''... decent people do not for the post of government in the end, once the state for eight months left without consultation.'' seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for the choice of human energy. ''. appianus thought it would be pompey, but they became caesar that finally changed democracy in autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.
Private capital has already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform deeper character.
So causes of fascist and communist regimes, we should seek in a reckless liberal economic system 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected to be the next round.
Above all tragic fact that the current elite totally ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is no solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and european level, the government of the czech republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is a systematic character.
The decision is the target of social and political reforms that will strengthen the fractional part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in a society in favor of the state.
Israel: laboratory chaos.
``The violence does not work, and can never get out ''- sting, the`` fragile'', where the main verse refrain in the words: ``do not forget, we are fragile. ''
``If my sons did not want war, they would not have a`` is a dying at шнапер, wife меера амшела rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between israel and gaza, as always, caused a lot of feedback.
Some advocate for israel, arguing his position of the fact that he has the right to self-defense, but the palestinians act as terrorists, others support the palestinians, arguing that racism of the state of israel, genocide committed over the palestinian arabs, but the state of israel attributed to the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who is in these periodically repeated waves of killings, criminal, and who the victim in the end of today's citizens of israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers peek behind the curtain to take a look at who primarily serve still-lasting for 95 years voltage (counting from the signing of the balfour declaration in november 1917) in a small plot of land in the middle east.
Some of my reasoning buttressed by the historical facts, some of them placed on the basis of my own understanding of who or what a group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the story of a struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same alexander the great or napoleon.
That is not so clear - always whether these people completely independently take your steps, or for their throne was someone who directed their actions to advance its goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the international wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and resulting from the authorities could not happen in life of one generation.
Among astronomically wealthy families is one that could be viewed as the head of the octopus (i do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - rothschilds.
About a lot of them did not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (reuters) they bought already in the 1990s, the 19th century, to stop the rumors, connecting them with the criminal actions in high places, in the shadow of which they were, and that had always been to strengthen their power, wealth or both, and to another.
They are large shareholdings almost in all central banks of the world and the countries, in whose central banks they do not have its share of, they lead or preparation war (before the invasion of afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of iraq was 5 countries after the overthrow of gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the russian government took the central bank of their country into their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for rothschild bank of america, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (understanding - government money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
John f. kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish fed (federal reserve system), was assassinated in 1963. deputy louis mcfadden was poisoned in 1936 after i wanted to sue the fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 in 1871 led to developing a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason for the 33rd level пайком albert.
The task of the first war was to disrupt the monarchical state in europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially in the uk, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than as a precondition for this kind of project) and the seizure of absolute power.
Method, with the help of which has a team of the richest families headed by the rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - the order from chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration (see the fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war through the killing of prince heir of the austro-hungarian throne ferdinand in sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial russia, beginning of the bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ii ended in a sudden, unnecessary in military and economic surrender germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of tsarist russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing central powers, austria-hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing to germany huge war reparations, than a precondition to radicalise the impoverished masses, then remained only throw the germans strong enough, convicting the guilty and offering a simple solution leader, on a multinational czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, which is supposed to play, and i really played a function of the fifth column, stoking the fire of the war.
In the late 19th century rothschilds provoked the foundation of the zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a jewish state, preferably in the history of judea from jerusalem as its capital (return in zion).
The balfour declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of jews in palestine, began to happen the first clash with the local arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
An outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to estimate, loose if hitler from fetters, in which it initially kept bankers, or what he did, it was planned in any case, the suffering of the european jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for recognition of the jewish state of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, like germany was triggered by military reparations for the first world war, the state of israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of the third war.
If the international bankers will manage to start, the jewish people, as in the second world war, become a victim of military actions in the front lines, now together with the arab or muslim population in the middle east.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of contention and chaos, not just within the country, but also at the international level (only take the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of israel).
Whose fault, who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for a global power?
It is important to distinguish the ordinary people of israel against their leaders, because we do and international bankers palm off people for a vote on election exclusively their own candidates.
The current prime minister of israel, a hawk netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers politician, keen to start a war with iran, which, through membership of iran, the shanghai cooperation organization (china, india, russia, pakistan...), will threaten progress in the global conflict, and given control of iran over hormuz, contains 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide), is also lead to the destruction of the global economy.
In what kind of light now manifest in the words uttered by david rockefeller in 1994: ``what we need is the general crisis, and the people of the new world order. ''
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, enjoy the comfort.
A world where every person was born the body at the birth of implanting chip, with whom he becomes a under a total control.
``It makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to have on the right hand or forehead on the brand, so that the man who has not been marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, you could not buy or sell.
Here's the wisdom: each person who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it corresponds to the name of person, and the number is - six hundred sixty six.
The film ``operation`` argo '': when worse call hollywood
In november 1979 crowd islamist students captured the us embassy in tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted shah mohammad reza pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the united states, which were the patron of his regime for decades.
For the us administration, the positive outcome of the situation is not meant she could not afford to throw the shah overboard, because it is in the bud could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of hostages in iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was in no condition.
It was a hit at the prestige of the united states, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of algeria.
Their fate caused a house wave of solidarity and anti-iranian sentiment.
Defeat in iran largely contributed to the defeat of jimmy carter in the presidential election in 1980, ended the election of ronald reagan.
The film, my ford falcon coupe actor ben affleck operation ``argo ''describes one of the episodes of the story, which brought america small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy of six workers managed to escape.
After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence at the canadian embassy.
The cia in cooperation with the canadian government managed to take them out of iran, at the same time, helped an extravagant legend cover, according to which they went on a canadian passport as members of the crew, looking in the country place for filming science-fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented an expert on ``evacuation ''tony mendez, demanded that the cooperation of hollywood.
To the legend was reliable, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, a fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time was kept in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of tony mendez.
The film affleck is a special combination of different genres.
With one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called ``film '', the history of successful venture, scam is an example can be a number of films about friends ocean.
In the film constantly change the mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from tehran (credited shown trophy historic photos of events, and the way the same situation were demonstrated in the film, the large differences in this is not present).
On the other hand, lighter-weight hollywood passages, criss-crossing with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then another scenes from the headquarters of the cia and other institutions - men in suits to discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations on the staircases institutions on the phone.
Ben affleck has managed to do great resets career.
The roasted actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
``The operation`` argo ''his third feature-length film, after dark detective ``gone baby gone'' (2007) and the thriller`` city ''(2010).
At the same time it was the first movie affleck, who is not starring in his hometown of the director's boston.
A sense of atmosphere places at the same time, a quality elevated over early films directed by the hollywood standard.
And ben affleck is displayed in ``argo '', where tehran plays canada.
The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - introductory scene of the fall of the embassy of the impressive clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and unpredictable that arise when somewhere suddenly changes story.
A similar effect ben affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters on tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply a variety of exciting scenes of cinematic values.
He's quite successfully work with this little things sometimes imagine there - it all comes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in america to prevent the looming crisis in the airport of tehran, and the rush on the runway look rather farfetched).
The lack of ``argo ''is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan arkin and john goodman in the role of hollywood colleagues is really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are in the film is not the only.
The film affleck lacks a little drama, it's a movie, which can be viewed with the moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro re-creating thrillers seventies.
But with difficulty.
However, that's enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated ideas about the all-powerful and all-knowing special services.
The rules of the balloons, bananas and circus
Portal www. bankovnipoplatky. com, annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce a competition for ``the most absurd decision or project from the eu. ''
``We are what inspired by the recent events in which the eu plans to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major european companies, ''said`` right'' organizer questionnaire patrick нагер.
Among already put forward for the nomination of absurd - the recent decision of the european court of justice to unify the premium rates for men and women.
Still, women had privileges on life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively are less vulnerable.
``Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the eu people can advance the contest until the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of february 2013, ''he said нагер.
Questionable orders of the eu, for example, compulsory and adding biocomplex in fuel, as a result of the damage to the nature, as well as the ban on using reliable mercury degrees only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or the directive on the amount of cells for chickens, resulting in this year has become the eggs.
Also criticized a de facto ban on the use of the term ``sandwich butter ''or withdrawing from the sale of classical bulbs.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 inches in length.
A pan-european apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in brussels usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the czech republic now even under the threat of the veto defends the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby: for example, bananas and top quality in the european union should reach 1.8m in 14 cm and did not dare to exercise ``abnormal curvature. ''
At the same time, the european commission was justified by the fact that only harmonised existing scattered national rules, which are complicated by trade.
The eu, despite the resistance of some states still softened standards on fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to wasteful products.
The candidate for the win in the poll may become the last year's resolution of the eu, according to which sold balloons must necessarily contain warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.
The eu addressed the american research, in accordance with the balloons in the game are potential cause of death of children by means of suffocation.
This restriction now applies for children under 14 years, which is prohibited to blow in foreign дуделки.
Fun ideas are born and home
Enough is absurd and rule on the european officials: everyone has the eu in any official position, it can not, given the sensitive topic for greece, use the name macedonia, and must instead say ``fyrom ''(the former yugoslav republic of macedonia).
Portal bankovnípoplatky. com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists ''principle of non-interference'' (laissez faire), offered for a vote, in addition to a number of the above absurd rules, for example, eu rules about the amount of food on the territory of the membership of the state.
The eu set the maximum amount of supplies of food, which could be kept on the territory of the czech republic on the day of its entry into the european union.
Subsequently, the czech republic exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a heavy fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire also interested and the idea of paying some countries for what they have no sea, and the idea to provide subsidies for the application for a subsidy.
But these ideas have arisen in prague, and not in brussels.
``We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Ask the european union for compensation, ''said the autumn of 2004, then minister of agriculture jaroslav palace (cssd).
As an argument he pointed out that in the country was a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional procurement state had full warehouses reserves, which it was necessary to remove.
For the fact that the czech republic is situated far from ports, the eu, according to palazuelos, it was supposed to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the european commission went towards the czech republic, ordered a tender for the purchase of grain from the countries which are landlocked.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages by the ministry of regional development, ministry of paul german (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies should have gone on filing for subsidies from brussels.
Eu: bizarre orders are an exception
Although the resolution, the member states can become criticism, the eu effort on regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the european union, according to many experts who deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is a vase eu subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something in common with the deepening european integration, but which member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
Causes emotions among czechs and that as in other eu countries, the czech republic must fight in brussels for the right to a specific identity of their traditional products, and she does not always wins in this competition.
Although the czechs after six years of fighting with the germans and austria retained the name of ``olomoucké syrečky, ''but`` туземский rum,'' tradition in our country, its roots in the 19th century, our producers were supposed to rename on туземак. ''
Called rum may only be products from sugarcane distillate, and not out of sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the eu, along with the world-famous cheeses ``feta ''and`` gorgonzola'', marzipan from a german lubeck or parma ham, who have already been, for example, karlovy rusk, pogorzelska and třeboň carp and saaz hops.
The trademark of the eu can be proud of pardubice carrot and hořice tubes.
People want me to preserve the republic, but i am an amateur, ''said okamura.
Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind running for president?
I do not think about how to become senator or president.
If we have in the country all function without problems, i am not running for.
But i can not watch over the past 20 years the country, as here scurrying around thieves, people increase taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when i see something that i do not like, i am trying to find a solution like this to change.
And since i was 40 years old, and i am independent person, not to any party, i have no other way to influence things, but to run for the post as a senator or president.
In the senate you hit, but soon went to the castle.
Whether you are thus not turn back to people who you choose?
I talked all the time that going in the struggle for presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the senate.
I later clarified that if i will be chosen by the senator, i will run for president.
My goal is not a post office - it's a tool with which i will make their views.
So i need the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the difficulty is not only with the fact that we as a nation ропщем at myself in a bar or a television, but are willing to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
For this added media, which denigrated a person, and that confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.
For example, i am told that i give bribes from journalists, or that i was an adviser to jiri paroubek.
Move on to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you have started with a thesis about material and criminal liability of politicians and return property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To this, it is necessary to change the law.
You have as the president of such authority is not present, and only a senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When i am as a citizen lobbying that all excursions became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is political - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he is deliberately thwarted, and it curbs citizens.
As an independent non-party man i have a much greater potential for assistance from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage in the fact that i, without the party layout in order, without regard to dogmas can take care of each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person, more relevant to the right or left?
With the czech point of view, it seems to me that i have attributed to the left.
For me is not important - a bit to the left or right.
It is important for me, so we go forward.
It is not about the fact that someone refers to the right, and some of the left, i want to unite people.
I have always back any good for society decision, will offer if his hrcm or gfc, and i am similarly be against a bad idea.
You are angry when someone says you populist.
But if you do not prove that you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have any ideal goals and views.
And that is what you have to try to approach.
You can even call it a populism, but all proposals on which i say, already operate in the world, or about them say prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics, you will not hang on.
Or do you think when you exit to the people and talk with them, you will be able to implement and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and public and try to poach them on their side, so we have succeeded.
If i was elected president, i would not be any problem to organize a direct tv broadcasting, in which i shall refer to the heads of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they are in case of failure, will have to inform, why do not want.
If there is a strong personality, which outline the abuse of, you could put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a tribute to public pressure.
I speak directly, that i am an amateur, and not a genius, and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to assert their beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority.
I am trying to promote themselves; in the case, if it fails, six years will be done and will be back in the private sector.
This is partly sounds like okamura should save the czech republic.
I is not a savior.
I know, i will not do anything, so i visited a number of well-known people with a proposal to run in the senate.
I went to the радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with the large amount of work.
Also at least i supported the leading investigative journalist ian lorenzo, which opened fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran because people really unsatisfactory, but now i feel at stake.
Sixty percent of people do not go to elections, and most of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
We are independent in the senate only two.
The people chose the senate so that the changes will be conducted with difficulty.
Despite this, i will fight for their views, for example, for any direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of their own party?
I have not thought, because i have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential side, and i have no money on this.
No money and the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You have no money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how your own affairs with this?
Personal assets estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have the plot in prague will cost approximately 25 million apartment at 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art by roughly 10 million, on астон-мартин 3.5 million and the škoda per million, and for a few million on the account.
Incidentally астон-мартин i got, because it was my boy dream - i always liked james bond, who drove the car was gallant with women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You are running on астон-мартине owns property to 60 million and you do not have any money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money separately in it do not want to invest.
It's not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
In the campaign i have already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that i have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And i am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on campaign i essentially covers senator salary.
But on the money i would not have survived, for example, could not pay son for english school, which costs $30,000 a month.
If i wanted only to earn some money, so anywhere would not ran.
So, you will be engaged in business, so you can live?
You do not say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As i promised, its activity i partly reduced.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy.
People would like to see that i was sts, which would keep the republic.
But i just need to do something for a living.
As much as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive a monthly basis?
From 200 to 400 thousand, i get further.
And if i became president, his enterprise would finish.
The full interview you will find in the saturday edition of the newspaper ``right ''.
Architects mvrdv argue that real adventures are not only in the popular imagination - on the example of spijkenisse and its newly built book mountains - 2 photos
``I think that building fun, it looks futuristic, finally we have again, you can see something interesting, ''says lisette wehrheim, passing on the edge of the road.
While stefan sperm, an expert on it at the nearby a large company, said: ``no, this building really beautiful. ''
But i ask myself: why do we need today another library?
All of them have internet, ipad and electronic books.
It is now no one voluntarily does not go to such old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, unattractive bedroom town under the rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of richly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library!
Blame maas of rotterdam, the bureau of architecture mvrdv, master bold any diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the problem with his usual calmness and appeared on the contest audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, cocky maas folded from its original gifts pyramid in size and completed a speech in defense of his project in the following words: ``dear citizens! ''
Here's my suggestion: ``book mountain ''in spijkenisse, the so-called букенберг!
Nine years later, this mountain of 30 million euros.
She is part of a project revitalization, which also includes the underground garage, supermarket, mail, and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of november, ''book mountain'' was awarded with the second prize contest of the best library of the netherlands 2012.
The plan also participates in the dutch national contest wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, a featureless suburb, which could not offer anything except postmodern pedestrian zone, and surprisingly bad hall, white facades which suggests milk, became richer on one modern masterpiece of architecture.
But the most important thing is in spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to the book
First impression: knizhnoe eldorado covered for cheese.
There's only one elevator in the center of a mountain array, because real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Glass from all sides premise - a bright and easily foreseeable floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square.
City environment recreating ideal.
Opinion involuntarily seeks benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
``Usually bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually comfortless and impersonal, ''says blame maas.
We put a classic configuration space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountains skillfully used in the heart of the city, have offices, internet, chess club, ecological center and technical areas.
Especially compelling black bookshelves that serve as the finish of walls, the parapet, the staircase railing.
Their view, texture and unusual odor.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers are lost in the roadway, what is the unknown material.
``We were eager to work with secondary materials, ''explains joop трауборст, project manager, representing the community of spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at the same agricultural enterprise in friesland we met a suitable byproduct of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and the fields in the netherlands as a lining under the roots of artificial fiber materials mm thickness.
That's cheap and saves time.
The thin textile serves as a couple of seasons, after that he can throw it away.
For the library that fabric - for the first time in such amounts - was pressed in the thick four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell of a little like a new car, and a bit of sneakers.
On top conduct 105 steps.
The one who breaks the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in literary cafés not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch crockett and trees фикусами in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and in the first turn of the right humidity on literary grief.
The costs of a new soul
``It is hard to believe, but this building, despite the multitude of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology, ''says троуборст.
For his heating and cooling used the warmth of the earth.
Although book mountain is the bell jar, even on clear days of the sun comes in just for a while.
A wide range of farm from laminated wood, located in perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and assumes most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan sperm, aforesaid skeptic from the sphere of it, has visited the new library.
Lisette wehrheim also was already here.
As well as a teacher of traditional chinese medicine cynthia bogarde, which called букенберг ``soul spijkenisse, which has not enough. ''
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of every resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from the permanent collection.
These books were supposed to take the blank space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed the library at that moment in her was delivering books.
The idea off.
Shelves laden to the brim.
``There is nothing worse than half-empty library, ''says the architect blame maas.
``I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only as a decoration.
Thus mvrdv managed to cope with the royal task, which is on the professional jargon called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And if they are very young and irreversible.
It's only the starting point for construction of identity.
Szabo: ``the germans should play an important role. ''
Germany abstained on the recognition of palestine.
According to stephen szabo, an expert on relations between the united states and europe, in doing so, berlin is teetering on the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche welle: at the beginning of the week germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of palestinians to obtain the observer status in the united nations.
But then berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen szabo: germany does not support israeli actions in gaza.
Now germany must be careful in connection with its special relations with israel.
But at the same time, i believe that the american position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - and without speaking too critical against israel.
During the uprising in libya in march 2011 germany also abstained on the introduction of a no-go zone for flights.
As a result, nato held this proposal.
Germany is difficult to occupy a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is located in the process of transformation of his foreign policy, namely passes from policy, which, so to speak, run by the united states, the german foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the europeans have not accepted the uniform policy.
Thus, the germans are again between the two fronts.
From them is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.
I believe that while they are just fumble their role, but are on the path toward a more ``normal ''foreign policy.
A foreign policy, which conducts france or britain.
What exactly means ``normal ''foreign policy with the german point of view?
It is the willingness to take in its national interest position, unaffected by the united states or european partners.
I believe that the german foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.&space;e. from exports and ties with certain regions, such as russia, china, or the middle east.
The economic interests of germany largely differ from the interests of other major states, and however germany must protect their interests.
About these economic interests on the position in the middle east conflict and to vote in the un?
First, germany has major markets in the middle east, in particular in the persian gulf.
However she needs to be careful not to offend the public and elite in arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But i would not care too much importance, it's not entirely one-way connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the germans.
Hurt whether germany to its relations with the united states, refraining in making important decisions, such as a vote of palestine?
I am sure that in europe and even in the united states dominated by the understanding of the german position.
So i do not think that it was the same dramatic reed, as in the libyan issue.
Possibly germany even acquires thus a certain respect.
Because it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that with its interests should be considered.
In europe, there are different opinions on the palestinian initiative.
The united states, by contrast, clearly favours a veto.
If there are differences of opinion between the united states and many european states?
In the force of the american domestic policy, such differences have always co-existed.
I believe that the obama administration in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of the european position.
But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly occupy such a position.
I believe that substantial disagreements are not so, as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between obama and prime minister netanyahu, you will notice that the obama administration is not thrilled about policy netanyahu.
Is it easy for germany to combine their close ties with israel and the united states on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the eu with the other?
I think that's what makes a difficult situation for the germans.
Of course, the germans would be somewhat easier, if there is the creation of a consistent european policy, but now it's not.
So they can not act in the broader approach and must instead act just on the basis of their own vision of the situation.
That's how they come with the euro.
I think that in the future of germany will take the lead role in the development of a common european stance.
It is clear that in germany, it's not easy, at least because of ties with israel.
This issue has always been so tacky.
But i think the germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
If germany itself sees himself in the role of important international player is not whether she's really the main character?
Or a lead role still had a hard time making germany?
Germany had not used to it, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time germany assumes the role of a variety of anti-german feelings.
The germans do not just deal with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this standpoint, germany is in much more difficult situation, than the united states.
She should take into consideration the different neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
So, the influence of the usa in european politics constantly lowered, but at this time, the eu does not fill the vacuum, then who remains?
The germans will just have to play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or intense dislike of you - it's a fact of life!
Stephen szabo, deputy director of the transatlantic academy in washington, the institute, in which academics and experts from europe and north america joint research problems of the transatlantic community.
In addition, szabo is a member of the german marshall fund, in which he specializes in german politics, us foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
``Protection of the trademark in china: when puma and armani suddenly become chinese
Armani is internationally famous trademark, polo ralph lauren, too.
But what is armani polo?
It is officially registered in china name that has nothing to do with companies, from which it is education.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original name sued.
But then it is unclear whether they will defend their rights.
``Foreigners becoming to protect their trademarks in china, ''said thomas паттлох, taylor wessing lawyer company specializing in violations of trademarks in the far east.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Simulator to add a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
From gucci at lu-gucci, instead of prada you can register prada-kny.
This way legally copied german enterprises, such as the manufacturer of sporting goods puma.
Opens the folder паттлох with records agency trademark registration in beijing.
On september 14, 2010, the chinese company registered there a trademark zegna df puma, artificial name, which also uses the name of the fashion house ermenegildo zegna.
The fact that the chinese - world champions by copying and an infringement of intellectual property rights.
In large cities have multi-storey stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
But matters паттлоха are not. on behalf of its clients he opposed to chinese enterprises completely officially received from the office of trademarks are the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The chinese call it ``ban ''минпай, marca-relli.
This word associated with 'ban дакуань. ''
So call women who prey for rich men.
The chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
``It damages the business with it, it is necessary to fight, ''паттлох convinced.
``Trade mark erodes, a unique position is lost, the image suffered tremendously. ''
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the company by market research clsa, china, with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third on the size and the fastest-growing market for luxury items.
But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks hard, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.
Tells about паттлох cases in which a court rejected claims, as the expiration of a long time to appeal the name has become the ``reality market. ''
If a complainant is not lucky, he even will have to pay plagiarism, as damaged his trade mark in china, says паттлох.
Sometimes the law of the jungle.
There is also famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company daimler lost legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery company sany, that shortly before acquired manufacturer goker putzmeister.
Therefore, the chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of mercedes.
The company geely bought volvo originally used a blue / white logo, reminding bmw; and the process was successful, geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion product lacoste lost in china simulator from hong kong and singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other side.
The chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
Department of the trademark registration ctmo in beijing confirms that, in 2010 due to lack of equipment and personnel premises there took place difficulties.
But in the past year there was a ``return from an emergency situation in the process to normal. ''
So, the amount of untreated cases in the objections dropped by 22 percent.
They closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the ministry.
Fight this expensive
As very often in china, are impressive figures.
In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
It's a record and means that china in the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 was paid $1.8 billion yuan fees.
In a simple, it means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Appeal against her worth many times, as shown in the case of the german family company freude.
For more than seven years the group is fighting against the chinese plagiarist.
The germans managed to achieve that illicit production of their fake auto parts was liquidated.
However, the simulator for chinese rights on the trade mark freude.
It was their own incompetence, as the names in germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the freude chemical familie in munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim of munich.
Really, in both instances of the following freude won, but against the party continues to struggle so far.
It is necessary to be alert.
The question now is examined by the supreme court.
Вентцлер hopes to carry it on a good finish and praises the professionalism of the plane.
But he also says: ``the process of crumbling roads and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves. ''
Internal costs hardly yield accounting, archive firms had to view even acts of a hundred years, to lead the evidence.
Five years ago, freude inconclusively offered the other side of a six-figure sum in the euro ''for the settlement.
``This makes it clear how expensive it cost us, ''says вентцлер.
The danger of the far east threaten to break even in europe.
Namely, in case if imitators register there for a vulnerable trademarks.
So, a chinese manufacturer in germany wanted to register the name of freude for footwear and leather.
The group long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration.
``We need to be vigilant, ''says вентцлер.
As he and his lawyer паттлох recommend german enterprises to be very careful with china.
Not enough to rely on international position on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should be ``everything in any way is worth defending, also in china, ''says вентцлер.
Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if freude loses in the last act of his drama for a trade mark, it will be asked to pay a counterparty licensing fees for his own name, explains вентцлер.
Otherwise, we are excluded from the market in the dark segment.
The world aids day: stomping, singing, to help
In heidelberg choir rehearsing имбонги - and in swaziland aids orphan rejoice in it.
The history of relations who overcame over 8733 kilometers.
First blasts stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, lady pumps and male sneakers select a cycle on parquet floor and quickly find it.
Us.
Only after that slowly growing voice singers - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they occur, charm and follow each other.
And фите hopf, 29-year old conductor, almost comes from their cloth shoes, when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the musical hall of the institute of medical psychology in heidelberg имбонги choir rehearsing a new song.
For the rehearsal came 50 members of the glee club from 23 to 69 years old, from special human genetics to sweep.
``Ом"обани ''was a tough thing, every voice choir has its own text, plus a brand which is prima facie alien language: zulu, spoken by eleven million people in south africa, botswana, lesotho, malawi, mozambique and in some parts of swaziland.
Help for self-help
The evaluation of unaids, the united nations programme on hiv and aids, in the world there are about 34 million hiv-infected people.
23.5 million of them live in the south africa.
In swaziland lives 245 000 aids orphans.
With more than 40 percent of the population of hiv positive.
For 180 aids orphans in the village эситжени association voices for africa found bosses in germany.
70 of them attend school, preparing to study.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can assume patronage.
It ensures the money on the school, school uniform and daily hot meal in гого-центре.
The имбонги zulu language means narrator or praise.
In this room is not fluent in the bantu, but they can sing.
Almost a decade choir working song on this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: south africa.
After all, at a distance 8733 kilometers from 325 heidelberga, in the north-west of the kingdom of swaziland, there is a village эситжени, which depends on the votes of the german choir.
Infected forty percent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus ич.
In the эситжени in miniature reflected disease of swaziland: the highest levels of hiv infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to unicef.
Male circumcision, which is shown to reduce the risk of infection in half, among the population almost not accepted.
More than 40 per cent of swaziland's population is a human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth dozen is not unusual.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip in africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants имбогни saw a large number of children on the streets, that lack not only of parental care, but also just total: food, clothing, education.
Without school education of a person in a poor country there is no chance.
First it was a private commitment to individual participants - for a few euros per year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association ``voices for africa '', which has since almost professional cares about aids orphans in эситжени.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial sti classify syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (user).
Frequent viral stis are hiv, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and itchy refer to the parasite stis.
What are the main striking group?
Gonorrhea and syphilis meet mostly by men who have sex with men.
Robert koch institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in germany, the conveying occurs as a result of sex between men.
Among heterosexual adults the commonest sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infection, trichomoniasis candidate (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The spread of hiv among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new hiv infections in this group.
Among the youth chlamydia infections occur significantly more likely than among other groups.
European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people are also common human papillomavirus.
As changing the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the institute of robert koch, more than doubled with 1697 cases in 2001, before 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new hiv infections since 2007.
In 2011 was about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth lower than the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to an std?
In infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints on urination separations, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as bubbles or seal.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
As you can protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but it does not provide a full protection.
Partly because the bacteria sexually transmitted diseases, can be spread by contact infections, and in close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.
At early diagnosis can be cured by the majority of stis and avoid remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least royalties for the performance of the choir throughout germany allow something to collect.
``We are sent in эситжени already about 200 000 euros, ''says аннете lennart, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from germany disposes цодва dlamini, conscious and active women.
She also cares about orphans were good work, for example, one of the grandmothers.
As гогос call on zulu old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to afford to 14 orphans, give them a roof over your head and ensure that children in the form of every day in time appeared in the classroom.
Those who have not relic in a shelter for ханийсиле, a lonely woman, receiving a salary from the association, as well as two cook, that every day is preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association ``voices for africa ''organized a sewing school, constructed two chicken and jointly with the american organization to protect the health of psi organized the change in the analysis of hiv for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
The king with 14 wives
``Aids is an absolute taboo, ''says аннете lennart,`` because it is connected with sexuality.''
Quite unusual for the country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black africa, the king mswati iii, is known for his love of self-indulgence.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such a state-sanctioned lifestyle also blame for the fact that the virus ич so quickly spread in the past years.
But she is also for stray workers, which carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms have literally on every corner, says аннете lennart, ``but they almost do not use them.
Another culture - flesh is flesh. ''
To support a bit of a cultural exchange, the choir ибмогни every two to three years travels through the south africa and sings the song, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern edge of black continent know since apartheid.
A bus full of whites, who sing song on the black language - such recognition does not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened induced tears in front of harsh border guards.
A trip always also leads in эситжени, where singers attend sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the little village with difficulty can be found on a map in the valley of the river эцулвени she more than known.
``Go in эситжени, there light, ''say the people here.
And after the 8733-километрового flight back in heidelberg, when the singers топающие return to a rehearsal hall on the street bergheim, you can see that this light also here.
Messenger: nasa opens ice on mercury
The probe ``messenger ''found evidence that on the planet mercury is the ice.
The ice sheet may have the thickness of up to 20 meters.
The us space agency nasa evidence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it is located close to the sun, there is also the frozen water, as evidenced by the three studies published on thursday in a special journal science.
The probe ``messenger ''found evidence that constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, water comes with a comet or asteroid collision with mercury.
No one connects the opening of ice from the existence of life on the planet, ''said supervisor probe sean solomon.
The temperature at mercury can reach 426 degrees celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building blocks of life in other places of the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send on the ground image: small windows into endless dali.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the german researchers from the max planck institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet ceres.
As pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond neptune, ceres, under the new definition of the international astronomical union from 2006, is not a planet. ''
This piece of infrared image of the telescope spitzer represents ``family portrait ''of countless generations of stars: the old stars in the form of blue points, but it is harder to identify in a star of pink`` born-again'' stars.

One of the greatest and most clear images of the telescope hubble: whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies become in the works of art.
Published by the european southern observatory picture shows removed on a few thousand light-years from earth nebula трифид in the constellation sagittarius.
The name of the трифид comes from the latin word trifidus (three dollars, three), as dark strips dust is divided into three parts of the red-hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation ophiuchus astronomers photographed harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from earth, the kernel of two merging galaxies headed towards each other and inevitable clashes.
This star is born telescope hubble withdrew in a spiral galaxy m83.
Those who do not like technical reduction, may call it nicknamed ``the southern цевочное wheel ''.
Photograph of the hubble space telescope shows a fragment of the nebula of iris in the constellation of cephei.
Nebula, remote at 1400 light-years, consists of dust particles, size from 10 to 100 times less than the usual house dust.
This image was made up of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote on 430 million light-years from earth.
This group of galaxies called arp 273 photographed for nasa space telescope hubble.
A spiral galaxy scientists call was ugc 1810.
In this star-studded nebula is the most colourful group of new stars of our milky way.
Stellar cradle constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, coupled with rosette nebula, also constantly creates new stars at a distance of 5,000 light-years from earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole is still no dust, only the gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when in the universe in the vertical hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the key telescopes
Probably, a telescope was invented in 1608, hans lippert - even before galileo galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since the mirrors optical telescopes became increasingly available - and their opinion space deeper.
In the next 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope ''haleh'' at the palomar knot under the san diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In arizona, usa, a ``large binocular telescope. ''
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
``Gran canaria telescope ''has a huge internal device - the diameter of only one mirrors of 10.4 meters.
The mirror ''of the big south african telescope'' in south africa segment, for the sake of cost reduction.
Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tough countersignature under vertical angle - it limits his mobility.
``Hobby-eberly telescope ''in texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its special feature: the high svetoslav ability.
She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world's largest telescope.
With the help of radio telescope at arecibo (puerto rico) researchers heed of terrestrial signals in space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Participating in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (seti), any computer owner can help their processing power.
Views of the european astronomical observatory service (eso) in the chilean andes.
There's a ``very large telescope ''is entirely appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors to cover in the visual pipe of even average infrared spectrum.
In the chilean observatory eso is also planned to install a european ``very large telescope. ''
His main mirror should spread for 42 meters - and will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should not expect before 2018.
Until 2007 both telescope ``keck ''in hawaiian volcano мауна kea were the largest in the world.
In the two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters.
``The keck telescopes ''can be included in the observatory of mauna kea, which along with them looking into the sky also with the help of radio telescopes subaru and irttf.
In addition, the mauna kea should now be a new giant telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here, they can admire the view of the illustration.
However, the most important species from space delivers the hubble space telescope.
Since april 24, 1990, he delivers a picture of far-off worlds.
Since march 2009 space telescope ``kepler ''is looking for planets outside the solar system - first of all such, on which the possibility of life.
February 2, 2011, nasa reported that 1235 planet was discovered since the beginning of the mission.
The photos show a recent cooking space telescope ``kepler ''.
James webb space telescope (jwst) will be sent into space before 2018 aboard a rocket ''ariane 5.''
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he must be the first stars and galaxies to search for the big bang.
Scientists suggest that, on the south pole mercury is the ice.
However, reliable data on it is not present, as ``messenger ''revolves closer to the north pole of planet.
A radar measurements for decades pointed out that the mercury is the ice.
Thanks to launched in 2004 зонду ``messenger ''- the first, which revolves around mercury - scientists now for sure.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In the southern azerbaijan many residents reach biblically respectable age.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for a clue in the country, where old men gathering together 97-летние seem still relatively young.
In the southern azerbaijan many residents reach biblically respectable age.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for a clue in the country, where old men gathering together 97-летние seem still relatively young.
A trip through talysh mountains can be called wild and romantic.
Minibus with she rolls along the winding road past overgrown with dense forest hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant homes.
All around so green and bright, that you might think, if you are in the black forest.
But it is the southern edge of azerbaijan, iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Live talysh is one of the peoples of the caucasus, which is known about a little bit, not only that they are in farsi and azerbaijan and different longevity.
The final paragraph is lerik, azerbaijan.
A small town flaunts too heavy architecture of the soviet era, which is not in harmony with the beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from europe almost did not come here, the road from the azerbaijani capital baku too tedious.
On 323 kilometers away eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, which are the authors of the caspian sea oil, here, in a province until it.
However, pilate фатулаева (48) believe that лерике have something to interest of tourists.
``In may, baku has become famous song festival contest - and the next year we had the parent-son festival of the oldest person in the world, ''says фатулаева.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably only in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen talyshs of these places, which are over 100 years. фатулаева points to black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he begat another baby
But the controversial star of the museum is chaban shirali мюслюмов, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not present.
And taking into account the fact that the man, whose age is documented, under the age of 122 years, age мюслюмова highly questionable.
``He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973, ''explains фатулаева.
The man was married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he had allegedly daughter was born.
It added whether chaban мюслюмов a couple of decades to her age?
Even rembrandt scholz, a researcher at the age of the max planck institute in rostock, heard about the longevity in central asia.
``A surprising number of elderly people can be found in some areas of china, in japan or in gulkin, in the hunza valley of in pakistan, ''says scholz,`` in sardinia is also extremely a lot of very old people.''
However, due to lack of documents scientific proof of age, it is impossible because it has not been registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area лерика strikingly often reach the biblical age.
Now here 20 man over 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so many long-livers?
Azerbaijani guide farid мугимзаде explains this specific genes talysh.
The museum director фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition.
The talishs love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them is consumed by the glass baked oil every day. but it's unlikely that this higher diet can be healthy and nutritionist point of view.
Or the case in primitive way of life, which keeps people young? ченгемиране in tiny village near the town of lerik, azerbaijan, lives рубаба mirzoev.
In 97 years she's still relatively young for these latitudes.
, Which claims that she had a descendant of 143, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with munch oils that tirelessly bouncin around.
Under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter, which have been already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby ride the two children.
In the kitchen guests prepare tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied glasses армуду.
The мирзаевой perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, under the headscarves she hides long brown hair, that her son proudly explains to us.
I have always been my hair milk, so they will never fall and retain the color.
``And i never enjoyed a shampoo, ''says мирзаева.
A monthly pension enough for life
She always eat only what has grown in own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my life i never bought groceries in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hard part was after the second world war.
But better, when the ``beloved father ''of the heydar aliyev, stood at the helm.
The propaganda did not often heard in a speech of the old woman.
However, the cult of developments around the figure of father of the nation, which ruled the country as a dictator in azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son ilham.
Nevertheless among azerbaijani starikov no poverty.
230 manats (approximately still the same amount of eur) мирзаева receives monthly as pensions for local conditions of this amount by which you can live well.
And, perhaps, long gangling son мирзаевой too right: ``old people in our culture are deep respect. ''
They live in a big family, loved, safe and happy.
The more reason to stay alive as long as you can
The word ``human right ''is absent in the constitution
The revolution was back in cairo.
Rival demonstrations in cairo indicate a deep split of the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, met a violent resistance.
Egyptian president not to give the pathos.
We must create a transition.
``And his success is my responsibility to the people and before god, ''he said on state television.
His speech was turned to the whole people, but primarily to the christian коптам, liberals, enlightened mohammedans and irreligious egyptians.
After all, they are still hopelessly fragmented in confused opposition, are in fear.
The fear of the state religion on the nile at the mercy of powerful ``brothers ''.
Mohammed morsi, almost apologetically, said he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence, ''to save the revolution.''
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a degree of doctor of the american university of southern california, is not entirely clear egyptians and the whole world.
Whether it will be deprived of the force of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 article managed to smuggle into night 15-часовой jump with obstacles in islamist configured constitutional convention out of 100 participants, and it's partly concerns about the economy.
As in previous constitutions, in the project says that the judiciary is based on the principles of islamic law. ''
But what do you mean ``principles ''?
It was and remains the business of interpretation, and you can fear that islamists will use vague and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a strict interpretation of shariah.
At least, this suggests one of the newest article: in all matters relating to the sharia law should be sought for the council of the university of al-ashraf an islamist institution of the country, the great prestige in the sunni islam.
It should not, but may mean that the oversight of the law, which would be a consequence of the de facto limit of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: to continue the jurisdiction of civilians by military court.
These courts in the period of the mubarak served for the suppression of the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect ``the true nature of the egyptian family ''and`` keep her morals and values.''
Legally it formulated so fuzzy, that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature.
Open text it means nothing but censorship.
At one article does not set right equality of men and women.
But another banned insult and defame the prophet muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, it remains unclear.
Questionable is also the formula that it is prohibited ``insulting people. ''
Is it enough to be cartoons of the president or jokes about legal?
The question of interpretation, like a lot of things in this project, which morsi offers on the signature and, he said, ``very soon ''will be presented to egypt in the referendum.
``The revolution back ''
For several weeks of the opposition against the superiority of islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity in the evening friday in tahrir square in cairo and vowed to destroy this document, even before he will be able to enter into force.
``The revolution is back, and we will win, ''he said хамдин sabbah, took third place at the presidential election.
Nobel peace laureate and former head of the international atomic energy agency mohammed elbaradei stated that the draft constitution place at the dump history. ''
Through a short news on twitter, he accused supporters of morsi in a desire to lead a ``coup against democracy. ''
``If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and what do you say we split it, ''said the opposition national, yasser said.
``We have not tired, the blood of our brothers have not revenge, ''quoted egyptian media opposition politician khaled ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would have made him null and void.
``The koran is our constitution. ''
Well organized muslim brotherhood, in turn, have called for the opposite demonstration, but out of caution, not on tahrir square, and after mass prayers on the other side of the nile in front of the cairo university.
In her participated a large number of women under the covers and adherents of the salafis, who cried: ``people will require the use of god's law. ''
They demanded that morsi: ``secure country! ''and assured:`` the koran is our constitution.''
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, orchestrated a state practically civil war.
The followers of morsi, obviously, did not want to go on this risk.
The muslim brotherhood announced that, as opponents and supporters of the draft constitution voiced loud and clear.
Now it's time to give people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the islamists, that is considered to be resolved.
``The concept of`` human rights ''is not mentioned anywhere.''
Hafez abu sayeda in fury from this process of the constitutional process, which, actually, it was supposed to last until february with the participation of all social forces.
A 48-year-old lawyer on human rights and the chairman of the egyptian organization for human rights (еопр) defended ``brothers '', when mubarak they were in prison or before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights for weeks.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, was arrested.
Now the word ``human rights ''never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with the welt am sonntag.''
The expansion of the impact of morsi on all three branches of power in the state of disappointing lawyer.
These measures provide explicit strikes on democratic game rules and egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
``Instead of having to strengthen civil state, the de facto president cancels it, ''regrets sayeda.
Because without civil society organizations democracy can not function.
Sayeda feels that everyone left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For that may occur retribution.
A protester at tahrir square warns: ``you create a monster, which will not be able to control. ''
Norwegian ракфиск: the most bad smelling of fish in the world?
A five-minute population norway is one of the highest levels of life, not only in europe, but also around the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country was connected with the local craving for one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Take a few over ripen pieces of cheese.
Place them in a lot of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You have a sense of smell отшибающий smell of ракфиска - one of the most famous norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town called fagernes, three hours from oslo.
Around the snow-covered landscape. it's very nice, but in the air spill ineradicable characteristic smell.
``It's ракфиск trout, sprinkle with salt and cities in the water before the year, depending on what it is a delight to achieve.
As thicken twilight and cold, crowds of norwegians collected at the festival in fagernes, dedicated to that, for example, the fascinating dish.
``It eaten raw food and drink a glass to aquavit, the local тминной vodka, ''explains хавард halvarsson, a local fire by profession and a part-time ракфисковый general, who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat fresh diced small fish and its massive amounts of alcohol.
``Someone like aquavit, than ракфиск, ''says хавард.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If we manage to smuggle a piece of the nose, it's not so bad - differs little from portions of sushi, that you have long taken in the bus.
Norwegian ракфиск is a product of an entirely different times, the time of poverty, when, before the time of refrigerators, fish in the autumn of soaking in sealed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in the winter, when the fish is good and thoroughly zabrodin, her have, and muted perception of alcohol, eat.
Still on the memory of last generation of the fact that thousands of norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the united states.

On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the news around the world, and most of the inhabitants of the country, it seems to be satisfied.
The people are still reluctant to discuss the name of anders breivik, a racist and extreme right - wing, last year, shot and killed 77 men, women and children.

The president of mexico's enrique peña nieto to be a tough start career.
While the newly elected president of mexico enrique peña nieto is due to join the post, a correspondent for bbc will grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties that he will have to face, and for a mixed expectation of the population in his country.
The traffic in mexico city, especially now in shambles.
This city is overloaded transport, and in the best time, and monday were erected steel barricade, cut a few key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, it was not done in order not to give people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent protesters to get to the houses of parliament.
In sunday's new head of mexico's enrique peña nieto on the presidential sash and take the reins of the country.
He also faces the difficult task.
Mexico has made good economic indicators under the administration of felipe calderón, which now stacks of its powers, but the country has been embroiled in the war on drugs, which for six years already killed about 60,000 lives.
``My government says the people of mexico about their readiness to fight violence, ''said earlier this week, mr peña nieto us president barack obama in the oval office of the white house.
I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements with the president of the u.&space;s. political career of mr peña nieto developed in the post of governor of his home state of mexico city.
In his homeland, in a heavily populated and extensive state surrounding the capital city of the country, opinions about the new leader.
Outspoken people
In an idyllic town of valle, for example, about him remember fondly.
Residents put him in the merit of recovery tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
You can get to the city as part of the new highway, ''peña nieto, who is strikingly different from the road with potholes and silos, which were previously on this site.
Tablets with his name hang in the modern building sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
``We associate with him hope for real and serious changes, ''said his friend and political ally gabriel olvera hernández, congressman state from peña nieto spearheaded by the institutional revolutionary party (pri).
We expect real and drastic change, which is so badly needed our country, in the first place in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous incumbency party pri was superseded in 2000, vicente fox.
Congressman olvera acknowledges that after his 12 summer absence in the presidential palace los pinos party has high hopes for enrique peña nieto.
In addition, he denied the charges in the empty, which brought a new president of the opposition.
He's very candid and very dedicated incarnation of his vision of the country's future.
It's an excellent statesman, and, above all, the person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state of many people have developed a different view of the former governor.
Municipality nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of ciudad, is the stark contrast with paved streets valle.
Hidden under the overpass highways, he is in many ways, a suburb of mexico city.
And the problems in the municipality also wear dour character of this city.
Earlier this year for the suppression of gangs, selling drugs in these areas were invited to troops; and violence against women is here particularly acute.
In a vacant lot near a vast landfill only in the past two years, was discovered several dozens of bodies of dead women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of mexico city during the governorship of mr peña nieto is significantly higher than a similar rate in the sad glorify violence ciudad juarez, mexico, the name of which became a household, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of mr peña nieto about him in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of the killing of women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of complete disregard for this problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this ramshackle area irenei buendía struggle to hold back tears, showing me photos of his late daughter mariana moon.
According to the official version of the mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her inmate.
``When i reached her home, it seemed that her body before it was cleaned, ''recalls ms. buendía.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body is already pretty fresh.
The mother of mariana tells this story, and a portrait of daughter looking at us from the wall, where he hangs near the crucifixion, in which high one word: justice.
In this, they said, was denied this family.
``Officials in the state treated me as with the old gossip, disgust and troublemakers.
They want people just have to believe everything they say, and silent.
But it's wrong, you can not do that, especially when there is so much violations and weaknesses, ''she said.
Wearing the presidential sash on saturday, president of peña nieto together with her assumes a responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in mexico on crimes, connected with the violence, and the new president promised to make this solution is a priority during his reign.
``I hope that he will be exactly the same president, what was the governor, ''says olvera, congressman from valle pri.
However, this is what is most wary of the victims' families in ciudad.
Bradley manning not complained of mistreatment, said the prosecution.
Prosecutors are trying to refute the claims of bradley manning about poor conditions of detention.
During a hearing a great attention was paid to stay manning in the military prison at quantico, virginia.
Protection requires to close the deal on the basis that the terms of manning were brutal.
The us army private accused of kidnapping of several thousands of secret documents.
On friday, the prosecution attempted to prove that private bradley manning, accused of the largest leaks of classified materials in the history of the us, not used a lot of opportunities to file a complaint on abuse, which, he says, he had to move in the military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in fort meade, maryland, military prosecutor major эшден fein said that the weekly visits to manning's representatives of the administration in prison for nine months of his detention in quantico, virginia, do not contain complaints of abuse.
Cross-examining within the framework of the defence motion to dismiss the case manning on the grounds that the conditions of his conclusions were cruel and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held on the next day after manning said that in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
Military specialist on the analysis of the intelligence, who was arrested in june 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousands of secret documents while serving in iraq.
These materials were subsequently published online on the website wikileaks.
Resource wikileaks has not confirmed that the source of information was manning.
During a hearing on friday, the prosecutor fein together with manning reviewed reports that were to be completed after visiting manning representatives of the administration during his tenure at the quantico prison, where he was on the strict regime detention since july 2010 to april 2011.
During his visits to prison officials asked manning questions and recorded his responses.
When the prosecutor fein asked friday about reports, manning acknowledged that assesses the appeal to themselves in the prison administration as ``excellent '', and the general terms as`` very professional organizations.''
The reports do not contain complaints of abuse, despite the fact that manning directly asked about the terms of its content, fein said.
Manning replied that he expressed concern about these oral problem, and that interaction with his administration officials discussed with him these problems and stated that they will be, but not recorded it in writing.
``They recorded`` problems of absence ''(after discussion of my complaints), but it does not mean that i did not raise this issue in a conversation,'' said manning.
Military judge, colonel denise lind, also asked manning, why he never complained about ill-treatment with him in january 2011 during a meeting of the commission considers suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Manning replied that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that he was acquitted of the ``prevention of injury ''and cushioned the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited mode - on a level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the safety of others.
``I wanted to give the administration to know that i am fine, that they end the prevention of injury... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view, ''said manning.
On thursday, manning testified about his arrest in iraq and kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to prison at the naval base in quantico, virginia in july 2010.
He said that the thoughts about suicide appeared at him in kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of strong heat.
He explained that psychologically, it is very difficult when you do not know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outer world.
``My world have become shriveled to the base кэмп-арифжан, to the size of my prison, ''said manning on thursday.
 ``I thought i was going to die in this cage. ''
While in quantico, manning said he spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattress, blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He said that he had already tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime banned from the rules.
According to manning during sleep in his eyes constantly hit the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards have not seen his face when he as in bed at night, then, he said his budili and forced to turn on the back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection regarding mistreated with manning in january 2011.
In april 2011 manning was transferred to the military prison in fort lauderdale, kansas.
In addition, on friday, the judge questioned manning the statement, which he did during the testimony on thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at quantico, it was forced to stand naked before the guards and other inmates at a morning inspection.
Manning stated that he did not have the opportunity to cover a blanket during the inspection.
Answering the questions of a judge on friday, manning said that he understood from the order of the security guard that must throw blanket, which could claim the mantle, but admitted that no one does not directly ordered him to leave him.
On thursday, manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he poses no danger to myself.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use elastic cowards or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, according to the manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will take heed of the fact that he had to survive during detention, and substantially reduce prison sentence, in the case, if manning is found guilty military court, which is supposed to begin consideration of his case in the beginning of next year.
Protection announced plans to offer manning to recognize the blame for less serious crimes and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearing is scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention were acquitted.
The pentagon argues that manning was held at quantico in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the strict regime.
Among the charges manning were aiding the enemy, unlawful promotion of the publication of data on the internet, the transmission of information pertaining to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he will be convicted on all counts indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis national self-determination - an american story of mexican descent.
According to the author, many mexicans were forced to flee mexico for a lack of capacity to fulfill themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of a country about the difficult time.
Ruben navarea believes that latin american descent, torn between the two cultures.
During the recent trip to mexico i walked through the corridor, approached the border control and remained in place.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for mexicanos (mexico), the second for extranet (foreign).
A few seconds i stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central california, and my whole life called mexican.
It's just a name, just as my friends in boston call themselves the irish, and friends from new york regard themselves as italians.
Later, i stopped on a complex design ``an american of mexican descent. ''
But here i was in mexico.
Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional name and complex constructions.
I was just an american.
I speak well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the native language, and i can not get rid of the american accent.
Because i pulled out his american passport and began to turn for the extranet.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected mexican president enrique peña nieto visited the white house and met with president obama.
On the agenda were the usual meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president of peña nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the mexican economy, whereby mexicans now, with the same success will be able to stay in mexico, instead, to move in the united states.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the united states and canada and create a north american trade bloc like the european union.
In addition, the president of peña nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in mexico, but no specific proposals did not sound.
For mexico's relationship with the united states is heavy and full of old grudges question.
Most americans have never thought about that in the beginning of the year, the united states invaded mexico with shotguns and rifles forced its leaders to abandon the half of its territory.
But mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
It is only a statesman us mention any word criticism in the direction of mexico, in the press and among the elite mexican society was immediately given complaints that the americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And descendants of montezuma violent militancy.
The most complicated relationships are mexico with more than 35 million americans of mexican descent living in the united states.
Do you want to talk about insults?
Them enough.
In mexico have winners and losers, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and those for whom such capability is not present.
In los angeles, las vegas, phoenix, denver or san antonio so many people of mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize himself in mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Often it was a certain type of mexicans - the invasion of education, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
In mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the american dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is american, and not mexican.
Our national self-determination confusing and unclear, but we know what to believe their country.
The united states of america.
Besides we know that the majority of representatives of mexican elites and the ruling class does not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder about humiliating defeat and treat us like a formof second-class status as an inauthentic mexico.
We are not talking in spanish, and our relations with mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in mexico, they would not leave.
We would not be now for the silk curtain, found in the us state life, but lost spiritual connection.
My wife was born in guadalajara and legally moved in the united states, even in childhood, and it reminds me that between mexican americans and mexican descent, there are certain tensions - mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the americans of mexican descent is a shame.
She's the us citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar americans of mexican descent do not feel belong to any one of them.
We listen to the mexican group los tigres del norte, but love and bruce springsteen.
Receiving the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In mexico we americans.
And in the usa, we are called the mexicans.
Now, as i discovered during my trip, like our relationship without enough muddled, some mexican leaders and representatives of intelligentsia want to rebuild relations with the diaspora.
They want americans of mexican descent worked as a kind of ambassadors of mexico and represented its interests in the united states.
We could tell your friends about what it's a great country and how great her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It does not work.
Too much offense in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country is so beautiful.
I am sorry, but deal with themselves, amigos.
And rightly so.
If part of mexicans still can not forgive the united states what they did with mexico and a half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some americans of mexican descent still complain for the way recently in mexico were treated with their families.
Yeah.
Perhaps, we have more in common than i thought.
The old battle on the new middle east
The ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas can become a fragile foundation for further world
It might be a long-term peace between arabs and israelis in the middle east?
The next round of the bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
Sound traditional, senseless disputes about who started; lots of buildings reduced to rubble; killed more than 140 palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of israel's tel aviv and the holy city of jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the israelis and palestinians hopelessly entangled in his eternal conflict, the middle east came change.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the ``arab spring ''dizzy in the rebellious storm of many established realities, and the palestinians with israel not managed to stay in the side of the vortex, amazing region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on november 21, will be performed on this week clash only strengthened the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the islamist movement hamas, which came to power in gaza in 2007, expressed from the fact that they forced israel to withdraw, despite the incurred loss.
Despite the fact that certain leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, israel has failed to destroy hamas.
In fact, hamas intensified its popularity in the west bank - another palestinian territory controlled by currently more moderate fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of hamas may well conclude that the time working for them.
With the growth of the influence of islamist movements in the arab world, hamas appear new powerful and rich friends.
Resurgent regional leader of turkey, which was once the closest ally israel among the muslim world, performed with the support of hamas; it followed the example of qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the persian gulf.
The victorious hamas supporters claim about creating around israel of the islamist movement - from lebanon in the north, in which government paramilitary group hezbollah, syria, in a pro-islamic rebels to overthrow the power of bashar assad, and further to jordan, where the government of the king is threatened by allies of hamas.
As a significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern borders of israel, in the most populous and important arab country, in egypt, where president mohamed morsi has the impact of the muslim brotherhood.
Hosni mubarak, who ruled egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictatorship, not уделявшим special attention to the support of hamas.
The muslim brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization, in many respects similar with hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populist.
In the future diplomatic broke hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even israel and america.
At the same time, the supporters of the ``hard ''line in israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense hamas was defeated.
The israeli anti-missile system ``iron dome ''justified costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of started hamas missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the us remained faithful to his unchanging positions; many european countries also faulted for the beginning of the last round of violence on hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity in israel, especially with the government of binyamin netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that from 2004, approximately 30 israelis were killed by rockets fired from gaza, israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by the wall that comes on the territory of the west bank - a significant part of the unrecognized palestinian state - and protects the jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of prime minister netanyahu, whose party likud is in preparation for scheduled for january 22 election teamed up with even more offensive minded conservatives led by avigdor lieberman's very convenient.
What's the point of pandering to the palestinians and give them their own country?
If to give into the hands of all power in the territory of the west bank, not whether they will run out of missiles at israel, as it is done by their kin in gaza?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise your head.
Perhaps, the supporters of the ``hard ''line victorious; but their calculations may be refuted the arab spring.
Despite the fact that islamists who come to power in egypt and other countries, are not very fond of israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Defense budget israel more than all of its arab neighbors, put together.
The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of arab countries to strengthen our own economy.
Pragmatism president of egypt, morsi, who co-starred with barack obama worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of the change.
Israel, not least, should consider a long-term impact of their policies.
As the democratic change in arab countries, deprived of the palestinian right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later will explode in the israeli occupied territories, like a bus exploded in tel aviv on this week.
Repression already undermines democratic order in the jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operation, which is held every few years on the territory of gaza for the suppression of hamas, must pay the growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need outside momentum
It remains the only solution that tirelessly calls sane representatives on both sides, but also a large part of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and concessions from israel in exchange for the safety.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, ''the hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries efficiently influence on the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which we have to make a decision to cut off supplies of weapons into gaza, as well as turkey and qatar have, as ever, advantageous position to convince hamas recognize the jewish state, taken in 1967, with the exchange of territories and the sharing of jerusalem.
Other arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation between hamas and fatah.
That would make more for the creation of a palestinian state, than the vote in the un, the result of which can be a recognition of a palestinian state.
Their role is to engage israel at the negotiating table, is expected to play and president obama.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the white house, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to a resolution of this problem.
A disastrous short-sighted position.
The united states of vital interest in stability in the middle east.
It is possible only in the case of the peace agreement between israel and the palestinians.
In australia has entered into force of law on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and images of the disease of body parts contrasts allocated on damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same box of sceptical colors with gruesome photographs of affected body parts and images of children, whose health smoking undermined by their parents.
In addition to different images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the bundle, introduced in a compulsory manner with this saturday - the name brands, which are printed on the fine print.
This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of australia claims that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the bad habit of fashionable status.
At the heart of this decision on the results of research, showed that those who do not started smoking before 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers.
``It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning that is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of packaging, ''explains health minister tanya плиберсек, citing studies show that, for example, the crown in the logo of children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adoption of such measures are already considering and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry hard against the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
``This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiative, ''said scott mcintyre, a spokesman for the british american tobacco in australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from china and indonesia will supply a lot more of these goods for sale on the streets of australia.
For someone on the contrary, the new laws increase business.
Sandra ha from a small family company zico import pty ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as british american tobacco, the british imperial tobacco, philip morris and japan tobacco lost the case in the high court in australia, where he tried to appeal against the law.
According to sandra ha, the company zico already implemented around six thousand products enterprises wholesale trade and expects the new party.
For us it's a good business.
A potential obstacle for the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among the right part of the population, in which direction these measures.
After the adoption in australia of several laws that have made illegal television advertising cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sell cigarettes in a visible place, advertising for tobacco has shifted to the internet.
The australian government banned local companies and websites to advertise in the network, but it can not limit in this foreign sites.
``If you trade tobacco and you have only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods in the internet feels very tempting, ''says becky freeman, research questions of public health at the university of sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews for trademarks, written on behalf of alleged ordinary users, in such social networking sites like youtube, twitter and facebook.
The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen who loves marlboro cigarettes, what did not spare time and energy and made a video, or behind this ad campaign?
Australian department of british american tobacco argues that in the industry is now more busy adaptation to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsorship of ukraine, honduras and dominican republic to contest the new rules: these state claims in the world trade organization, declaring that trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations all these countries with australia are poor.
The decision of the wto is expected by the middle of 2013.
According to tani плиберсек, the government has discussed with other countries of the possibility of adoption of similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, the first canada imposed compulsory photos, warning about the hazards of smoking.
Now it's generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including brazil, turkey and ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws are considered in the uk, new zealand, south africa and india.
Many smokers in australia ostentatiously not obey innovation.
These pictures me not graze.
I just do not pay attention.
``Just snatched a cigarette and keeping pack in your pocket, ''explains viktor el haig, buying cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor mouth on a stack.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me leave - this is my little daughter.
James йу, head shop tobacco king of the pack in the heart of sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task ordering goods on shelves
``Before i got the unloading of a new party left an hour, and now four hours, ''he complains.
``The government needed to take and ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, okay, it's over, locking down the store, ''he says, raising his hands up.
Miss in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection is not so bad.
In this thanksgiving, i suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our aircraft were found a mechanical malfunction and be replaced by another plane, which we are pending.
Thus, i have had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight - it's really boring, and it's not much to help no books or magazines, nor the iphone, nor even duty-free.
But lately it's more scientists and experts on child development argue in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and our children will miss not so bad.
It forces the brain to focus on interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.
And since the modern world, we are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time.
We will come back to it.
Before i, like many others, thought that bore - the invention of relatively recent times, when people have appeared more free time.
It is not so, says peter tui, a professor of greek and roman history of the canadian university of calgary, the author of ``fascinating history boredom ''(boredom: a lively history, yale university press, 2011).
``Actually bore boasts a very ancient history, ''he says.
On the walls in pompeii discovered latin inscription about boredom, dating back to the first century.
This remains an open question, as we understand boredom.
The problem is, says john d. eastwood, an associate professor at the university of york in ontario, canada, understanding and vision of boredom often changes.
By studying the research materials on this topic and set the target group in 100 people, a professor of eastwood and his colleagues came to the next definition: boredom is when people want, but can not do anything to bring them to satisfaction. ''
The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, is that people do not bored doing something that i would like to do.
The apathy nothing to do not want to do.
The present boredom, ''he says, ``it's a violation of attention and associated with this deterioration in sentiment and a feeling that time goes slow.''
The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, professor eastwood argues that despite a possible connection between these conditions, miss people see causes of the problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when in fact, we would be hard to focus on something.
In his study ``unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, ''published in september issue of the journal perspectives on psychological science, professor of eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the tv shows-commercials included in the next room, others heard these sounds at a low volume, so that they hardly could understand, and a third group only listened to a recording of the voice without any sound track.
Those participants who heard tv with a low volume, noted that they were bored, are more likely than others - they found it difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons behind it, and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption coverage can cause weariness, ''says mark j. фенске, an associate professor of neurology at the university of guelphs, ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, ``for example, peering into the flow of the products in the line in the search for marriage deflects music can help avoid boredom. ''
As he continues, that when people start swaying on a chair or paint scribbled on a sheet of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that the fact that such action just helps not relax physically.
``The study found that children who do not forbid fidget and twisting, learn better and more information than children, from which require sit tight, ''said professor фенске.
In any moments we are all feeling of boredom: in the event of a delay in flight (as in my case), listening to drone on browsing the uninteresting kind film.
However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers developed a special ``scale propensity for boredom. ''
For valuation on such a scale used questions and, for example, ``a lot from the fact that i have to do, monotonous and dull ''or`` i am too much interesting, so no matter what does not have enough time.''
With the help of such research determined that the boys miss often girls, ''said stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the university of western florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, the general teenagers do often bored.
In 1991, reed larson, a professor of personal and social development at the university of illinois, conducted the experiment, during which he contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of adolescents announced that they get bored at school and during the implementation of the homework, and 23% reported that they get bored outside the school.
While only 3% of parents noted that they get bored.
Professor larson notes that he has no data about what would have been similar data about boredom, now 21 years later.
However, he knows that ``the adolescent peak propensity for boredom '', largely because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully solve than sex.
Back to my original question: boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in the margins of it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in an effort to relieve boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says professor воданович dedicated study this problem more than two decades.
``Our brain tells us that we should do something different; that is boredom, ''says gary marcus, professor of psychology at new york university.
However, the brain does not always know exactly what is it better to do.
If you are going to be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make myself.
However, if you become a tv, you will feel better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
However, if your child misses and you give him the ipad, it would not miss you, but he did not learn to fight boredom independently or in any way other way to manage your time and employment, ''said professor фенске.
``And skills such self-regulatory uses a variety of situations, ''he said.
Your child learns not only to take something, he also learns self-confessed control at all.
I do not think boredom to praise.
However, regard it as a bad time, too, should not be.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor eastwood agree with it.
``We see so that we need often experience boredom, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful, ''he says.
In fact, people tend to distract from the permanent concerns and just relax.
``In the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulus senses, ''he says,`` and when silence, we lose and we do not know what to do.''
It is unclear how to apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in colorado
Anthony orozco, the nineteen-year player of the football team and community college students in the southeast colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, essentially, they are going to be quite legitimately throughout the state: a small portion of marijuana and a tube, in which he smoked.
Mr orozco says that one day in september he was with friends in ламаре and driving in the car on the prairie near the border with kansas, when they had been stopped.
After a police officer discovered in the car marijuana, mr orozco came a summons for possession of drugs and possession of a device for drug - misdemeanors, for each of which are due to a fine of $100 - and date of the court session.
``With us treated as criminals, ''says mr orozco.
But crime if he?
As a result of uncertainty, which have persisted for several weeks after the colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of the hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law, as on the place.
Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already filmed in hundreds of cases, and here in washington state, which adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped indicted people at the age of 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be seen as legitimate, once in a couple of weeks of the law will enter into force.
However, in a conservative districts of colorado prosecutors decided to examine existing matters associated with marijuana, and still attract to account for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from suburban denver to the mountains of the west to vote for it to prevent the emergence in their new places, licensed state stores for the sale of marijuana.
``It is growing so fast that i do not even know what to expect further, ''said daniel j. oates, the chief of police in the town of aurora in the east of denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in washington state, also puzzled scratch your head.
They are to form the rules to determine the order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all you need to do before december 1, 2013.
They say that colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
In colorado over an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example, ''explains brian e. smith, a representative of the council on the regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages in washington state.
But now no one can do more, admits mr smith than put forward any proposals and hope that it would work.
``We have no real precedent, on which we could navigate, ''he said.
Bill washington state i-502 called, will enter into force on december 6, and the whole year plunging state in the state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing still present, and the ownership of marijuana is legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects, which must be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state about ``adequate access ''to your licensed marijuana from a ban on trade it within 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
``It's particularly difficult to place licensed vendors marijuana in the inner cities, in particular in seattle, and its suburbs, ''explains ben livingston, a representative of the newly established research group center for the legalization of marijuana.''
On november 21, the police chief oates from aurora pitched his subordinates from an e-mail message that city prosecutors will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that police stops уличать people in these violations since this moment. ''
Police chief oates said that the police will monitor the compliance in the city of rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and drugs.
The district attorney weld on the north of colorado, ken buck, represents a strict approach to this issue.
After the vote of the draft bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to bring to trial for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its use of a course of treatment.
At the moment of 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused in other violations.
``The duty of our institution to persecute for actions that are considered crimes in the time they were committed, ''said mr buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like rural district mesa, where the voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in grand junction, the country's largest city in the county, no longer attracts the responsible adult for possession of a small amount of the drug.
The district attorney pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to shoot charges on already open cases connected with the storage of marijuana.
``I believe that enforce the law until he will not change our direct duty, ''he says.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of residents of colorado, participated in the ballot supported that decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.
And the confused reaction residents in various locations around the state has revealed the ambiguity relations between the local authorities to participate in the state with marijuana.
``The prosecution in this regard, there is a cultural barrier, ''explains sean mccallister, denver, a lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the national organization for reform laws on marijuana.
``They are so long persecuted people for it, that it can not really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime, ''he says.
Colorado and washington - the first states in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the scope of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalisation and state officials plan to expand the territory of the legalization of trade, but at the same time, they fear waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalizing marijuana hope that the department of justice to this issue.
Despite several have received wide resonance arrests of traders and patients, using marijuana for medical indications, the federal government in most cases were approved on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in colorado, washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the bureau of narcotics are unlikely to be at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become a blind eye on regulated state authorities shops recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, ''said kevin a. sabet, a former adviser in the struggle with drugs in the obama administration.
Some cities in colorado were not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on opening new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so could not open sooner than a year.
Last week, montrose, city in the western part of the state, nominated for the consideration of the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved next week.
``We do not want to be in a position that we will issue someone license, and then it would cause serious problems at the federal level, ''says bob nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a clear contradiction between the results of the local voting and voted for that state.
There is still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella уайэтт: i survived from oxford for the fact that i am a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
How much i can remember, i have always wanted to do to oxford university.
My father and brother went to oxford and described him as the best in the world institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, the two foundations of civilization, freedom and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of training on the history department of worcester college, oxford university in the late eighties, i packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not endure and cry.
Friends were confused.
The evening standard argued that i dropped out of college, because i do not like what my fellow students have sex in the next room.
Writer, e. e. norman wilson joked that i left because i had to drink from shcherbatykh cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, she ran off, because i systematically hounded and intimidated.
It's not because of my pretty unusual name or the fact that i attended a private school.
I was the only reason, and in this renowned cradle of the light it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late woodrow уайэтт, was a famous advisor margaret thatcher, and i was on the side of the conservatives.
You ask why to reminisce about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, follows centre-right views, is the same harassment.
This institute and constantly growing hatred of students at oxford is so strong that last week, a group of these students demanded the same protection of their rights, as the one that is available for the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the students' club in corpus christi college in cambridge, claiming that their ``often actively isolated expose personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests ''because of their political views.
They want to enter in the committee on equal rights of college alternate representative, to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation only exacerbated recently released on the bbc 2 documentary about politics in the country of miracles: young, smart and right, ''in which conservative eccentric and neo-nazis.
In the film was shown joe cooke, a former president of the association of conservatives at oxford university, who travels in rolls-royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with silver bedknobs.
In other university students complain that they make ``scapegoats to an increase in school fees. ''
Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the association of conservative nottingham university, in an interview with one of the sunday newspapers, said, ``at a university increases skew toward the left.
People that we do not even know in advance to be bold and with impunity of lush children of rich parents. ''
Samuel roberts, 21, a student of history faculty college in corpus christi, which was filed a petition on strengthening the protection, calls this atmosphere of ``uncomfortable '', and stephanie черилл, 19 years, the new president of the association of conservatives at oxford university, says that the ratio of members of the student club to the centre-right views dramatically worsened.
``This represents a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for normal life club members, ''she said.
The first few weeks in oxford, i was not just in the minority, i was alone.
I got there in september 1986, timid and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford fever from hatred of the conservative party.
A year before this university vote deprived former student of margaret thatcher of her honorary degree because of budget cuts on higher education.
In this atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even stalin.
In the first days of the week freshman, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time i felt that what awaited me ahead.
I did not know that teachers do not only a blind eye to badger students, but also gladly took part in it.
Political questions - the miners' strike, privatization and discontent of the government of sanctions against the government of apartheid in south africa - seeped through trimmed with wood panelling wall audiences.
On my first seminar i needed to translate french text of the eighteenth century in english, and i was not ready for the fact that followed it.
``Miss уайэтт, ''said a teacher, the late harry pitt,'' please put the first paragraph. ''
The text gave me with difficulty, i hesitated.
Harry pitt was very bitter man with the face like a cake.
``Thatcher did not fundamentally taught french or they just did not have enough brains? ''he asked.
Other students laugh.
I have in front of tears.
``Suggest you take a few primary lessons of the french in his spare time, if you are, of course, it is not very busy, rotating in society, ''пробрюзжал pitt.
I am back in your room is miserable.
In the evening in college, i sat at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was james, second-year student in the english language, who introduced himself as a member of the association of conservative university.
``I know who you are, ''he said kindly.
 ``Unfortunately, the law is as follows:
Over every, who is suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives, will be scoffing.
I can not be easy, and in your case, they know that your father close to margaret thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
The majority of first-class pretend that they are labour. ''
Later, at the local pub, i am too cowardly to hypocrisy.
I insisted that it did not agree with everything, says margaret thatcher.
The trick failed.
Freshman of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who studied at eton, said: ``you are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious. ''
Other students picked up his words.
I was flawed, dirty.
``As conservatives have sex? ''asked one of them.
 ``They beat each other, right? ''
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals before the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the sixties.
If i can ever live a normal life in oxford?
Or i will have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
If i am going to be forced to become labour and hide their real persuasion?
I three years has come to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not hide their conservative views, was norman stone, a professor of modern history.
He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to thatcher on foreign policy issues and one of its speechwriters.
In college, he has not returned.
He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the marxist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship in post, bilkent university, ankara, turkey.
``Here you would not be happy, ''he told me.
I travelled to oxford from the parental home in london, trying to find a refuge among relatives and impartial metropolitan friends.
I told my father that i hate oxford and explanation.
He did not believe me.
During his studies in the forties there were any political views.
``But it's the best university in the world, ''he said plaintively.
 ``There is not capable, only not in the city of dreaming spires.
Even my friends always behaved impeccably. ''
His moist eyes blurred.
``Do not take any hasty decisions.
I am sure it's just a joke.
You crush my heart, if you drop university. ''
I was exhausted regular trips to london and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also conservative, could not bear the pressure and abandoned its belief.
Next week during the seminar, when the history teacher completely serious called me ``the enemy of the people, ''i decided to do the same thing.
In the shower burning from shame, i confess that i had brainwashed parents, ''and called them ``old fools.''
Reprieve was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time, he wrote every week for two columns for publications owned by rupert murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not appear, and after five minutes my haunting surrendered.
When they left, i packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to london.
I never came back.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should not become a target of this anger and intimidation in educational institutions.
The sad that it was oxford, which is not only released fourteen tory prime ministers, but also to this day behind the undeserved reputation university, in which value equality and freedom.

The most challenging profession in the world: miners with кавах-иджена
For four euro indonesian miners are risking their lives and health, it was 70 kilograms of sulfur on the top of the steep rocky road
There are people, for which their job is hell, but other literally work in hell.
Among them анто widjaja, one of the 400 miners who earn a living prey sulfur in the vulcan кавах-иджен, located on the east of the indonesian island of java.
Every day анто descend into the very bottom of the crater, where sulphur dioxide gas, rising from the depths of the earth, freezes in contact with air.
Breakaway huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which may reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, baskets piled on the shoulders and carries them up the precipitous rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, and the height is 2.386 meters, only 250 metres, but weary movers require more than 40 minutes to get a snail's pace, with difficulty restraining balance and carefully fumble road, not to fail and not fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost of their lives, as it happened with one tourists from france, which slipped a few years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.
Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 cents for every additional kilogram of sulphur mined
Once at the top, they pave a road between tourists who photographed them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy crates, march three kilometers before weights mining company is slightly higher at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
We are talking about the pt kandy нгримби enterprises, which operates since 1960 this volcano, and better and not to say their employees, which it pays 662 indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical production, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamic and even for the bleaching of sugar.
``As the norm is papoose 70 kilograms, we generate about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every ходку, ''explains us анто, which usually carries out three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels crushed, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euro) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be мизером for such a tremendous effort, it is three times as much that he would have earned in the field.
``Daily fee miners is very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average wages is equal to two million rupees (167 euros), ''explains stevedore, who previously worked as a bricklayer in tourist island of bali.
There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the plot was not so hard, but анто returned with his family in баньюванги, town not far from the volcano, had good reason, which in indonesia is the same shattering, as sylph: ``i married a girl with the bali, where some hindus, and brought her to java, she had converted to islam. ''
The анто asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and have it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases
In my 27 years анто spent three years, the risk of a кавах-иджене, sulfur which has already started to reverberate despite the availability of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and have it (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases, which selects the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dreams.
``Work for another two years, because i want to open a shop or explore the french or spanish, ''he promises on more than acceptable english.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or bellhop in hotel, but instead he performs the mule.
I share the dirty wooden hut with the other, he rises every day at 2am, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and shiny among the gloom.
Challenging the shadows, the анто descends to the crater, highlighting the small lantern, connected to his helmet, which he bought himself with your money.
About 400 porters drag basket with gray hair on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high levels of profit mining company not mechanized the extraction sulphur for savings and does not provide any equipment porter, who work on his own account, and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even get part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for shooting, which, along with the input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve is charged with tourists who come to snap a picture of a volcano and his men.
``This work for cattle, and not for people, ''says бадрусин, stocky summited 42 years, which spent on кавах-иджене three decades, since i left college.
The ability to raise up to 110 pounds, he argues, will tolerate job ``for as long as it can, ''because he needs the money for education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years.
Not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense pillars of smoke, out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains on my heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, arthrosis, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which deforms under the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on the back, now only унайник can raise 50 kilogram in their 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three cargo at a warehouse in taman, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow path in the bush.
``I do not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life, ''says унайник, widely opening your mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
From his five children, senior, 30 years, also works carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most difficult lessons in the world: what human mules with кавах-иджена.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
``The population of singapore to grow. ''
I am the husband patriot, you are my spouse patriotism, honor our civic duty and create a life!
It might seem improbable that these lines are part of the advertising мятных bread, however, despite this - or perhaps this is a video became a hit on youtube in singapore in the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local saying like ``let's put bao (bulku) in the oven to mock birth rates in singapore.
Advertising agency, which has made this video, bbh was to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they would draw attention to this problem in the entertainment form.
His creative director, douglas hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music that people performed ``a national debt ''.
This thing exclusively for the internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
It's a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world for the continuation of their own kind, so we felt that this is the subject of which we must address.
We knew that the government has a lot of things to do, for example, launch spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (quick message form).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily work.
So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 children
Who do not take it so recklessly, so it's the government of singapore.
It is spending $1,300 a year on the policy of enthusiasm for citizens to the birth of a greater number of children.
The package for couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But it has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state in southeast asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his stern public control.
The birthrate in singapore, in accordance with its national management by population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why singaporeans do not have a greater number of children?
Tang wei ming, director of the policy for couples and families of the population, says that the reason for this ``improved education ''and`` a wide range of career opportunities.''
``It enabled people to have a wide range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of the family, ''she explains.
These changes of social norms boosted the number of bachelor and postponing marriage and birth of her children, resulting in reduced fertility rates in singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront a reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.
In singapore has web sites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in relation to many new immigrants, particularly chinese, which is criticized for the maintenance of wages at a low level, and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one reason that in the past year, the ruling party singapore got the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The unintended consequences
While falling fertility has known effects on economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, it is an example of singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The government strives to not has been so much of a small housing.
For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate industry.
Guidance on urban development has been transferred to the control of the number of apartments, known as the ``shoe box ''that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments 46 square meters very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote bachelor lifestyle and deprive incentive developers who want to build a large family homes.
But lim yu sun, the director general of the construction firm el developers said they ``boxes of shoes ''sold much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments greater size.
As a result, our cash flow is increasing.
Nevertheless, he concedes that new rules give clearer guidance for developers, which before were hurdles if they wanted to offer too many apartments in the project.
Too redirect
Singapore is the city-state.
While these new rules can be a step toward increasing national fertility, after his conversation with singapore, which operate in the fiscal quarter center, it seems that they will not have a special effect.
``People are very overstretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of that many people it delay, ''says a young manager.
Other people may have children.
``But it is important for me to have their own money and time, ''says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that make it hard for them to have children.
So, as if the government nor sought to encourage their citizens for the birth of children, in regard to procreate, the last word in singapore.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to a dictionary of the royal academy of the spanish language, we are talking about the private property or ``sphere of personal life, which have the right to protect from any interference. ''
What is personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and social networking sites?
Does he understand the danger of being in a discussion on the internet situation, which will not be shared outside of the internet?
Interview elperiódico took five guys from ten to 15 years, frequent network users.
In four cases, they are associated with the term ``something '', in my personal plane, and`` password and username'' when he used his access to social networks.
``My biggest secrets i would not be downloaded in the post, ''says a decade of jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like facebook, twitter, hotmail, and windows live messenger, where he has accounts for the past two years.
``It's secretary, my mother can know them, but not the whole world, ''he said.
On fb i load beautiful pictures or images from the games.
I also have fun with friends.
``I would not share the photo, which is not mine, or someone acts stupid, ''he said.
The boy understands that bad publishing obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends who have him in fb, and its nine фолловеров on twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother in the know, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I have a twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
``I do not know, meet me, i am just download them, ''he adds.
``Social networking is fun, i can talk with distant relatives or with his friends quickly, ''he says.
Without hesitation, replies that never would have a request from an unknown person.
He would not be with someone who would recommend that a stranger.
The case of a 14-year-old jose is different.
This teenager have open accounts on hotmail, facebook, my space and ask, and in the last admits that she did not know about 20 people, added to his list of friends.
``It does not scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example, ''he says.
According to the boy, no one to milkmen in confidence and asked for his home address or phone number.
``If i become pressure or demand, just remove them from your account, ''he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading recommendations on twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience that today is known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friends blackmailed in the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
``He did not know who it was, ''he says.
The victim, according to jose, not deleted account.
``Only included confidentiality ''.
He then explains the sequence of steps for the account settings safe way.
Unlike jorge, this boy uploaded photos would be familiar uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, i'd do it, if the person i do not like it or if i want to.
``Although i know that it's cyberbullying, ''he confirms.
Key questions
Marielle porras, english teacher and an expert on education and training, believes that to guide the children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks - information.
``The internet appeared as a means for information search, but with the arrival of these sites have changed the rules of the game, ''she said.
Porras indicates that academician marc prensky, master pedagogy of yale university and author of digital natives and immigrants invented these terms for an explanation of this phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are the children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
``We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we still did we learn, ''she said.
Explains that this theme is complicated, ``because we ask them to have a certain criteria that you can or can not distribute, publish or speak at the age when maturity is not enough for it. ''
``Also that they were voters, while the most important things for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences, ''she adds.
According to a specialist, the most effective way to show that the confidentiality of children and adolescents, ask questions that make them think.
``Tell them that they do not do this, useless, ''she adds.
Then porras lists some of the options: there are things that you would not know a stranger, so why are you doing this on the internet?
Or would you like it, if published a picture of you like the one i published you about your friend?
If you know that other publications about you?
When you sign party photos, asking if you allow others to mark them?
And another, all whether you need to know what you are doing in every moment?
Another item is to give them to understand that they should behave online as doing it offline.
The rules of the same.
``Beyond the internet man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as it should be in the social networks, ''she said.
Vigilance
Estuary guardia, a college professor, professor of primary education and consultant in education, explains the need for family heads faithfully read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each points, they have good reason for interviews with children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the internet.
``For example, age, and what is permitted to distribute or publish, ''he said.
According to the guardia, a key question is to remind children lesson ``do not say with strangers. ''
Unasur summit ends without disclosure de lima declaration
Vi presidential summit of the union of south american nations (unasur) ended today in peru without disclosure de lima declaration, previously disclosed and theoretically signed family participants.
Efe repeatedly tried to get access to the document, signed at the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government unasur, however, sources of the office and the presidential administration pointed to the main page that his transfer after closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the website of the peruvian government.

Little information, that circulates among reporters were transferred to the press of some governments unasur, attending the meeting, but not peruvian.
The only document spread throughout the day, was a list of participating presidents, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the president of peru sent an e-mail message of the media with the final declaration of the summit, but it is about statement умалы, rather than the official document, which ended the summit.
Last october peru took iii summit of the south american and arab countries (aspa), and at that time, despite the fact that this insistence press was not spread so called the declaration of lima, which previously announced.
At the official website of the historians, you can check that the document was published in the last tuesday.

``Chile has been and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, covenants and international tribunals, ''added piñera, and welcomed squeeze hands умалу amid the flags of these two countries.
Confirmation by the two presidents of the fact that they will submit to an international court, was right after the colombia challenged this week боготский pact, according to which she was a confessed subordination of the verdict of the international court of justice after a decision about sea border with nicaragua, which she suggested mistaken.
The summit was held in the absence of brazilian president дилмы русеф; venezuela, hugo chavez; bolivia evo morales; and argentina, cristina kirchner.
Paraguay, membership in the unasur was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of his former president fernando lugo, was not involved in the meeting.

The need for latin america remained a region of prosperity and peace, would be united, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another subject, stressed at the summit.

``South america should learn from europe in the integration of citizenship '': rafael correa
The president of ecuador, rafael correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the aim, in which the south america, in this case, yes, you should learn from europe. ''
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the union of south american nations (unasur), held in lima, peru, state television said that europeans were killing each other during the second world war, ''and in other clashes,'' but now they are almost all fatherland. ''
He defended, in this context, the project of the establishment of the south american citizenship, which approve unasur countries.
``We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers on any south american country, as it is now happening with members of the andean community, but still have a reactionary sector who want to bring us back in the past, ''he warned.
The ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the organization of american states (oas) under a prerequisite to reduce the influence of the anglo-saxon countries and taking into account of those who signed the pact in san jose on human rights.
For those who read lectures, never do not assume any obligation, and we, south americans, on the contrary, sign it.
``Inexplicable that the inter-american commission on human rights in washington dc and financed by the united states, ''he said, hinting at a political asylum, ecuador, the wikileaks founder julian assange.
Correa assured that does not regret this decision, because with him he did not betray their principles, and comply with its ``profound values of democracy and human rights. ''
He added that in due time, there were a suspicion that assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed the process. ''
He criticized, in addition, the swedish justice for the requirement will arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged crimes of sexual violence, while the swedish legislation to implement it through videoconferencing, which could be done from the embassy of ecuador in london. ''
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health assange.
``I have not spoken with him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, it's not serious, ''said the ecuadorian head of state.
That there is indeed, it's the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of incarceration in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
``It affects the health of any person, ''he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution, granted assange asylum from june in the ecuadorian embassy in london, through the provision of guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to go in ecuador, lies in the hands of the uk, sweden, and european courts and stressed that talks were in london about finding a solution to the confines of the founder of wikileaks.
We are not negotiating about human rights, that word in this case, we do not use, but there were constant discussions.
``This problem is in the hands of the uk, sweden, and european courts because assange's lawyer, baltasar garson, leads a number of processes in different european authorities, ''he mentioned.
And expressed his opinion that ``if britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end. ''
And if sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and how she has done in other cases, questioning senor assange at the embassy of ecuador in london or interrogate him on the skype tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he would never tolerate ``mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression. ''
``The main enemies of press freedom is not corrupted villains, and bad journalists, supporting profits, blackmail and extortion, ''he said.
In this respect, he was satisfied that any of these journalists, bankers, nor the bourgeois countries not dominate in ecuador, ''and added that being reelected, ``deepening of the revolution to continue development in the right direction.''
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto of paraguay in the unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization should be solid and not tolerate opportunism and support under the guise of legality, ''because in reality,'' it shattered the legitimacy of the paraguayan democracy. ''
The ecuadorian president considers, in addition, a ``perfectly reasonable ''desire for his colleagues at columbia juan manuel santos to conduct negotiations with nicaragua on maritime boundary between the two countries after a decision by the international court of justice in the hague, which turned out to be in favor of nicaragua maritime sovereignty.
At the moment this decision is not observed.
It is a problem between south american and latin american countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together.
You need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good completion of a dispute about sea borders, which lead in the same court peru and chile, and said that ``the right thing for latin america in international instances, if the two countries undertake to adopt a decision, no matter how difficult it may be. ''
About the opportunity to present itself as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity with great optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard. ''
Correa assured that if the loses the election in february 2013, will depart from public life.
Personally, i have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in ecuador, social poverty can be fixed only from the political power.
``My political movement stated that i guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility, ''he said.
In the case of victory, it would be my last term as president, and then we go from public life.
If we lose, it is the same thing.
``This decision, ''he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of venezuelan president hugo chavez in cuba.
I just spoke with venezuelan vice-president nicolas maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which was already scheduled routine, and that it is expected that he will have to miss out on a campaign to return to cuba.
``It does not mean the escalation of the health of president hugo chavez, ''he explained.
The head of the ecuadorian state took part in lima in the vi summit of heads of state and government of the union of south american nations (unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration for the maintenance of progress, equality and security.
Deaths from aids today is the result of the late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that its analysis on aids gave a positive result.
``I am like you are frozen, ''he recalls the rough, despite all the time with a doctor, the moment.
The young man kept it from his family.
To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn about her as much as possible, and his efforts were fulfilled: he mentioned his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the ``elders ''patients hiv-negative hospital hospital civil de guadalajara (hcg), where he appeared in 1994, overcame many hurdles.
He lives with the diagnosis of ``the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) for 22 years. in the early 90s it would be hard to believe - too little existed treatment options, too little known about the disease, too biased attitude to the sick.
So, even the director of the mexican institute for social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, ''because he had cut.''
In other words, in those days have aids was sentence.
It is now possible to survive with hlhs and do it without aggravating the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when a virus already damaged, ''drained their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of aids in the world, at least after the first notified cases, ''is a great achievement at this time is that the survival of the patient, which starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same,'' said the head of the hiv-negative hcg, jaime andrade villanueva, citing the fact that this information confirms in april this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infection and expert on hiv / aids, andrade villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that aids is not a sentence, however duration and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available for patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy of those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 cd4, and up to 50 years, when informed about 500 cd4.
Simply put, this means that whoever gets diagnosed with hiv at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, ''support control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,'' he explained.
To evaluate this progress, we should remember that life expectancy mexicans today in an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in case of mexico, the number of people dying from aids fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report from unaids), it is also true that since the onset of aids, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in jalisco 255 people have died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by may this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 ``Why are you still have a lethal outcome?
 Personally i think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So i can imagine, so in our hospital.
At least the past 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know about their hiv status, i.&space;e., the later stages of the disease.
He brought devastating data: ``nine out of ten patients come when you already have some opportunistic infections; that you should do to exert greater influence on the overall mortality, so it's diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide an audition for detection in a massive scale, for all people, that it will be asked. ''
In its proposal opined experts and officials of the state council on the prevention of aids in jalisco (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like fabrizio, who turned to check into a private lab, motivated by only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of aids and even suffered kaposi's sarcoma, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
All changes when you know that you have aids.
Some people think to die, and do not want to know.
``Once all anyway, i will drink hard three times a week, ''they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, i am eating well, doing exercises, taking drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
``I work, i have a lot of lessons, i travel, i keep sexually active, but with the mutual responsibility, take care of myself and about the other person, ''listed fabrizio, who agreed to share your personal life with milenio jalisco, to prompt by those who now, in the context of the world aids day, is experiencing fear.
Let them check if it was the risk of infection, as soon as possible to know whether they are hiv-positive, it's better, and if they have already got the diagnosis, let him know that they can live like any other man, being responsible.
It's his message summarises the fight against aids in this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, ''said ricardo salazar, a journalist from guadalajara, which went into the problem with hiv.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places on this task, ''actually increased condom distribution, before they gave us one or two, now give us packages on guard, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still does not have access to condoms,'' he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
``Why do you? ''is a popular issue with ехидством and conviction, on the side of social workers, school consultants, employees, pharmacies and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured propagandist.
I propose to change this inefficient allocation; that condoms were not only for position and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that frequently visits the youth.
It's not encourage promiscuity.
We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor of emilio gonzalez, when he was asked that the distribution of condoms in its leadership.
``It's not sexy, best make condoms available to those who engage in sexual activity, ''he said.
The key data in jalisco
Registered (13,435 summary cases 12,158 aids and 1,317 hiv).
The state ranks 4th in national ranking in new and total cases of aids and the 13th on hiv.
92% of infections related to sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% by perinatal path.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with hiv, as the one known case from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.
Given the ratification of the court of appeal of the united states solution that terminates the debt restructuring group vitro, achieved through a competitive production in mexico, the script installs the fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country, which has some problems with solvency.
It seems that the procedures in support of survival firms, which allowed mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical sphere, approval of the decision on june 15 judge harlin hale in court bankruptcies of the northern district of texas, leaves threatened mexican firms in the face of the possibility of impounding on their property on the other side of the rio grande.
However, the ruling opens the door leading manufacturers of glass in mexico for treatment in the united states supreme court, resulting in a proof of three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge case notes that lenders should be governed by the code of the united states bankruptcy court of appeals for the fifth circuit, located in new orleans, says that the trial concerns of competitive manufacture, considered in mexico.
The first clause implies the cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, created by the model law of the un for the unification of international trade law, defined as an arbitrator of american law institute.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without inter-firm voting, recognized in the critical mass of competitive manufacture debt, which had before the parent company of vitro, would not be achieved by the majority required for approval of a restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize the mexican laws.
In fact, vitro was not the first time in this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including agrement and checking mexicana, whose inter-firm debts guaranteed the federal institute for competitive production.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, or otherwise vitro creditors, who fought against him in the courts of the united states, namely the funds ``vultures ''like aurelien capital, aurelia converter, elliot international and liverpool limited, have the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data to the court of appeal.
On the other hand, he blames vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, by a serious economic crisis, which is to strike the united states, stabbing their country.
Yet that the firm family gonzalez garden burden appeal in the court of appeals to the vote came to his plenary session, i.&space;e., five judges, due to the fact that the party only three.
In the case of failure will be charged with the application for certification, which will require a review process from the court of appeals, in this case the supreme court of the united states.
Worse yet, the court dismissed the document, directed by the mexican government in the role of uk intervenors (``friend ''), in the process, which should be vitro within the framework of the law on competition, signaling that he frees itself from the observance of the agreements signed by both countries, to tie her with article 15 of the law of the us bankruptcy.
In addition, notes that the country complied principles of the united nations commission on international trade, i.&space;e., the rules set for the cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for the debtors and creditors.
A lot from two boards: they hurt in vitro and beaten in the country.
The overall balance
Given deferred for a few months of complaints, posted on the table unions mexicana de quality against the former owner of the company, gaston аскаррага andrade, who is accused of cheating management unions association pilots airmen already found bottleneck.
Deliverance, led by carlos diaz chávez morino, only that the requirement of the criminal case against the national commission on banks and securities, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to that supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports in the general prosecutor of the republic of about operations by entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund f/589 bank ixe 198 million pesos, on behalf of mexicana airlines.
Resources would be directed to buy shares of professional management company hotels.
As you know, the аскаррага andrade is the main shareholder of the chain posadas.
The dragon mart
Meeting at the weekend at the forum in the caribbean university, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the common civil society welcomed the establishment of a broad front to confront the opening of the chinese dragon mart in cancun.
We speak, as you know, about a giant heart of the sale and distribution in mexico, central america and caribbean countries products isolated country, with a residential area near for the staff of 150 companies.
Previously canacintra managed to combine governors southeast zone to confront this monumental forces that are leveled part of protected areas and highlight serious threats against industry.
The death of acta
About denied government requirements of the senate to explain, under any conditions and circumstances of the ambassador of mexico in japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, known as an abbreviation for english acta, according to the mexican institute of industrial property, it already passed into the archive.

Hector ``hetin ''reyes:`` basketball was my life.''
An avid basketball traveler hector ``hetin ''reyes was more than 60 years to do with this sport, and thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in puerto rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories as hector ``hetin ''reyes.
And in fact before a brain haemorrhage chained to a wheelchair in 2008, reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, the player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and director of bsn with cowboys bayamón, puerto rico, and the president of basketball federation.
``I have done a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when i was the president of bsn, director general of the national team and the federation president in the 1990s, ''recalls reyes during the visit of the primera hora to his home in bayamón, puerto rico, where he lived with isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
``Basketball was my life. ''
Reyes not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and unforgettable things, collected for his long journey, show about it.
Bayamón, puerto rico in the heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the cowboys since the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when under the age of 15 years of his performance in the role of со-агента or agent of the contract.
``It was my prime, which i enjoyed the most, because i had the opportunity to be a part of eight championships cowboys since 1967, as an agent со-агента or supervisor.
It was many years of happiness, including five championships since 1971 to 1975.
And then i said goodbye to one in 1981, in the year debut jerome минси in bsn.
From that moment and continue to lead a ``cuco ''ortiz, who was a great administrator,'' said reyes.
I remember that gene bartow, germany, which was heading here and was at the university of alabama (birmingham), told me: ``i have a very strong player, the growth in the 6'7 ''.
``You want? ''
And it was the beginning of a минси, one of the best players, which have been in puerto rico.
Bar-tov then recommended sniper raymond gauss, who won the citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if минси brought championship bayamón, puerto rico, gauss helped to win another one.
Open cowboys with gaussian i enjoy, but already at a distance, because by 1988, already was head of the federation.
By the time i chose to enjoy his achievements and achievements минси on the national team.
I remember how we won in the first time, the united states during the olympic qualifying tournament in mexico in 1989.
Then came the world championships in 1990, on which we received a fourth place and this was supposed to be bronzes, if not the canadian judge, who made us with the final game, ''said reyes.
The team of the world championship in 1990, is the best team you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the 2004 olympics.
But my favorite was the one with pan american games in cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashing team, which was pretty similar to that we have won bronze at the world championship.
In the team not only again played минси, gauss, ramona rivas, fico lopez and'пикулина ''(ortiz), but also young (javier) 'тоньито 'colon and james carter, brothers leon (francisco and edgar) and mario'кихоте' morales, who could not participate in 90 year because of knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personal composition, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was a team of the olympic qualifying tournament in 1995, a protester argentina.
With role players like'канито ''nieves, pablo алисеа and young rolando хурруитнера instead of players, temporarily suspended for the disorder in panama championship mar del plata, we won gold in spite of all forecasts.
Who was the best player in puerto rico?
Without doubt, it was a pickle ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments.
No one in puerto rico not dominated at this level as it did pickle.
And it is without accounting of his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best puerto supervisor?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good youngsters, including julio toro, flora meléndez, carlos morales, raymond далмау, armando torres.
Among the young, i love the work of leo ариллы.
What do you think your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s bsn was up to 17 teams in the season.
What you need to do?
Were the things i wanted to realize, for example, regional smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's redundant.
At least, i see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing right now?
I mostly listen to music, watch music videos of my era on youtube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go on basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy society my wife иcабель, which has always been with me.
