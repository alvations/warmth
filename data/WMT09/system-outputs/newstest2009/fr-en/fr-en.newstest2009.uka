At the end of trade, the stock market in Prague bascula in the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange réctifia its losses. 
The transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half the usual daily trade. 
On Tuesday, from the early exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange renoua with its fall the previous day, when it lost nearly six percent. 
This time, the reduction is due to the fall of the Wall Street shares. 
The reaction of the market with the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the plan to stabilise the US financial sector, and is also felt here. 
Fall of shares in Asia 
The Asian exchanges lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, even though the indices succeeded, during the day, to remove some of the losses. 
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during the exchange, but later, he effaça some losses and reduced falling to nearly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China Enterprises following the movement of Chinese actions of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, markets are closed to Shanghai. 
The shares of the stock exchange of Sydney lost more than five percent, but in the end it manages to reduce losses to 4.3 percent. 
According to the index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent. 
"The hesitation about the action of the US rescue affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, the head of the office's monetary Hong Kong. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is independently of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates have the same level in Hong Kong that the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal for supporting the financial system. 
Otherwise, we risk that other countries are suffering the consequences. 
The bloodbath of US actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, which it would have had to spend up to $ 700 billion (nearly 12 bilions of Kč). 
The renièrent legislators and the appeal to the support of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole. 
The American actions lived, on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices action experienced the largest fall in the past 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index lost almost 7 %, having been a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost already during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
Congress gave: the US government can inject $ 700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form agreement financial support for the American financial system. 
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The US legislators effectuèrent a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to the tune of $ 700 billion (approximately 12 billion kronor), given the American financial system. 
The success does not mean they are safe. 
Indeed, prior to publish the final version of the law and put to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan to support the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday at the Reuters agency Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of the banking and financial regulation of the House. 
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should initially be put to the vote in the Senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
However, given the complexity of the mechanism by which aid to markets can be effective, will follow a "disappointment". 
Paulson: the plan must be effective 
" We have made great progress. 
We have solved our opinions on the form that should be the package of measures to stabilise the market, " assigned to the agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
In it, the final vote could be made as early as Sunday. 
In Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the rencontrèrent legislators the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to give the fund a government's final form. 
It should buy, with the financial companies, assets to sell property resulting financial companies in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
" We 're about to agree on a plan that will work and must be, well, effective on the market. 
We must still go ahead with this plan to restore the markets, but I think we are, " said Paulson. 
A signal for Asian exchanges 
The global financial crisis has a great impact on the markets of actions that fall. 
The Democratic senator is évadiez Harry Reid, legislators are so that Congress will lead to a final agreement as early as Sunday. 
They want to and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence trade on Monday. 
But, for now, it is impossible to say with certainty when both Houses of Congress comes out the vote, or if the negotiations do not remain blocked, at the last moment, for this or that problem. 
Legislators expect that he will be adopted during the days to come. 
However, the bill will still many changes. 
The total amount devoted to aid the system must be divided into two parts. 
The first $ 350 billion, as the wanted President George Bush, must be available as soon as possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the program does not fulfil his office, he has the option to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first additional $ 100 billion, and then, finally, $ 350 billion. 
Mr. Bush salua progress in negotiations 
Although the president can put its veto to this decision, Congress, himself, has the opportunity to put it in a minority. 
Despite these changes, the main thrust of the programme, which was to obtain finance to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value chuta, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
" All the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to make Sunday to vote on the bill, and the Senate on Monday, " identified the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
US President George Bush himself is glad of progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement of relief, the development of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also plans to limit the golden parachutes for managers of companies participating in the programme and it set up a committee, which will ensure the supervision of the funds. 
It should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress toward a settlement that work and will be effective in the market and to all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also includes aid for the property owners, who have problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new advance in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while cutting payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: psychological assistance 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult. 
" And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of buying assets to problems. 
This will be crucial to decide on the share losses between the financial sector and the government, " said Marek, this week, the server iHNed.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, according to Marek, not that serious. 
" It is much more important than the congressmans to agree, as early as this week, they support the plan and that they will devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological significance of the deal, with the approval of the plan, the most important thing at the moment, " stressed Marek. 
The fight taken to extremes: MP3 players against the mobile. 
You advise, how to choose 
While almost all mobile can read the MP3 files, any MP3 player knows telephone. 
He seems to be clear that it is better to buy just a phone. 
However that there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader. 
The choice depends entirely on the way we use and the requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy a gramophone for home expensive high-end to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such music products remain on record chloride, and, in terms of quality, there is no real reason, in order for that to happen. 
However, if your shelves discs vinyles crowded, with the rock art, the jazz or blues, some hope at least likely such a gramophone. 
This is music for travel, namely music high-pressure, to put a simplified music in MP3. 
Also, there are categories depending on the price and quality. 
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, in the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would find it difficult to bear headphones purchased for 20 kronor to the market. 
These are two extremes, from which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is broad. 
The life of the battery is also crucial 
Some readers of high-end music are capable of much more than a simple reading music, but it is unknown functions, of course, most mobile. 
No current apparatus is as universal as the telephone. 
Has the primary functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, he is able to read music and films, registering them, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, to be used for shipping. 
And if one takes into account the Smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that none would shelve knows burn meat and no television will take pictures, we have almost a miracle. 
However, the universal mobile is not without problems. 
The more functions you use is high, the time between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And the music is one of the most important goinfres energy. 
The mobile few who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, the figure is much lower. 
Here, readers music (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient. 
In the case of good mobile market, will they will play music for a few hours. 
If, in addition, they would just call from time to time, procurez-vous, to be sisters, a second recharge for the work - having even apply to the more expensive equipment. 
Themselves should be no problem for MP3 players, which are capable, following a reloading, a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less efficient. 
Another problem occurs when the registration of music in the mobile. 
Sadly, only a limited portion of the aircraft has a connecteur universal USB, as not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
There is, of course, record music directly onto the memory card, but few card readers know go without reduction, given the tiny size of memory cards used in mobile phones. 
As far as readers, you do need, without exception (iPod), no software. 
It is enough to fill, through the connecteur USB, the music from the computer. 
Most mobile and readers themselves will create a library media classified under the name of the performer, the title of the album, style, and then after the judgment of the user. 
Some have equipment that an index with a tree structure, in the manner of the Explorer of Windows, others are capable of the two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the smart phones with operating system). 
Readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more expertise 
In choosing a specific apparatus, intéressez-vous above all to the lifespan of the accumulateur, the ability of memory, quality and type out of her and, of course, to the ease of the contract. 
If music is for you, essentially, a noise and if the day you are going to listen to that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you only have any mobile reading the MP3. 
Almost all the mobile can now. 
You are not even obliged to do too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music that will come up to you this format. 
It is one of the formats and hand him, the vast majority of equipment is also read music of WMA format. 
The PCA (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less informed. 
The high-end mobile also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It suffices to visit, since the mobile phone, the websites of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a compelling reason to buy a mobile music. 
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, the radio tubes quickly facts. 
Prices are not very low. 
However, it is generally believed that the way to buy music (either phone, Internet, or by the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people still carry their mobile on itself. 
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to leave the mobile your pockets, while you forgot your MP3 player at home. 
However, it is also important if you are still on the headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the included pregnant, as have virtually all mobile, but a modicum of readers MP3. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than 3000. 
For a price of three four thousand kronor, you can have a very good walkman. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones. 
The price of the best phones and better equipped, also a entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed 15000. 
Readers, however, have the advantage of having a easy command. 
Really anyone is to ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers who do not necessarily correspond to cheaper (cf. our choice). 
A minimum of functions ; and the similarity of the order with a tape post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet branché by chance, followed by a bill of data transmission of immense. 
What apparatus choose 
Even the cheapest mobile (by ex. The Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for memory cards exchangeable (the M2 type, microSD, and so on). 
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor. 
But be careful. 
The basic models support in principle of cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the more expensive fare even with memory cards 8 GB. 
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a MP3 player cheap, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 kroner. 
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, rather than choose mobiles-walkman specialist (Sony Ericsson, certain Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices are filled test of independent command for MP3, and this is how the ease of the order is closer to that of a MP3 player independent. 
Sony Ericsson, the mobile walkman series have the same user menu that readers MP3 sold separately, is the one who went furthest in this area. 
The same service, in the same category, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and a life expectancy of the accumulateur (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) superior, is secured by an MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator will gain the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively late, our operators offering virtually the same services that their partners in western Europe. 
Despite this, there is still something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will for a long time. 
We have already mentioned, repeatedly, on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The ČTÚ (The Office Czech Telecommunications), which said that the price of a SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed. 
This is how, as a result of the final steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could happen - the SMS sent from abroad to some customers ' mobile operators Czech cheaper than the country. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, it is a competition that would really go into the fight. 
This may seem strange, since we have even three mobile networks and penetration that beyond the 100 %. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this, Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Office telecommunications (ČTÚ), which has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there were more room for another operator, fact join operators. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network has apparently much chance (for that matter, now, it would be difficult to frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has led to a significant fall in prices, which were supposed to, afterwards, also react traditional operators. 
However, even before the entry of hold such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the voice similar to those that is now home to effect in Britain. 
However, it is clear that there was room for such operators and they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples. 
In February we had informed the launch, in Poland, the Mobilking virtual operator. 
In six months, the operator has won more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country. 
Ajoutons that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has between the other U: fon in Tchèquie. 
The advantage of virtual operators are able to focus on a target group far more practical. 
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator. 
They are, indeed, without the cost of construction, operation and maintains the mobile network, relatively high. 
This is how in the world, the virtual operators are emerging as operators to low cost - they propose calls and text messages cheap, which is often balanced by an offer of limited services. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, the SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland, commit to a target group unusual can also be a good PR stunt. 
Indeed, the operator is specifically men. 
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator who they want and that they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is hard to say, if such a concept would be likely to also walk home. 
Miroslav Čepický, the Vodafone spokesman, in doubt: " the Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is most ' virtual operators based. 
Because it is relatively saturated from the standpoint of the supply of services. " 
In the Czech Republic, no chance, said mobile operators 
He nevertheless seems almost certain that there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking. 
" We are discussing the expansion of the project to succeed, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very promoters. 
The launch of Mobilking will rather place in other countries in our area, " said in a's telephone to Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta. 
She has indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, at least, not in favour of this idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to that a potential competitor can appear. 
The GTS Novera group, which wants and take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, not hide, long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
" We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only telecommunication services fixed, but also mobile. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have already led negotiations about this possibility repeatedly with all the Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we managed to make progress in the negotiations, " said the spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is perhaps promising. 
According to unofficial information, it seems that maybe we could accommodate the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for now, its creation was accompanied by a total silence. 
" At this moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is compared with other very specific. 
For the moment, no provided a complex and serious project in this area we have contacted, " Vlastimil Sršeň mentioned the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz. 
Other operators is also related to the nature of the Czech market. 
The T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "we have not registered for the time being viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis." 
And strong-competition: " it is almost impossible for a virtual operator in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
To operate in a limited period of time, we should have now a specific agreement. " 
Vodafone rather moving its attention on the performance of the requests to obtain its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav Čepický said in this report: " we are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared-cost and infrastructure. 
This is, in our view, means the most contributions from the standpoint of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner to create a common network for the mobile Internet fast. " 
The authorities: in line with operators 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to lower prices and so to a decline in their benefit. 
What good is facilitated the advent of such a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, operators know themselves as fair larrons. The harassment accompanying the creation of the U: fon witness too. 
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, at the creation of the U: fon, was that of the T-Mobile society. 
In the information available to the public of web pages of ČTÚ. 
Today, however, the U: fon ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová said on this subject: " competition in the mobile market was, moreover, recently increased by the entry of a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market RT, it is clear that the entry of an extra player would subject, and above all its services, high demands. " 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators that, the indifference of regulatory bodies Czech is disconcerting. 
It is not only the attitudes of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately has not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, it took, faced with this issue, its typical position. 
" The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market could following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator about renting the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement has been reached for now, because the supply of interested potential originally had not presented enough interest in traditional operators, " said in response to the question Kristián Chalupa Department of external relations ÚOHS. 
A statement and would surprise not from representatives of operators. 
But from an office, which should represent the interests of consumers and also take care, that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is confusing. 
More than Kristián Chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that entering the market has contributed to a decline in the price of mobile telephone services." 
But, push in the direction of an honest functioning market and a decline in prices is apparently not part of the ÚOHS interests. 
What is shocking, that is harmony almost touching the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question, if he is really a chance, is naturally. 
Similarly, the price of petrol strictly equal to all the service stations surement is by chance and the battle of the competition. 
" The office has not increased, on this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it has no reason to act in one way or another. 
None of the operators has dominant position, no therefore has a corresponding responsibility of his behaviour on the market. 
The tools for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even the regulator telecommunications, " said in his statement Chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant market position is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by the ČTÚ, that the telecommunications are, from the standpoint of economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in this market. 
However, some experts law propose another vision: to create a virtual operator is possible, he must get, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
This is the way it necessarily plays a leading role in a certain segment of its business. 
However, even without admit this argument, he should at least be worrying for the ÚOHS three mobile operators are clearly in a similar way. 
However, the many complaints concerned (including the GTS Novera society, already mentioned) show they meet, in negotiations with all operators, similar constraints. 
To place the blame on the ČTÚ is a fairly course in communications, through which the ÚOHS is washing his hands of the case. 
We have already seen this kind of attitude in many similar cases. 
We unfortunately has failed to pass in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted, an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement in the situation. 
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS well must know, but their interests are apparently other. 
When no one is watching, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a sort of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
It is companies issuing their own price list of mobile phone services, but these are public in part. 
In most cases, it is a question of companies are in the multi-level marketing. 
Mobile telephone services particularisés are proposed for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists of these firms are typically of elected. 
The round of magic is in the fact that the company is in front of the operator is a classic company customer, who commands a large quantity of SIM cards. 
As important clients, it gets the price (and others) special. 
The problem, is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale. 
"If it happened that you raise, it may be a violation of contractual conditions that we look and could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," has responded to the question on this Martina Kemrová problem. 
However, it is quite unlikely an echo of such activity has failed to responsible for mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it may be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, is to speak out against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these their firms are just profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: " the law allows such speculation, however, the services of these businesses are used by a percentage of customers negligible. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phones is not registered under their name, so they cannot have it fully, in the manner of ordinary customers ' mobile operators. " 
However, it is precisely that should seem strange to ČTÚ. 
Moreover, there is another issue at the ÚOHS. 
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why are blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
I must add that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to unveil any such activity, and if he might wish not only explanations operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions the ban. 
When we will not be the most expensive 
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators in the mobile market has made a significant reduction in the price of services. 
However, in almost all countries where appeared virtual operators, the traditional operators are efforçaient, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these were virtually the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
However, it is precisely where spoke, in developed countries, the regulators, who defended not the interests of the mobile operators, but those customers. 
Both by formal action by an informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the regulators Czech treat this issue to a potato hot that the passing to close a target. 
As a result of the experiences we have, we can do away with the impression that the disarray in the competence is in these cases more profitable. 
But we must not give up so easily. 
If the information behind the scenes saying true and a virtual operator will soon be home, the Czech mobile market resumes perhaps movement. 
If one of the operators agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can only hard to remain impassive face rejection (discrimination) other interested. 
And we may continue to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Well the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, during the Day of the Czech nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (where is my home?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the orchestra of National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with chœur and an instrumental version. 
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Bělohlávek regards the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems. 
As he had already given before the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen to interpret the solo versions of singers with young people and representative of the votes, which are marked and appreciated. 
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the chœur, have a good walking, so that it is well understood the words, they sing a simultaneous," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will be, the next year, his birthday 175è. 
The song Kde domov můj retentit for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the states Theater) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of savetiers), Czech original piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music František Škroup. 
It has become popular with people have spontaneously appropriate. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath naturally became an integral part of the national anthem. 
He demeura one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
Sounds how the "new" anthem 
The transport (MHD) Prague will introduce, on Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
The Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be enshrined in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise transport) as the date on which set in the subway, trams and buses the first passengers, which, instead of having a paper ticket in, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
At the moment, it is accessible for approximately 100000 people, owners of the smart card Opencard. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both to register on their smart card information points and the offices of Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying the voucher per Internet web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people profitèrent service during the morning. 
Those who will begin to use the online shop can forget definitively the counters in the subway stations, where they were so far trampling of impatience in long lines to get the paper tickets. 
Indeed, they buy their coupon per Internet and this will on their card Opencard in one of thirteen knihovna Městská (municipal library). 
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of a one-stop shop passengers with trained staff, which will help those involved with the purchase on the Internet, and more, will the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesman Martin Opatrný project. 
Alongside libraries, it will be possible to record the electronic voucher on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several subway stations. 
What are these distributors? 
They are red, recall the machines composter the tickets and passengers have perhaps already noted in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.

The Sudeten called for a referendum in the United States 
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava is included in the United States. 
This follows a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the southern Bohemia). 
If we cannot be part of Germany and Austria, we at least want to live under the management of the United States of America. 
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans are allegedly directed to the US president with such a desire. 
It is between a letter maintained in a private archive, which is now lodged in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
The Germans Český Krumlov pray in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (area of forest in southern Bohemia) - it was annexed by Hitler in the Munich agreement - to be made to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation and really want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are on the German territory not by oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says in the letter, signed "people, the fate of the Šumava is cœur." 
Since the rallying to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude without respect, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter are the American president take in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever. 
"We cannot believe, you would give this territory in a foreign country to us, that oppresses and destroyed the minorities and who has done nothing to the Allies victory without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million people," says in the letter. 
The so-called why the authors may not sign the letter is the fear of a desire for revenge ' "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president doubted the opinion of Šumava Germans, he would have to hold, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if the people wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the management of the United States. 
Although the text in the letter can, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war period, seem somewhat naïve, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans of the time. 
While the Czech Germans should at least suggests that the question of their expulsion of the Republic will, very few of them are avouaient such a possibility. 
Some expected the United States and Britain would get a certain type of autonomy for the Sudeten. 
Others believed that they would simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this. 
During the war, it was, as a German citizen of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries. 
Lorsqu at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and placed on the side of catching the region Holstein, dozens of Czech Germans were consulted to learn their Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, the Czech their would be beneficial," said Chalupa. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought, according to him, that, following the Décrets Beneš, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You don't consider - you paies! 
An emotional campaign will drivers 
The action road safety most costly in Czech history. 
One way to characterise the emotional media campaign and launch, on Wednesday, the Department of Transportation. 
The minister Aleš Řebíček estimates that it will discourage drivers a dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets. 
It should discourage drivers driving rapid and drink-driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before kick off. 
She particularly wants to reach the consciousness of the young drivers, the motorcycle, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers. 
What will appear in the commercials? 
Especially the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Witness the slogan "bloody" of the campaign: 
You don't consider - you paies! 
The phrase "you don't consider" is ICANN-approved named on the registration plate. 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "you paieras." 
What needs to be a symbol that you can pay a life time of insufficient attention. 
The spots are "haunt" viewers until 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, which generally see images with drastic images of the victims of accidents. 
It estimates that it will lead to a reduction in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czech. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of the sugar and boost against drivers 
" What works with drivers, this is the system of sugar and boost. 
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, to save time, when they grillent a red light. 
The boost, it is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks need to be recalled to drivers, " said Martin Kořán, the psychologist transport the Na Homolce hospital. 
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and in particular the negative advertisements, believes the psychologist. 
The signs pointing out the danger drivers are, according to him, already less efficient. 
"When a static panel which warns against a danger is installed, he will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will see most," signala Kořán. 
Olmert would in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, President of the interim government of Israel, has said for the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview published Monday in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to almost all the territories (occupied), if not all," said Olmert on a daily basis. 
"We will keep a percentage of the territory, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israel), because without it, the peace will not happen," he added. 
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem, and especially not want tractors and bulldozers him crashing the feet, as happened at one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert referring to two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred places and historical" located inside the well city. 
" Anyone who wants to keep the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It will not work, " souligna-t-il thereafter. 
Retired from the Golan Heights 
Olmert also said for the retirement of Israel from the Golan Heights, which is, according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace deal with Syria. 
However, it also would require some efforts by Damascus. 
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retired the Golan Heights," signala-t-il. 
" The Syrians know well what they are going to have to give up for the Golan. 
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran ; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement) ; they will have to give up supports constant they give to the Hamas terrorism (Shiite movement), the Al-Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, " précisa Prime Minister. 
Issues that arise after the accident: the cabin in the illegal are for? 
The law ignores the ; walk in a long distance is banned 
In the context of the tragic accident the coach of society Student Agency almost Padua, Italy, the question if the cabin passengers can during the journey to move within the coach. 
"If you wanted to respect the law strictly and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which has died a hôtesse aged 22, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which cross the road to the coach. 
The girl was at this moment sadly sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
However, the coach may have an accident, or even slow down a steep, also at a time when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What matters, that is if the coach is under its technical statement equipped seats standing or not. 
If this equipment for standing places is not approved, passengers must remain seated. 
Coaches long-distance Student Agency does not have standing places ; what has been confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the director of the firm Radim Jančura. 
" This is an issue that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the start, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, " he revealed his position. 
The law ignores the steward 
" There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is responsible for this role. 
On the other hand, no legal prescription don't prevent the carrier to offer services. 
The law on road transport is only the term recipient of vehicle ; it does not define his rights and duties, " adds more ambiguity spokesman Hanzelka. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the movement of road vehicles, estimates, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the issue. 
" Everything depends on whether a coach in his approval permission to propose standing seats. 
Everything is bad, " he says. 
Coaches are divided into urban, where there are seats and a limited maximum speed, inter-urban with standing squares and speed allowed higher and coaches long distance without standing with the maximum speed and highest seats equipped with seat belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, expert to BESIP (safety of the traffic) safely in transport, is not the movement of cabin on board as a major problem. 
" At a regular movement, there is no risk. The situation can be compared to the service in aircraft. 
Once more, he is not sure when happen a turbulence and the hôtesse air can beat your head. " 
" However, if the bus would have held a sudden, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
In the same way as in an urban bus or a tram. 
The carrier must manage the safety of cabin by internal regulations, " he says and also believe that from the standpoint of the law, the issue is not settled. 
Jančura is ready to remove these services 
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer the services of cabin. 
The recruitment two hundred. 
Even after the accident, the director is not their job as a profession at risk. 
" However, once I have the impression that it is a profession at risk, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can get their coffee and newspaper to boarding. 
This would reduce the cost, " he says. 
The concern is the reason that gives the absence of cabin in its vehicles the Director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which assures, compared with company, a very small number of lines. 
" We have no hostesses. We are opposed from the start. 
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident, " he said, there is a years, to Týden.cz. 
A great tragedy came 
A young hôtesse region Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line in Naples. 
A Slovenian truck has probably quité the arrest of emergency without using clignotant and it blocked the path to the coach. 
The driver of the last to try to prevent a sharp manœuvre, but he has been near his right hand. 
Jančura refuses the two seats reserved for the rest of the cabin have been sold. 
"In the case of the long lines a distance, it is not possible to treat these places, they are stuck". 
The firm account sue the driver of the lorry. 
For the compensation to the family of the girl, the agency will not be the judgment of the court, but as far as the financial compensation, it also count on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A change in the law, which is being developed, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transport, could make the movement of cabin on board the bus. 
" However, it has not reached any conclusion on this point. 
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phone at the wheel, " said the expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of cabin as something that would fundamentally at risk the safety of passengers," concludes the Hanzelka spokesman, by saying that the safety monitoring coaches in the power of the police and the office to safety at work. 
The hopes of Düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The big words were not in a letter to the Board of Directors of the WestLB employees of the house. 
In a union of parts of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the Central institution of financial markets in the financial group the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a "bloc of competence" doubled a sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive sent to other concentrations in the banking sector Länder. 
Voila what it is like when a board committee is keen to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, injured, is still a lot of pressure. 
This is not just the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority of Surveillance Services Financiers which, it only recently, made it clear to the government of the province of the Nord-Westfalie Rhenanie that time was running out in the search for a solution of the future. 
It is a question for some time now - also from Frankfurt - a relationship of any kind between the bank Deka, which is the customers of the Sparkasse in their investment funds, and the WestLB. 
Of course the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced at the presentation of the figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the house of the Landstrasse Mainzer with a Land, whether the Helaba or WestLB. 
But the Board of Directors of the Deka, which each half falls and the state banks and funds groups of savings, instructed the steering committee of lead talks with the WestLB to common commercial activities. 
It could be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks come however only a start, it is said in the City. 
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, for one of the biggest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to consolidation in the sector funds of savings. 
In 2003 we thought for a moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank Rhine-Westphalian Palatinate and the Halbab. 
Nothing is evident from this ternaire mix. 
Barely plans had they been made public and the government's Land Hessen said it was against any involvement of the Hellaba in them. 
Afterwards, the other two houses either does not rejoignèrent. 
The Land Bank Rhine-Westphalian Palatinate was attached to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were always new talks on reunification of the Deka-Bank with banks Länder. 
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the steering committee of the Hellaba, was nonetheless voted against any commercial strategy merger with its bank. 
Apart from that, the feeling appears to spread the reunification of the various institutions of the public sector is especially urgent. 
Now that the election to the State House in Bavaria last, a union of BayernLB with the Land Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg could be put into practice first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure which requires new mergers should increase, the prospective partners outside him gradually. 
In the South, she is now a junior partner, though it has so far better resisted the crisis that banks from Munich and Stuttgart. 
The savings and Hesse-Thuringe transfers, with 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has drawn a barrier at the start of the year on any union with the WestLB. 
Would the rigour NordLB. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques does however that one of the facets. 
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models to each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl said that the decisive question, namely through what business model the future ability of Länder banks should be guaranteed, had not previously resolved by the German group funds of savings and transfers. 
Has run, a carve-up of the WestLb could take place, carving up which here is obviously not liked. 
It is also what is discussed in the letter of the board committee in place: in any case, would be covered a " global solution is for the establishment. 
How this will all be being lumped together with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the festival beer is also known as the weekend of Italian. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanies the as the girlfriend, and thus nothing is the same, he says. 
Behind them, almost over five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, is a bearded built which shows to about 200 visitors to the festival beer which sounds profound its gosier can produce.

And noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italian.

Already the bus driving in the night onto the Autostrada direction " Brennero is.

And let us not forget the instruction! 
" Show the security agents that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave your seats, they are parties! ' 
Troisièmement: " this evening, having come here ten and a half hours pile! Is Compris? 
And it is, it is party to the celebration of beer. 
On the road, someone would enter into yellow hats to trees back on track, the panels and even an election poster of a big Bavarian People's Party. 
We take to be ready for the return. 
This is the second weekend of the festival beer, known as the " weekend of Italian is. 
There are no precise figures ; we talk about 50 000 who road through the Alps and collapse in the stand beer, 10 percent of visitors would be ripe express in Italy this weekend. 
The police munichoise is reinforced by seven police officers of the South Tyrol Transit Forum, by Italian voluntary search-and-rescue teams for which support the Bavarian Red Cross who performs a statistic in the country where the Italian occupies first place in the UK (60 speeches) and the Austrian (80) with nearly 200 medical interventions. 
That is particularly appreciated by Italian, is trying to Hofbräu the brewery. 
Nights of sleep for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks. 
What chance that the politician used the word " relatively is and that he glissait that the German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of crisis. 
It is indeed events this weekend. 
The financial house Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX, gets a consortium of German banks credit of one billion to protect itself from turbulence in markets. 
One person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid money is awarded up to a total of 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the part in what she would and law. 
The money comes as private banks that banks public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille Depfa who bear the losses. 
The financial state was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible for the fact of distrust of the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the reserve of cash from the bank had been reduced by 95 % in 2.37 million, the rate of capital was also slightly declined to 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The ongoing profits and those net from financial transactions were, compared with the same period the previous year, at ground zero, the benefits from the allocation of claims and securities determined and the termination of provisions in the credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million. 
And it is only through the important benefits the reimbursement of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as the interest payments in the Book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for companies Konzern the deficit gains of around 16 percent has been moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state had first evil speculated on the mortgage industry, which had then been filialisés the Aareal Bank. 
Because the financing of classic state was not quite profitable, the Depfa then committed more intensively in infrastructure projects and the funding of joint projects between private investors and state (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diverse internationally. 
On the value of the société-fille, the Hypo Real Estate must make repayments which should have on calculating gains and losses of a group essential equipment which is still unclear. 
The fact is that the dividends have been cut. 
For 2007, they had been truncated two-thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of the Depfa, an investor of highly important state and infrastructure. 
It is more solid than other institutes dependent on the refinancing on the market inter-bancaire since it has no deposit of customers. 
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has again considerably expressed constant, banks have accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for some - about 50 euros Milliards - of all the resources of the Depfa a medium short-term refinancing. 
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding the group is covered with credit in the medium term and the firm protected the impact of international financial markets broadly outside running now. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be provided through the fund until the end of 2009. 
The president of the board committee HRE Georg Funke explained that the group Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and federal establishment for the Surveillance Services Financiers (Bafin) assume that the ability of the Hypo Real group on the market is now guaranteed. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank no longer have to hope. 
However, given the dynamic and impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not inconceivable that it will not use the funding in full. 
But the opposite either cannot be ruled out. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest reports, the doors of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue at least temporary will not reassure people either. 
The price has fallen by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
The bonds, by contrast, are particularly well. 
While the debts primarily have barely moved, the way loans second flagging plan. 
Most affected are especially investment funds from the former société-fille Württemberg Hypo and of course that have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed before being an investment alternative speculation, now their value should be viewed as dependent on the stability of the international system banker after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute who has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa. 
As long as the institutes emission, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, you can assume a reduction of arrears on time. 
Or will that nobody hope - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But in the face of renouvellés noises of a partial nationalisation, the likelihood that approached the sureté has now become a straightforward based hope. 
This should give the nights of sleep before the long-term creditors on the decision of whether to secede from their commitments. 
The short-term investors may still use what they have drawn a line for a postponement of the losses in the coming years on the forthcoming income tax capital gains automatically taken stock. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the ' into to Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years ago, must be present for the first day the Highschool of Tachibana, girls are beginning to pouffer laugh: the German is so "kawaii"! 
What it means? 
Sylvana is already the word through the Mangas - in its new Log exchanges, she speaks of Japan. 
" The first day in Japan. 
What I was excitée. 
The way to go to school I was afraid. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I find its own path, fortunately I am not lost. 
The start of doesn't seem to be so strict that home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils are one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours less 20, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room." 
But before the start, it was for me to stand. 
I am not the type to love speaking to people, particularly in front of a class of 40 pupils. 
As I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put an old jupe my mother host, and a shirt, blue rising socks and black leather footwear. 
In this place so, I am at the desk, and tried to make everything correctly: Sayonara Wo she Sylvana... - I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At the time, I was very happy to have begun to learn the language there two years ago. 
The 31 girls class have all been whispering, pouffé laugh and signs, and I constantly hear the word "Kawaii." 
I already knew thanks to my mangas. 
It is the essential vocabulary to the survival of Japanese and ados means "beautiful, nothing". 
Then I quickly there in my place. 
The girl next to me I have a great ironic smile, she found that it was an honour that the corresponding to sit next to her. 
The rest of the time was fairly calm, but when the drumming has sung, I was in the rules. 
Everyone was at the time, pouffait laugh and raised many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the English Japanese. 
During the break, they all got their Bento. 
My mother host me had also made such Lunchbox - it really is something other than the miserly German snack. 
I had rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan. 
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste. 
What is certain, is that everything is really good. 
Well, except maybe the confites salt plums, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools. 
Sometimes a daughter offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could see the also here. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I've told them I wanted to spend a year in school in Tokyo. 
I have always said: 
"Because it fascinates me, what" 
In the end, read mangas, that is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture which is, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese. 
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I also have a low for the traditions, the habits and customs. 
And here, it gives them a lot of importance. 
On the one hand, Japan is the country of technologies and the more recent trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And like everything is so well organised, I never felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen. " 
The rats have also sensations 
A rat or a cafard fled before the danger, est-ce-que it means that it also feels fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals have also sensations. 
But how could verify that it has the same thing when it is in the same way that we? 
In the magazine online "Edge," contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of articles answers to the question "what do you think be true without being able to have proof?" 
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has until now could prove just as you cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same situation. 
As soon as we look to other species and that we are dealing with issues of felt or general awareness, we move in difficult terrain because the Hardware is not. 
When a rat before a danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
Humans behave in the same way, that is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience. 
However, I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the implementation of our subjective experience to that of the difficult animals. 
One aspect is that the circuits involved almost always human consciousness include the prefrontal latéral Cortex (because of its participation in the memory in the short run and in senior management and executive). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans and other primates and seems to be entirely absent among other people. 
At least for these aspects-ci our conscience who depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and deciding, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from the other primates. 
Another significant feature may be the linguistic nature of man: a large portion of its existence is related to language, it often means that his conscience depends on it. 
In that case, you might exclude animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on language, that influence the surely, so that the animal awareness, regardless of how it is produced, would differ probably a lot of most of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is also difficult to determine what may be the consciousness among other animals. 
If that, internal and subjective, do not measure or, because of this particular Hardware, analyze based on our experience, then his observation we have major problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the content of the aware lived, but there are another aspect of the consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically. 
You could look at the process of conscience animal regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focus more on the nerve correlations of awareness on the causals mechanisms: the two can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underscores the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in achieving the display. 
But then résulte-t-il for emotions? 
I concluded that an emotional system such as a fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity. 
What we were like "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reaction of the body) owns the bright memory. 
And observed, emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex that characterize the primates and especially man. 
Of subtle degrees of felt, associated with our volubile nature, can be seen, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiation and categorise states for the blame others even. 
In contrast, Antonio Damasio for example think the sensations from primitive activities are born in the physical sense of strokes Cortex and the syllabus, much like Jaak Pankseep which concentrates more but require the waistline. 
As this network is not much changed in human evolution, he is part of transversal sensations of all kinds. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict him, but I believe that prove. 
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear among the Hommes and rats is probably also felt like that in both cases: how could yet whether the rats and the Hommes feel the same thing when they behave in similar way? 
A cafard fled before the danger, but if he felt fear? 
In my view, of similar behaviors are not enough to prove the same experienced. 
Yes, the comparison is helping nervous: rats and Hommes have similar brain troncs, the cafards however do not have a brain. 
But est-ce-que the brain syllabus is at the root of the sensations? 
And even if they could prove it for humanity: how could the show in rats? 
I believe that the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I don't know how the show. 
And because their sensations to differentiate probably completely from our own (since the human conscience is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior that the emotional sensations rats. 
In all cases, the advances are on the nervous as we weigh the same thing in rats and man. 
As I is not exploring the language and awareness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist. 
You might try it as in the short run, but I prefer to move on rather than bumping into things constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed a pragmatic émotionel. 
Michel Platini, the president of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The Prime Minister Deputy Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister. 
"The government regards UEFA's decision to Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championship," Wasjunik announced.

" We can no longer time to lose. 
We need to work at the maximum speed, " said President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA has constantly to the œil." 
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland. 
The direction of the PZPN Polish football league has been suspended by the Olympic Committee National after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The committee met on the request of the Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.

He dregs and counterattack. 
A war of late Rose to the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a battle disgracieuse - in full view of the world. 
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the US newspaper InStyle about the causes of the collapse of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful, and it was very painful." 
It would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce. 
The reason for this striptease de thinking lies in the press relations Ryan for his new film "the Women" - is told the story of a adultery. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction on his qualifications of unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be "monstrueux", said that "new York Daily News," 54 years old, that "Meg remâche again the history of our relationship and manipulated".

The price of tickets and hotels fall 
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a current study, the flights would be even reduced up 50 percent. 
Flights and hotel nights would again become advantageous - this is the result of a review of financial services provider and travel American Express. 
The company has analysed its data bookings of the first half of 2008 and has established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp fall in profits in the second quarter. 
After the market prices hotels have been rising for years, the hotel nights have already reduced in many places. 
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of 48 European cities examined still 6.9 percent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of 48 European cities examined. 
April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year. 
The trend was particularly marked in Paris and in Rome, where the passengers were paid by 30 to 37 per cent less than a year ago. 
The causes of all of this résideraient for American Express in the low value of the dollar which has led to a "desire to travel downturn in American tourists". 
The financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would be even more affected by the decline in the price of hotels that industrial sites like Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, prices for hotels are held with a 26.3 percent increase, the highest in Europe. 
Also in the price of flights, the trend was on the increase in the first quarter: 
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class have pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the long-haul flights, very consumers fuel, have risen to 29.2 %. 
April to June, the price of economic class notes fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared with the previous quarter, in business class and first class however, the price variations were significantly less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have been falling even more important than in other European countries: 
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they were down 23.6 percent. 
The German domestic flights have been divided according to the study by two. 
The reasons for the fall in prices would be an economic growth slowing, explains the firm. 
The request cèderait ground in many market segment travel by plane. 
On the other hand, there is pressure greater competition in the "open skies" which liberalise air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of the tense situation is the removal of the airlines ' non-rentables journeys, as well as the high number of airlines have submitted the results for the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0 
With a simple purpose and methods, the Hamburg approach becomes first rankings. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven. 
De Kristoffer Klein. Agrandir. Atterrissage disaster in international player Marko Marin. 
The player Gladbach rentra does that late in the game and its sights lifted post against the part of the goal. 
His message was made, it was out of his lips so persuasive. 
It was simply that he was right. 
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of off the arena of Hamburg. 
There was little in the changing room, half-time was over and most were stale in their place. 
Rieger was for nearly three decades of HSV things, he has a great reputation as former players. 
And that is why the request was received the strategic places. 
The entraineur assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and lifted the boost to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the entraineur in Hamburg head of Martin Jol. 
Whose orders appear to have been similar: and it is obvious this second goal! 
The practice has failed. 
"Everything was not very nice to do today," did later Marcel Jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would "also liked to be more relaxed." 
The 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg should a strike of the successful head by Mladen Petric (in the eleventh minute) ; and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could do no harm to weak players of Hamburg. 
"It was a dirty victory," Marin was Jol. 
The approach of Hamburg will celebrate on Monday its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans are commemorated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the league tables on the giant screen that showed their club as first class. 
Ca will be one without real anniversary celebration. 
"We know take a step back," said Marcell Jansen. 
There is doubt that the result means the table reflects the unpredictable nature of the first League that domination of its HSV. 
The team with its late arrivals committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the purpose of guardian Petric as débauché Jansen of FC Bayern - certainly form slowly, but it is not yet. 
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol required.

The dark matter influence the flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the confusion: the influence slipping on the speed of space probes during the so-called manœuvres support gravitationnel. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely right. 
For almost 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in the area. 
The fact of conductions soon fuel frozen, the cryogène death threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is because of confusion among researchers - the anomaly of the gravitationnel support. 
The gravitationnel support is a manœuvre of space probes, for which they are granted a further momentum in the gravitationnel scope for a heavenly body, the earth for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe research américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens used this physical device, much like the Ulysses solar probe. 
This surprised researchers also for years: the would create objects are not always 100 % of the way one would expect in the venerable laws of gravity. 
Far more, irregularities appear in speed. 
The probes are becoming faster or slower unexpected way. 
So far, physicists could not explain this. 
They baptisèrent the anomaly of the gravitationnel support. 
Some experts fear that the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein, who described the force of attraction of because of the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct. 
The US physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as that Einstein chose and trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitationnel support to the so-called black field that astronomers will have identified in the universe. 
"The black could be responsible for this anomaly, on which is also near the Earth," he writes. 
Researchers in the area know about the black only for about ten years ago. 
He apparently from a force of attraction which can be observed in other célestes body. 
She, by contrast, is completely invisible, that sends nor does any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the black field would be a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.

Michael Trerise, 57ans, from Stithians, in Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after he admitted eight charges for ways of facts are a disgrace. 
The high court to Truro has referred it regularly linked its belle-fille, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, 5 to 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter to confession: "I feel responsible for his death." 
The court was told that Miss Randle, aged 34, is suicidée home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007. 
Child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had committed and bandée before the force to sexual acts, while his mother worked at the pub.

And even more surprising, is that if she had made this gesture, its history would certainly never over the court. " 
It was: " I would, as describe his father and his mother, the effects of your crime had made for years about Stéphanie.

Companies building with the B bill 
The British companies building may have to pay a bill of more than £ 80 million, to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley. 
The Government has provided £ 14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys. 
The interest of the loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building societies. 
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said that he is "irritating" that companies and their members will have to pay the bill … 
The loan of £ 14 billion will be repaid when the mortgages of Bradford & Bingleys are released. 
But the interests that at the same time will increase, will be charged, each year, the 700 financial companies that collect deposits. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC, the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have had a … prudent behaviour must now pay some bills institutions that were far less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It claims that every society must pay a proportional amount to deposit it has, and that the middlemen companies must pay about 18 % of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interests of the loan will in 2009, to £ 450millions. 
This means that companies will have to find £ 81 million to settle the interests of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the trade committee of the building societies, told the BBC that this decision it seemed unfair. 
It is "annoying" to see that the institutions that have had a prudent behaviour during the recovery of the housing market, now must pay for the institutions are much less cautious. 
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, when the first record. 
"We need to examine all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess the options to prevent the building societies and their members pay the hefty bill" Mr. Cole said. 
The 2009 interests to cover seven months, from late September of this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, the interests of the whole year, which could also double. 
Since the building societies are organizations without shareholder, their member will foot the bill by the higher costs, or lower interest rates for savings accounts.

Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the League Awani, has demanded that the interim military government of the country gives him his first complete freedom. 
Correspondents have pointed out that the terms of his release are contradictory if he allows to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it would remain free to his return in Bangladesh. 
His lawyers have announced that it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the depositions.

BSkyB is losing the legal battle to ITV 
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would have to reduce its participation in its ITV rival provider. 
The Court of appeal of Competition has ordered BSkyB to cut its ITV shares of 17.9 % to less than 7.5 %. 
The commission said that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV unfairly. 
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, buy ITV. 
In April 2007, the Bureau of fair trading has been reported that the purchase by BSkyB, shares of ITV sowed doubt on the effective independence of ITV, encouraging consequently, the Competition Commission to investigate 
The Virgin boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the regulator Ofcom were all contrary to this purchase. 
BSkyB said that the force to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and instead was excessive – especially since BSkyB has to give up its voting rights. 
New investigation in the case of American prosecutors. 
The American general lawyer appointed a special accuser to check the question of the dismissal of nine US prosecutors in 2006. 
It is the account of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which criticised the actions of some ministerial officers.

"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said the Inspecteur General, Glenn Fine, in his report. 
The appointment of a special accusing able to force the witnesses to deposit, was one of his greatest recommendations.

It would repaver Extra Place, and create a smooth transition to the stores and shops, which should open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers including of longtime neighbors, said to be happy with this shortcuts simply because he is one of the last and oldest streets of pâté houses. 
But the Department of Préservation and Development Immobilier of the city who manages the street, has no interest in the bear. 
This month, at a meeting of owners committees neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal authorizing the house manufacturer to buy the street. 
But the committee would prefer that the street is in the hands of the city, and has called for a new proposal to make the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No 3. 
"There is little spaces in the city, and we would like to see the city retains Extra Place" she said. 
"They could offer to refurbish it and the handle, which also Avalon could do, but we want to maintain the public". 
Avalon Bay announced months ago that she wanted to repaver the small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee which the manufacturer concédera space. 
The proposal to the potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, this does not necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner. 
" The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this been abandoned, and the public " she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Préservation the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted well sell the streets, saying in addition, the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than the handle. 
Compared to its neighbor more colourful, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historic footprint. 
Some believe that Extra Place is the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great firm of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving away this small, who since abandoned. 
The subsequent entry of CBGB, a monument 17-year-old punk rock closed in 2006, has re open to Extra Place ; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photograph in coverage of the album to Ramones "to Stephenson Russia" 
"This place was magnificent" skipper Danny Fields said, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of ferrailles, of haillons, barrique, around, sheets and ropes. " 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already spoken of evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this small humble property should be public. 
Other Extra Place proclaimed as a true rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be rotten in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called Jeremiah' is Vanishing New York (sous-titré "the Book of Contestations: a Amèrement Regard A Nostalgique on City in the entered to Extinction") recounting the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and based on the doors of a warehouse in inexistent iron and persiennes, full of newspapers last week that are soaring along the gouttières." 
Few exceptions, the street was always the same rate. 
A rat agilement short at the bottom of the alleyway, almost a door that were once at CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store skinned. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer from 22 onces vacuum, rests alongside newspapers that have just been thrown. 
A few passers-by said they did not think that rarely to Extra Place, and suggested his development. 
Mr. Field, for its part, said that he thought some under believed the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life" he said, "were in the dark, wet places and repugnant". 
The Debate Bilingue: dumping in the English language 
In this part of the Supervision programme of education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidate on bilingual education. 
Spear T. Izumi, a former member of the studies in California, and a former director of the department of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Bon that You do Pensiez. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school." 
Draw the favours of Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of Obama on education are an interesting example. 
Mr. Obama's campaign points out that "African-Americans and Latin students have less chance of diplômer than white students." it is a true fact. 
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr. Obama supports especially among many other subjects, "education transitional bilingual" for those who learn English. 
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to carry out a bilingual education which promotes education class in languages other than English, is also its interest to eliminate the differences. 
Take for instance, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of conté of Los Angeles. 
Students in the school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, and low income. 
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, studied English. 
Among the students of the CM1, 100 % spent examining state of maths 2008, expert level. 
Similarly, almost 93 % of students spent examining langues-d' anglais-de arts 
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that made by Mr. Obama. 
Sixth Street on analyses, practice, a constant evaluation capacities and exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, brings Linda Mikels, the main Sixth Street, the school has established the instruction of the English language "dumping full". 
The dumping total in English focusing on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Miss Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, has stated "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you were going without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying the." 
" This march, observe-t-elle, " it worked for us " 
Mr. Obama should not take example of Sixth Street Prep and respond in other schools made up the majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves ; but policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education has long supported the bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscured the pronostique response to Mr. Obama. 
Although it is in favour immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama has recently seen this question as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop polemicise on the wording of the law in English. 
" On the contrary, he said, " you have to ensure that your child speak Spanish. " 
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he would then consider carefully, the education models who work, rather than dismiss or view them as insignificant.

The celebration of the Second Temps Déterminante for Improving the Record of the Equipe. 
Having spent in the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in the Jets uniform Shaun Ellis, the defender thought had seen everything. 
He watched the second time, when the Jets transformèrent a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything of this kind" Ellis said. 
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under dark clouds. 
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles for a touchdown from 12 yards, sign of an afternoon in which their relationship has taken a step forward. 
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, in 10 seconds of the half. 
"I am not out of my area" Favre said about all its having to Coles. 
"This is a mediocre player" 
"We can communicate extremely well, despite what people think." 
While Favre and Coles were the catch, the defensive end of the quarter of the Cardinals back, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle Revis, corner back, has intercepted a lost and made 32 yards to the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another and has stopped. 
Linebacker, David Bowens left escape the ball because of Warner. 
The last change, the loss of ball Bowens, may be the most charming 
The Cardinals have taken control of the possession in the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets have recovered the ball, Jay Feely made an example of 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was better than the Jets could mark at a time. 
" The ' Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who were asked to describe this madness, said " the second time or third? " 
When he said the two - the Jets have missed 21 points in the third time Mangini said: " I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third. 
. "many points have been marked in a short space of time." 
Gebrselassie based, exceeds his world record. 
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title of best long-distance athlete of the century, after having beaten his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie was up 27 seconds of 2: 04: 26, disputed last year in Berlin. 
35 years ago, Gebrselassie won the 26th in the world record of its superb career during which he has won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, the 1600mètres marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - can be so exaggerated in the eyes of today, that air pollution increased its problems asthma. 
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In nearly perfect conditions sunny time, 48 degrees at the start, 55 on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The trail runners as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into runners of substance, have contributed to the drop in the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory Sunday, Gebrselassie said to reporters, have suffered the crampes mollet two weeks before, and have missed training for a week. 
It is obvious that the rest had been successful, but not inexistent. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
" Everything was perfect. 
I have called the last week, and today, I had doubts ; but in the end, it all went for the better. "" 
It has accused - especially in Kenya, the rival is African Ethiopia - of having too orchestrate its shopping, avoiding the global stars marathon, relying on the hares as if they were in a competition trail, and more world records than the competition. 
But the criticism is not the greatness of Gebrselassie capabilities as a runner of substance. 
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. to middle way. 
Two runners elite Kenyan, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the leading heads have disappeared. 
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final push to move away from Kwambai, which is second in 2: 05: 36, improving the best record staff of five minutes. 
Kamathis is is third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, has completed a remarkable year seeking seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
Britain's Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
The last spring, old Mikitenko of 36 years, has surprised everyone winning the London an in 2: 24: 14. 
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical badly on the back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving its third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It courut making a clever strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyan take a good advantage, the then exceeding about 18miles ½ after. 
Askale Tafa Margasa Ethiopian came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, 18-hour third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a City to Part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Vie 
Caché in the development of its huge park, just a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and Orlando giant, is a small quiet city where are born the pride and the complications of afro-américaine experience. 
"Eatonville, first fully black city to integrate, home of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description than it did in 1935, is no longer so simple to do nowadays." the city in the five lakes, three short of croquet "300 foncées skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not prison". 
It now has become a pilgrimage city 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in different ways, the city he describes - has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide to the Florida published by The Depression - era Federal writers ' Project - remains a place to share. 
It is also independent, dignified, and private than it was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, which "we with so little, does not know what he is." 
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on race, many here remain cautious of gaze from abroad. 
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" Hortense Jones said, 59, resident always and the oldest paroissienne of the city. 
" It must be in line with reality. 
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It is a historical model of a takeover of black and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - a few times ignored, other times hailed - reminiscent of the birth of American slavery. 
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective. 
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston. 
It presented its hometown worldwide through sincere books, full of dialect, such as " mules and Men " (1935) and " " their Eyes Were Watching God " (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide to the Florida transformèrent this city, located just out of Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida, often forgotten, who leads in chapter of history and of the human drama. 
Audacieuse such a big fund in life as in literature, Hurston led readers of property from the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
" Last road on the left, " écrit-elle, " you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its parks and play areas well maintained that Howard Miller has always been careful, though he knows barely literate. 
It was also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of all kinds and everything that can be used to people crossing. 
Then, in just a few hundred words, Hurston combined Eatonville to a government car but also to the analphabétisation, the remariage, and sex. 
Of course, Fodor was not the case. 
It was not in fact a portrait that everybody appreciates. 
Zora described the reality "it Dinkins said, 90 years ago, one of the girls to Johnson that Hurston was immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who louaient their beauty". 
She was: "some people did not like." 
We remember always Hurston as a live person and excentrique, which was frequently after his family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, rappela that Hurston was usual in town without warn, on a big Chevy car, a cigarette in the mouth and was here trousers, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed it. 
"People were still happy to see Zora" he said. 
But it also adds, is balançant in his chair of the patio since giving on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly called, that "she was never too long". 
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out production. 
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College of 1920, it was buried in any falls, in Fort Pearce from, Fla, where she lived. 
Has Eatonville, no great celebration, or plate for the general public. 
I do not believe that they have understood the contribution or the legacy it offered in the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of " Wrapped in Rainbows, " a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Public officials of Orange County wanted to build a motorway to five routes in the city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, main street two-track community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 until the angle west of the city. 
The proposal was made while Eatonville healed just a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led hatred at the gates of the community. 
"Then, a gang of white youths were launching oranges or objects against people sitting on the side" Mr. Franklin said. 
"A lady even died." 
They followed a pastèque their car ". 
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the depositions to a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse my race". 
Residents now proclaim that eliminating racial segregation in schools, though positive in some aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakens the trust of the young. 
"The black children used to be embrassés - I remember - we embrace our master in the morning, and the evening" N.Y. Nathiri said, daughter of it Dinkins and head the Sauvegarde Community of Eatonville, a non profit group. 
It has taken, ajouta-t-elle, until teachers and students do more came from the same place. 
"You don't embrasses tone White professor because he is white - I want to say that there is here, a dividing line of cultural" Miss Nathiri said. 
Civil rights, for that matter, have helped to create the space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who went in addition to the damage, as, armed with a cheerful confidence and guidelines such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!" 
This is beyond me. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the anonymous grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, the réintroduisit to American guns. 
The project of the motorway came just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville had regained its appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston regard it as a sauveuse. 
The community has started to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway. 
Hundreds of fans have come to the opening of the festival after two years, and many in January, to commemorate the. 
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway. 
"The fiasco of the motorway to five channels, extremely rapid, a genuine civic pride" Miss said. Nathiri. 
Miss Boyd summed up the entire declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the project of the motorway has enabled him to change his own image. 
People non-resident, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who frequent our church depuis1993, began coming in large numbers, and residents began to revisit the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic town since 1998. 
A mono library theme (of course renowned Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville is an anomaly for Florida: six miles to Orlando, it can at any time is seen as a back street subsequent during a day of summer rain, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's. 
(now are 90 % of black) 
Foreigners who come to see the history of Eatonville, its raison d 'être, still are treated with caution. 
We have to ask permission for most of the interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, of black men in the fields must not be photographed. 
Much to Eatonville, as Miss Jones, a courageous and teacher who has a low for the great red, are still afraid that their island community is understood. 
However, given the expansion of Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, mad and composite that other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is the genuine civic affection that is in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or forces Police, who need additional forces. 
And even for younger women, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville properly. 
" Most people, who are in this area here, think: " oh, this city is nothing compared to other " Alondra Kenon said after the church last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a very nice city. " 
Here in New York, all speak fluently finance. 
However, nothing has changed. 
If tourists to Manhattan were far from the newsstand and giant screens TV Times Square, they do not make that they are in the œil of the cyclone. 
They never could not believe that in the glass offices and nest bee over their tète, bankers and managers of hedge funds who monopolize New York, the "worst day of work at the office" since the fall of 1929. 
The men continue to slip on the pavements, with their trolleys and their of muffins for the matinières meetings. 
The Latin are always between them residential buildings, like the mules, fifty top-of-the shirts hanged a yoke prepared on its shoulders. 
The office employees continue to queuing to buy their matinier sandwich the itinerant traders, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h during the week. 
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic reports until this afternoon when I décidai of opening a new savings account. 
Fortunately I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I découvrais to my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, some 20 people queuing. 
Not in front of the teller of the cashiers, or to withdraw from the case and make a payment, but in front of the counter of customer service, where the usual clients where their checkbooks, tourists asked the direction for the Macy shop, and the new clients opened accounts. 
Most of those in front of me, I apprendrais later of Starr, my "personal banker allowed", were all the tail for the same reason that me. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money savings accounts of so-called thrifts (such a building society), associations of credit, and the type of savings banks and local affiliates operating only in a state, and who say treat customers as their families. 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt. 
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank capital of 327 $ has made use of the syndic bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the week ending on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts with a value of 440 million $, désespéramment sought a buyer for the save. 
The office and employees of shops that are in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred money to a bank that seems reliable, is the most rescue on Wall Street. 
The New Yorkers any have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks. 
" I heard a woman in my local supermarket Chinese, talk on the telephone of Lehman Brothers, the bank has gone bankrupt, and its poor general director Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that it could be to criticise a colleague. 
And Lyn, the doorman in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or supply of my fruit and vegetables. 
She told me, after my visit to the bank. " I put all my savings in the market for monetary funds. 
"I have changed, I do not want to take risk." 
Muslim graves violated while Austria fluctuates to the right. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, who gave up the right wing of the party Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation of "cities against the Islamisation" to Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008. 
They are road signs of mosques removed in red. 
The Police accuses the right-wing extremists to have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austrian, the week ending the victory of political parties of the extreme right wing in the general election in the country. 
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the graveyard of Traun, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning ; this is according to the police, to a campaign. 
The offenders have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Etoile David ; the detectives but believe that this could be done with the feeling of hatred towards the extremist Muslim immigrants. 
The accident could be somehow linked to the elections. 
A spokesman for the Islamic local Community declared to be "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just for the religious month of Ramadan draws to a close. 
Austria think seriously about regaining his courage, following its oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two far-right parties who have chancellor played almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a campaign anti - immigration. Some of their slogans were seen, according to critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party which won more than 18 percent of the votes, has led his campaign against the headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed its opposition to the alaha food. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a brotherhood European" to prevent the rise of Islam. 
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a symbol of political Islamization of Austria and Europe. 
Polls and the analyses made immediately after the election, have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is shown by the majority of young voters who have made a difference, because worried about their future in the European Union. 
Gary Glitter banned travel abroad.

The magistrates imposed to Glitter a banishment of six months, after he had expressed to the authorities who have under control, its intention to go to Spain from France. 
The Kent Police to had given this travel ban last Thursday after having shown to magistrates the guilt of Glitter for sexual abuse as a child.

A spokesman for the Kent Police to said " the Kent police will do everything necessary to protect our children like those from abroad.

"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographe 
Neither they, nor by blatantly transgressing clothes. 
The essence of the great masters of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, released all tension for the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
On one hand the artist. 
On the other hand, the person. 
Inséparables except in privacy, in these times unknown to the general public, where we learn to intimate gestures and eyes stolen artists who don't care about on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixture in "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people" the théâtralité some stage with singers, dancers and guitaristes with the least experienced side of artists. 
In this project, the photographer includes the special iconographie the intoxicating spirit of flamenco from different angles. 
Incluse in programming of Mois the Photographie Fleming, the exhibition " reflects the international importance of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, more every day, " explains the creator, explaining that " intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people " " can be anyone, but after seeing the photographs, the observer can see that it is not the typical images of artists on stage. 
These people photographiées "on the street" are artists can pass on stage of the passion, the sadness, joy... in exciting the public. 
To capture of personality moments of these artists must not make photos on stage. 
They have a personality and a unique character. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to catch with the camera of personality moments of stars intoxicating spirit of flamenco. " 
With the "festival of popular song" Mines, Bauer in 1997 began a long journey for photographing the singers, the guitaristes or the danseurs with a camera to mark. 
They are portraits which, thanks to the choice of camera and the material, given the classic photograph. 
The œuvre different stylistic means breaks with the traditional side of the image, with a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of intoxicating spirit of flamenco according to Bauer: "music with very traditional roots changing and surprise every day". 
It is not the dance and music in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who ogre audiences with his art. 
The search of the essential and the magic has been the constant in this work for these days here at the El Fotómata gallery. 
The stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about 70 photographed artists. 
The project has turned to a anthologie the intoxicating spirit of flamenco, who is soon to be published in a book collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for the Bauer portraits of the led to repeat the idea two years ago with the "old portraits of sporting" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people," the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of the people, know the and enter their lives in a more or less long moment. 
I believe in the the portrait photograph is the most difficult kind. 
You trouves you in front of people, figures that sometimes you don't know or you leave only a few minutes to make a photograph. 
Despite these circumstances, as photographer, I always try my ideas reality ". 
This collection of portraits of the current intoxicating spirit of flamenco entitled "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people", is exposed to the El Fotómata Galerie, located at the top 20 of the streets of the Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie of Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.

The hispano-américain novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and whether books change life. "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who has said that it "has effects" and "makes people least similar", because it has asked the writers "not to give in to the frivolity" and accept their vocation.

"Sangre de Mayo", the dared challenge of Garci 
Drawing on the whether you are talking about our Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous battle of Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmographie with almost 15 million budget. 
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the œuvre the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players. 
The film for a period of more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will its exit in cinemas next Friday, which will be followed by a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures have done with this set "a dream of child" with Esperanza Aguirre, who instructed, three years ago, to turn a film memorial for the two hundred years on 2 May madrilène, something he has always accepted when the story is up to the national historical facts. 
The 15 million provided by the Commune de Madrid are for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the settings and clothing appropriate the atmosphere of "a Spain who has pressed leader in the fight, given that, the fight for independence led to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said. 
But the filmmaker regret not having obtained funding and the films "Captain Alatriste" or "the ghosts of Goya" - more than double that achieved for "Sangre de mayo", because he could not turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has worked for almost his entire career. 
The filmmaker of "Volver has empezar" influenced its usual way of working, on the stage of the players, with whom he has a habit of repeating before starting the film and that there is no cast, since it seems "humiliating" and believes that "the role of the film is to go to the theatre and cinema to be informing". 
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeated in front of the camera, as Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Four times candidate Oscar (he won a), Garci believes that the three candidates films representing Spain this year in the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo", "seven tables of French ping pong" and in the end the winner, "the blind tournesols", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "should be better known," he said. 
With this film Garci does not expect a price. 
"At first you think you travailles for posterity, and then you think you travailles for prosperity, and now you have only to make a film on top," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career. 
Isabelle Bayón puts himself in the skin of the young girl sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
A young girl sévillane will pay tribute to a young girl also sévillane. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three years will go live in London with his family. 
It was a young girl's free dance and expert eastern dancing. 
It was an exciting life, a pioneer of the release of the wife, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist and végétarienne and plaida for the abolition of the corset preventing the free movement of women. 
The life of the woman who was the history of the dance in Europe interwar, Isabelle has fascinated Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the Commission has proposed to interpret the young girl sévillane Tórtola Valencia and this was unbelievable." 
According to the young girl, " we are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking. 
The titles of his dancing made me think of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. 
So, "the dance of the butterfly" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "dance of the snake" some tangos. 
The dance was sensuous and they told me that my way of dance was identical to hers, " she says. 
The scene has been through two remarkable contributions: Miguel Poveda who chantera again Isabela in one of his spectacles, as he did in "the puerta abierta" ; and Professor Matilde Coral, which unusually has to work with the one that was his pupil. 
" Matilde transforms Tórtola in a mature person. 
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my œuvre and I honour ". 
The scene was also thanks to the music composition and guitares de Jesús Torres is Paco Arriaga, the popular song Michel Ortega, el Pulga is Moi's Morón ; the percussions of El Pájaro, and Rafa violates of El Viola and cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas." 
This œuvre tells also, in a way, the life of the woman who has exhibée in very remote locations, especially for the era, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also in Europe as a whole, because it was usually in London. 
"I wanted to remind the because I believe that these are women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights his œuvre," says Bayón. 
The show begins at 8 point 30 the theatre Lope de Vega 
The publication of the "newspaper of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "newspaper of a recently married Poète" in the Holy Stephen' church is in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez has married with Zenobia in March out, is part of activities by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for Littérature and their deaths. 
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the revival of this œuvre, with the International Congress held in New York, with the Museum of the Nobel restoration and with the migrant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: this peuplier light" which was inaugurated in May last year and who, having travelled in the various provinces Andalusian, will go to New York at the International Congress. 
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of "newspaper of a recently married poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the œuvre of one of the best-known Andalusian poets. 
America very fond less without Paul Newman 
" The God once perfect people 
Paul Newman was partly ". 
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in "no malice", and illustrates the hopelessness of the American cinema, and the whole of America, the face of the striking idea that Newman is not of this world. 
He had difficulty obtaining an Oscar 
He was no longer since 2007. 
Everyone knew that he was ill. 
It was a blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford began crying, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
No one was afraid to make ridiculous or exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, in the eyes of the American is low, in desperately looking for reasons of dignity. 
When times are tough and no reason to live, there is the human beings that admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda for like Paul Newman. 
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the drugs fight created in honour of his mother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
It was a victory for a country that has had difficulty against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration balayait Hollywood without attention or the nationalities or the passports. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that any James Bond died before him. 
Another Englishman, the like Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We have placed the high bar," observed George Clooney, who is perhaps the only today who is trying to break the screen like Paul Newman: by being very honnêt and with a serious private life and targets. 
It is not easy or possible in the jungle media these days. 
But there is the one who is trying, and Paul Newman is one example. 
After a divorce, he has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward were, to which he has been true even if the opportunities it not were not to be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside of home, if I have a beef in my ice?", was used to laugh. 
God, it is with pride at the meeting of his daughters with his fans on the ground, something that is not so usual in America. 
"Among all the major roles that he interpreted, he has never been more proud that the husband dedicated, in love with the father, the attentionné grandfather and philanthropist", disent-il. 
Madrid in the run-up to the Olympic Games in 2016 
And yes, the dream of a lot of us is that Madrid to hold the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it would be in 2016. 
But I wonder whether we are ready. 
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race that I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, it would be a éliminatoire note. 
But consider in detail and from the beginning. 
The mistakes are beginning with the withdrawal of dossards, which requires you to go ahead. 
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races). 
And no 
They were you going there only to take the dossard (first mistake, travel only for it) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that size is S is for the (second mistake, because I need a size XL) 
In what world are we? 
Est-ce-t-il because of the crisis that they decided to buy the small shirts with less fabric and the cheaper? 
Eh well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the races. 
Apart from the fact that we need to go is early to withdraw the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, furthermore, he should leave his rucksack to entry. 
It has lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races. 
Since there has had a long queue, competitions have started and we had not yet left the backpack to the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse. 
In addition, the rain has accompanied the expectations of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellion and attacks of the baraque. 
I believe that around 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, figurerons not even in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me, which I believe, has not properly marked the departure. 
Of course, if they were asking me to cite an example of perfect, this race I would certainly not to the idea. 
And I believe we can still dream to become the host city for the J.O. 2016. 
Microsoft seeks a while (virtual) 
The conference Émergentes Technologies MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Intelligence Artificielle with little intelligence but able to do some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move into the campus of the firm) in response to what it was asked during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "while" can know how many people in the place, which they are - including remember what jobs they occupy and listen and hear the key words of their conversations. 
But also bring in groups of conversation 
In the video presentation, the while detects a third person but she understands that she is not up to the group that is speaking with her and that she is not part of the company. 
She asks if she is here to visit someone and it said that it will respond in a few moments. 
All this without a blue screen. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for instance on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has been mentioned in more than a change of strategy for Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and there is no longer so many programmes involved. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster. 
It is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not been added and "perks" to Windows. 
The change in strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft is right, its operating system is important but also its software. 
When Google Chrome came on the web, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that the internet browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for the hardware and the software to understand. 
It is the same function that your wife or your husband when you have to say anything to your mother-in-law. 
It is true. 
It will never be but we must see the "death" of the system not operational as an absolute truth but as on a truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to operational system but increasingly the internet browser. 
You turn on the computer only to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time to surf the Internet than to go windows. 
Has that serve half applications provided with the system? 
That may be the least. 
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less that vista. 
Less cumbersome, overloaded months, less complex. 
For now, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need this, in effect, and I show you an example. 
The photo in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
The distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own tool research "your research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study found that 66 % of employees of Microsoft used Google to look for information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or 2010. 
Microsoft will surely to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after all, is increasingly a computer. 
But the launch of Android is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dear. 
The Marcel Fabuleux 
Pablo Picasso assumed the on the Côte d 'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was in the European Diamant blood of Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the Le Parrain of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the association of gay heavy-handed.

The English call is there but the Fabuleux Marcel Brussels stands out among all the other.

But it also produces sweat-shirt, of retro boxers, the cashmere cardigans in, ' in cotton trousers, the babies, the mini-shorts... 
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear. 
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear. 
They too have charm.

Repeat offenders of drink-driving will install the system is alcolock is 
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver that took more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, to install in her vehicle a system that cannot start the vehicle when drunk, or if he does not. 
The initiative was announced last June and it is now in the report by the Minister of State in which this initiative is regarded as a pilot project which will last for one year. 
The goal is rehabilitation driver in him offering rehabilitation over road. 
The Minister of State for road safety but also the Directorate General of the Routière Security and the Foundation Technologique Institute for Security automobile will participate in the initiative. 
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of motorists arrested for having done more than once when drunk, takes up the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it because it is a branché system on the vehicle which measure the rate of alcohol in the drawn-out and cannot start the car if the driver does not before ; or when the rates of alcohol driver is higher than allowed. 
The cost is higher than 1,000 euros and is the burden of the driver. 
In this respect, a study in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with the device were driving up to 65 % of offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year. 
This measure is the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to cope with this behaviour before they become criminal offences. 
And make it possible to œuvre, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary ways but, however, the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law. 
The mechanism is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form trade, although some industrial vehicles and office in already has one experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of the European Parliament will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party who proposes to establish in the school bus this system as was done in France.

Speaking in sleeping 
A few children speak during the night. 
I am not at those who wake up very awake in narrating something that happened the day before, but children who speak during sleep. 
The first time that happens it may surprise you, but in reality it is not important. 
It is a distortion benign sleeping called somniloquie. 
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents. 
It is true that there are more than one who speaks for the night. 
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child nothing more. 
There is no single cause which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other changes in sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors which were, the night énurésies (out at lunch to bed) or the sleepwalking, but this is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong found, situations stress or become agitated. 
In any case he is a little studied phenomenon. 
The intensity with which he happens is also very variable. 
It may be that he speaks with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, noises or with cries, the tears, the long speech... 
In the case where the somniloquie is very common, it would be good to see the child and consult an expert, to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem. 
We have said that it is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a apnée sleeping or stress). 
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventative measures such as: 
Try not to whip up the child before sleep. 
Therefore seek peaceful games and avoid programmes or television sets that are more or less violent. 
With very nervous and children who have difficulty relaxing, of of relaxation techniques can be used to help calm internally. 
This will allow the child to have a more restful sleep. 
As soon as the somniloquies are trying to stay calm. 
Rappelez you that they are harmless to the child and the next day he does remember most of what happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not réveillez. 
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Although he is talking about, he is sleeping and therefore is based. 
Rappelez you that if he is very anguished several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check causing so much anxiety among children. 
If you understand what he said (which is not usual), have not the temptation to question the to obtain information. 
You will get nothing, because in sleeping, it is not aware to organize his thoughts. 
Furthermore, you will hear what he said, but you will not know what he is dreaming, suddenly made attention to the way that you interpréterez information and the conclusions you draw from this. 
Never tell the child that you can question during the night to know his secret. 
Not even inform. 
This causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don't worry, there is no bad, it is an episode which lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern has finally returned to the victory at home after a long period of famine. 
Without a great match, the Jaunes and blacks have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a for the gain of the match. 
The pace was not very supported during the meeting where the attackers have found it difficult to express themselves. 
After a first attempt by the visitor Kauffmann captain who frôlait the lucarne on a from afar, Illhaeusern would take slightly ascendancy and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, the Roman foot or Diebold had chatouiller defending Dannemarie. 
In the face, a bloc in the middle and it was just the remuant Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The start of second half would be decisive with first signed two occasions Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to take a bullet rejected on the first attempt to Diebold (53 is). 
But the Illhousiens buteur will not be able to enjoy his long and will be forced to return to the changing rooms a dozen minutes later and leaving its coéquipiers in numerical disadvantage. 
But Dannemarie will not take and will not cause major problems in a illhousien 11 who has just fallen a bit for "compacter" his defence, except in the last few seconds of game when, after a big example, the ball was very close to the transversal. 
Sarkozy at the meeting of the angry fishermen

Faced with the threat of force of fishermen who have strongly Monday disrupted access of several Brittany and Normandy ports, President of the Republic has decided to go Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the Finisterre, to meet their representatives.

The sailors have already shown Monday their determination by burning, from the beginning, tyres and pellets to fuel depots port of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coastline and Channel, as the Sables of Olonne, the Vendée, where the trawlers were idle, or Le Havre, where a dozen boats blocked the movements of vessels. 
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, have stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery Donges. 
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions. 
The Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday of follow-up to the movement and its participation in lentrevue at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Brittany fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the national committee of fisheries, who did not support their movement.

Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that even a ship is achieved with a diesel below 0.30 Euro a litre.

The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House followed another over who, John McCain or Barack Obama, has won. 
Not surprisingly, the headquarters of Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed their own victory in this duel television would have been followed by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, has not been enough "brilliant" to enable it to halt its decline in the polls to five weeks of the presidential. 
The institute Gallup, one opinion poll published Saturday gives a lead of five points to Obama (49 % to 44 % to McCain), believes that this is the Democrat who has taken out of the game. 
Among the undecided voters, which are those that count, Obama has been successful for 39 % of those questioned, while 25 % of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the right expected to provide his colistier, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with its rival, Sarah Palin. 
" It would be a mistake to underestimate the. 
It is has good instincts ", but warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagénaire McCain has repeatedly to highlight his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naïve" of his opponent on these issues that were at the cœur of this first contest. 
"The Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times. 
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured. 
The angle of attack teeth yesterday in the Republican television advertisements. 
Obama has, to him, said that he was the future. 
Without stride, it was concise and accurate. 
He has put forward its ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the US image in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, though," explained, this weekend, a democrat spot accusing the Republican of not having taken full account of the impact of the crisis on the "American street." 
" During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, Obama denounced, yesterday, in 20 personnesrassemblées 000 for an election rally in North Caroline in a battante rain. 
He has not even made the words " middle class " or " workers. " " the financial rout clearly benefit Obama, who is regarded by the Americans as the most able to save the economy to the brink of disaster. 
"The week ahead could be a turning point," thought, yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, has compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict on eight years of poor economic policy œuvre by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Réaffirmant that he would even to cut taxes for 95 % of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also said that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health.

Has Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election, you?" 
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the capital of Belarus to reject in advance the outcome of the legislation. 
A few hundred Belarussians met Sunday evening at the polling stations closed on the central square in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had been announced, many young people were demonstrating against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation". 
Some are happy not vote: "why, since they will do what they want to my voice," said a young. 
They do not believe that the regime that has made good on foreign observers to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change. 
The sanctions, whose visa ban for 40 Belarussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered own observers. 
They were not according to the opposition. 
"We have been kept away from the electoral commission and observers have not been able to participate in the count," Iouri Potemkin has deplored, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of 12 parties. 
" This is a cosmetic change, underscores Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important that the popular vote, and among us, it is the executive power. 
If members of the opposition are in parliament, is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry to the parliament can mean space on television, the meetings in the regions and the draft laws. " 
The opposition must enter the political game because " we must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do not reform, we may become a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the electoral process fails to recognise the validity of the ballot. 
She points out that the participation figures seem too high, and that the increase in advance (26 % of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulation. 
" You have noticed that there was an election, you? Ask the Social Democrat leader Alexander Kazulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those that are best suited to power. " 
The silence of the night on the place in October. 
The television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcome their success. 
The meeting - Du course become blood 
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and its chairman, the Dre Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the suppliers of blood more security and efficient in the world. 
And more importantly, he has regained the trust of the public who had been seriously damaged by the scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, the national reserves blood managed by the transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross have been infected with the virus acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
In this drama and resentment of the public, the government of Canada has established in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Judge giant Krever, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster does not happen again. 
While the judge Krever tardait to file his report, some provinces have set up a committee aimed to plan a new management system of the blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has done this term. 
Following the Gélineau reports and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian company blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories. 
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38 % of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, remembers the Dre Décary. 
The situation was daunting. 
With efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we have regained the trust of the public, " says before proudly assert that at the start of 2008, almost 94 % of the population québécoise has confidence in Héma-Québec. 
The Décary Dre guard but in mind that "confidence is extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, it was in Europe there are many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells that takes the high since its founding in 1998. 
" And we do not know whether the disease was transmitted by blood. 
It was then relied on one of the main recommendations of Krever reports and Gélineau, that when we do not know and that a serious disease can lead, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterised by a degenerative brain inevitably leading to death, it sets up measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, people refused the blood of people who had been more than a month in the UK since 1980. 
However, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that the disease is transmitted by blood. 
The episode has shown that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense. " 
In 1999 came on the market a much more sensitive technique of HIV screening: the acid test of nucléique (TAN) to detect the presence of the virus in the blood donor itself and not the antibodies against the virus, which were the tests used until now. 
The TAN have helped to shorten the period silent, which stretches between the moment when the person had been infected and when the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technical, explains the specialist. 
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week. 
It has significantly reduced the risk that some donors are infected the and can detect. 
These improvements have helped to dramatically lower the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 million runs the risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
" In other words, this means that it will distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before that a case of HIV transmission through a blood product. 
I believe that we can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health, " says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know what pathogenic will emerge in the system. 
As recently as last year appeared on the island of Reunion the virus Chikungunya who, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must always be vigilant, " continues the Décary Dre prior to point out that in addition to a security supply, Héma-Québec must also provide a sufficient supply. 
" The needs are increasing because the population is aging. 
The anti-cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red cell or plaquettes. 
The ageing population also has an impact on the network of blood donors which brings together on average than 3 % of the eligible Québécois blood donation ". 
Anyone in health, aged 18 and meet the eligibility criteria but can give blood all 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14 % of people offering blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife, they will be excluded for one year. 
" With these 3 %, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they mature and can no longer give blood. 
But it is hard to convince people to give blood, but especially to remember and to encourage them to become regular donor. 
Life today is so rampant, you rarely find the time to spend an hour to give blood, " laments Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also of human tissue, including bone greffons, of heart valves, eye of globes and skin which is almost exclusively used for the serious burns. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Héma-Québec which also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia. 
" We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is take more than a thousand per year. 
We should begin to propose for transplants at the beginning of next year, " states the Décary Dre who described this programme to levy of umbilical cord blood as very popular. 
"Several so-called are disappointed not to have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the wherewithal to propose this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals in Quebec. 
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals

Kovalev gave the victory with the sole purpose of the shooting.

But I think it has welcomed the end of the match. 
It was a beautiful standing ovation ". 
Charest on North 
The prime minister does not trigger elections before the end of the year 
Sitôt General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest visited yesterday Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in the by-election today. 
"Repousser the limits of our last great northern border": that is the ambition long-term Jean Charest presented with visual strength while being broadly, at the end of the county council's Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin in pictures. 
Tournaient in loop, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, of mining, Quebec seen in "Google Maps," cards, etc. 
Of the major ways as election period. 
On the press, for that matter, the prime minister has refused to rule out that it would trigger elections this autumn, although he pointed out that it was very busy. 
The "North plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" for the prime minister claims to have for the Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speech by the first minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory the 49th parallel - had never been a presentation. 
The prime minister has yet to explain why the North was "a jewel at the huge potential," but has not given deadline, amounts of investment, or priority in the future projects. 
At most a few avenues of what could be more developed: notably hydro-electricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, has boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platine, however, money, iron, bow, and even diamonds", according to the list of Mr. Charest. 
This " territory twice large as France ", " this is home, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is among us, but it is with us, " he insisted, as to make it clear that it was asking a national founding myth. 
The Quebec has much built in its relations with the North, he said: the rush to gold in Abitibi, engineering québécoise, the Bay James. 
"It is up to us, it is our future," he added, after a dramatic pause to contemplate the immense card behind him. 
The North, 70 % of Quebecois of territory, includes a portion Labrador that the Quebec has always claimed, said the prime minister at the point of press. 
" It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government, " he said. 
The rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the north," he said in the Northwest Passage, which is open all year because of the melting of ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupy the territory is a must. 
And the people of the territory, the Premières and the Inuits? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would pay close attention to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young. 
Two former ministers from both parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former péquiste Member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with thirty communities. 
A US committee chaired by Benedict Koering-Joulin and Julie Boulet (Transport and natural resources) has an important place started work. 
The prime minister does not preclude a large meeting, "not necessarily" summit, but a time when "you will have a common vision." 
The North development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described the "vision" as continuity with the first Liberal minister that preceded it. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we thought that to make the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the recurring themes of the end of the week, which has begun Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout. 
"Of Godbout, who has created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that has made the quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydro-electricity, to Bourassa that has made the Bay James, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest. 
On the press, he cited another reference, conservative this, the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the draft hydroelectric dam in Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that the operation was scheduled for 2012. 
"It is us here, but I expect it to be," he told its militants, causing home of applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of triggering an election this autumn, what the law allows it. 
He stresses that it is done, notably with a mission of the board of the federation in China and a Québec-New York summit. 
The General Council of the end of week provided a platform at the Liberal leader with nationalists resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" who are past as a letter to the post: the PLQ clamoring for in particular the recognition "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
He also wants the Quebec appoints members of the Council of broadcasting and Canadian telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions made in Quebec. 
The opposition, has welcomed the macro-story North Plan with skepticism. 
The péquiste leader, Pauline Marois, has been the Neighborhood Development Nord-du-Québec that the government Landry was launched in 2001. 
In it, the Liberal government, in office in 2003, has refused to implement it. 
If he did, "it would be more advanced today" Mrs Marois commented alongside its candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot today), Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ said support the adoption of a North plan by the government. 
"But what we want, is that it is not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is on holiday today. 
Letters - a country he 
This is Mr. Vic Toews, former "justice" (ironically) in the cabinet Harper, who were last summer said of Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
Jeter and the shame on this woman who has been a constant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister on Stephen Harper himself. 
We are in front of a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, not to have brought back its national the concentration camp of Guantánamo. 
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that are accused. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its floor and lets in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Rappelons, for the record, that UNICEF, international and Amnistie Bar Association Canadian, notably, argue for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he has a fair trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that condone torture: never mind that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, possibly for ever after so many years of violence. 
It does not yet, but at the moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper continues to brandish and if empty in his mouth. 
Now is the time where no moral no longer exists: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the whim of a head of government so far minority (what will happen after the 14 October...). 
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that supports the Vertu, the Law and the Ordre: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, she is, in this renunciation, not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice director of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, that the largest gold of the world has brought a pursuit in defamation of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent public debate". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they deem to be, especially in the case of prosecutions in defamation, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate would lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own? 
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of the book black Canada must spend large sums to prepare their defense and fight, very unequal arms, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost no pockets of the mining. 
The tactic, in these struggles unequal, is often ruining the defendants to impose an amicable solution which bâillonnera opposition in addition to frighten anyone dare to look again at the question. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that she should have presented his vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is being done in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally by the exchange of ideas and not blows inflicted. 
It was therefore mining to open its books, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and financing teams of independent research that could shed light on the issue. 
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust the public and rejected out of hand the petitions and letters of support to the perpetrators of black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how it can ask a "public" debate while disregard for the opinions of the same audience? 
In the world of vice president, it appears that the word means only the highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians ; this is a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, even the critics are right to speak. 
What does not understand or does not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public supports the black authors and publishers of Canada is first and foremost because it rejects the brutal way of the mining. 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and prosecute, but on the basis of civilized exchanges arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also to table a formal notice of black authors of Canada but to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the surréel speech Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct assault on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to a democratic society. 
She denies, block, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate over the facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
While it is impossible to consider and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies in the world in a country like Canada, under penalty of prosecution repeated, who will be able to do this? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate and transparent, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the black authors of Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic world, which we belong, knows has long handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold makes clear that, contrary to what she says, she has no desire to open a debate. 
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments are putting in place measures restricting such abusive prosecutions. 
Rescue operation for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans are 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally come to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan's $ 700 billion American aimed at stopping the financial crisis rocking Wall Street for months still must be approved by both chambers of Congress. 
It includes: better control by the elected its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, and a look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the new right a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon negotiations in two days. 
"We have made great progress in terms of an agreement will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to them from the real economy and ordinary Americans in the ongoing crisis in Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"This is the crucial point: if we do not do that, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The talks had turned to the sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect that would cause another failure on investor sentiment. 
The time limit that was given was the opening of markets this morning. 
Associates late in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were in favour of understanding, without wanting to express their displeasure that you need to get this far. 
The Democratic senator Barack Obama has given the addition of some of the provisions in the agreement, such as the one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and that the salary of the leaders of the rescapées undertaken by the state. 
" When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because the irresponsibility of some, there is not welcome. 
But these measures are necessary, " he commented on the airwaves of American television. 
Asked about another chain to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see detail, but I hope so." 
" The broad lines that I have read [show] that this is something we are all going to digest and with which we can move forward. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, " he said. 
The 700 billion aims to buy with taxpayers ' money the bad debts, asset risk and unsaleable of US financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the collapse of a housing bubble that has led to the collapse of the mortgage (subprime) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and lead to a freeze on liquidity and the exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of Republican elected that wrecked the first draft of Understanding, last week. 
It believes to be out of this impasse since Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" companies in trouble only are insured by the government, rather than bought. 
To cut corners to everyone in Congress, it has also added a provision that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, he could implement new taxes to help recover it. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion which will add another 100 billion if the president needed the judge. 
The payment of other 350 billion should be approved by another vote in Congress. 
In exchange for assistance, Washington will holdings in companies rescued it will pay dividends in the event of profit and that it will sell when the turmoil will last. 
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the mortgages affected by the plan, and to set limits on the pay and allowances starting the leaders of the companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would be subject to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will take the green light. 
Voices have continued to rise yesterday against the project, both in the Republican camp democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington do not hear you," said to his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
" Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of taxpayers. " 
Animateur of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptical," the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents it differently, but comes to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors economy, including three Nobel, wrote to us saying: calls in Congress for not hurry and look closely at the path to take," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, was once again the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, all three of the Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was to acquire its rival in trouble since she lost 2 billion (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of mortgages at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
" This isn't lost money, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, it includes the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
This is something that savers and households now appreciate that times looks uncertain. " 
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on the way to nationalise another bank bullied by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take over the whole loans underway in the Bradford and Bringley bank, which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of mortgages. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customers accounts of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government should nationalise since the start of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Mort a committed icon 
Its beauty in the eyes of 'Azur was long its asset card, some would say its weakness. 
If was released from the narcissique mirror, the American actor at the charmer smile? 
Yes and no. 
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was sinking source have also far-removed from the register of power who actually giving rise to the real sacred monsters. 
But what great long-distance athlete! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years old, from a lung cancer in his ranch of Connecticut, remains one of the last icônes of American cinema of good years. 
Less monumental that Brando, who he was and he was long a rival to the screen, the more cautious in its game, certainly more fragile, but also great champion of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions. 
The blood mixed often beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin. 
These European roots will a glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive egos, ultimate sign of quality. 
Because it is projeta a freedom-loving country of self made man, in the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied under the dramatic art at Yale fréquenta then the Actor' is Studio in New York, prior to the theatre, television, soon cinema. 
The same man who milita for civil rights was also the auto pilot who classa second to 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, a sex symbol, although a member of a couple model trained since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward were. 
Also disappear with the grey areas of this secret, low-key star, committed, allergic to smoke the show-business, which is not entirely holes the puzzle. 
An honest man, in the truest sense of the word. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought boggles the cinema goers this weekend, when talk a its major roles on the black screen memories. 
More than a century of a seventh American art constantly changing has around him. 
Return to bully remember the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Chatte on a burning roof adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closest to us (1990), to its sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage which does not meet all its promises. 
Many other Paul Newman are history. 
The Rocky boxeur Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Dr Likes (Marqué by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, continued after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956. 
This crook appealing in the brillantissime The Sting (The Arnaque), Oscar for the best film in 1973. 
Player of bitter and ping pong avenger by in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume in the figure on the return in The Color of Money to Martin Scorsese, who won him in 1987 its single Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face throughout the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
The times they are lining up through its journey. 
The young are particularly through the cultissime Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977), by Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of Ice Hockey unorthodox. 
Its fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coen brothers. 
With a final role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the circle was completed. 
Against several legends cinema who lâchèrent soon enough the profession, Newman will be remained a long time back in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its on, its good and its concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded, not without humour, " as a challenge in " the underplaying " considering its benefits him too much. 
The profession has not always been kind to the Paul Newman in which the roles fell long all cooked in the tooth. 
He played but less often young people first that the marginal: névrosés, alcoholic, swines or desperate, including its perfect features reflétèrent tendencies and the revolt. 
As director, Newman révéla of poorly known facets of its true both sensibility. 
Its Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (in the novel the Canadienne Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward were in the main role, traçait an end portrait female of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott by overdose him dédia his film Harry and His in 1984, of shame and sorrow. 
Among the rain of tributes that déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, disappointed: "its presence has made my life and this country better." 
Générosité, love the existence are distress features of the player disappeared. 
Par-delà his career of legend, disappears a great campaigner for civil rights, the environment, the independent cinema, a excesses of Hollywood. 
It has seen its much binette allowed to grace the pots vinaigrette, sauces, titbits and other food, considering the procedure to be in poor taste, although initially joke. 
The profits from these sales were nonetheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than sit on its myth, is committed to the end. 
It has left its five girls a letter containing these phrases: " always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for its good star. 
It was a privilege to be here. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist if lucid and generous. 
Model citizen, in sum and above. 
That could well make Zuschlag & Society in their factory to bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will start the hearings relating to the criminal procedure, against János Zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanently and regular, having led the particularly damage. Other charges were held against them, for example, false and use of false. 
According to the Crown Prosecution Service, money from subsidies, was spent on personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
Money from the state and municipality, about 65 million HUF in total, was on the one hand into the coffers of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to earn money obtained subsidies by issuing bills costs, behind which no real provision was provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were false. 
For them, they are - of bills in Józsefváros market, while fabriquaient stamps to Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies that would be on bills, it was decided, among others, over the touring province North Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag. 
According to the evidence of the latter, he must identify pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked for a bill, on the model of which they other bills that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, and the Municipalité capitals for access to subsidies. 
The majority of the bills was created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, which according to our information, dealing mainly to produce the necessary documents to obtain subsidies. 
In a "circuit to spot," one of the choice of Lados was a bistro. 
According to the two bills from the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pontos Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, he would have been impossible that so many people have this place, at the same time. 
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which later will bear the name of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért, grouillait of forms and substance. 
A pension, based in Badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three rooms, and maximum ten people could night. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers. 
Issuers of bills to these also fell on the excesses, when they mentioned society Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Otreca. In their accounts, or the name of Jobb Jövőért, or the Hoppá indication, according to the information to the public prosecutor's office. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, said the site hvg.hu that when the public prosecutor has called and showed the bills, he has been able, immediately, that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp." 
It was: " beyond the form, the fact that the bill, 100 people were housed there, not very truthful headline either, since this establishment has only 11 chambers, which do not have as much room. 
In addition, the bill also mentions of the meal, and the restaurant is closed for a long time. " 
Issuers of zealous bills are not informed about the travel agencies Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising travel abroad. And, naively, they have said ' stays in Hungary on bills to settle in cash, which also runs counter to the accounting practices of the agency. 
Of surcroit, as it became clear during the investigation, they also ajoutèrent VAT on these documents, while the benefits for travel activities, including the destination is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT. 
Similarly, the rate of VAT on four bills established in the name of the Hôtel Révfülöp on the agenda Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the benefits of society does not bear a VAT 25 % as indicated, but a value-added tax of 15 %. In addition, the employees of the hotel is that emit printed bills, while the false were drafted in hand. 
The survey by the Crown Prosecution Service shows that the "emitters" have also made mistakes by mentioning as the provision of road transport goods, the company sending bills could not exercise, given that his profile was the investment advice. 
In addition, it is also for defects forms, such as bills types of inadequate and counterfeit pills, that the invoices to the order of Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of 21. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pontos proved false. 
Just as in the case of society Ravenna Bt. or sports training of Kunfehértó, who both deny being the authors of the invoices on their behalf. 
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the group Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to make a meal home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidateur society denies issuing this bill. 
Bills set deliberately 
A group of other issuers bills is made up of those who were fully aware that they were asked to make the fictitious invoices. 
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a bill to the order of the Együtt Foundation has Harmadik Évezredért, for a total of four million HUF. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false bills by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi. 
Likewise, has cooperated with the Zuschlags, society Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, issued bills on the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Association Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, for a total of about five million HUF, but behind which no provision has been provided. 
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices were cancelled afterwards, however, the agencies have avoided mention it in their accounts. 
This category of companies issuing bills is that companies directly linked to the accused. 
Thus, the administrative representative of the general director of the Delta Trió Kft society., caring trade fuel and vehicles, whose headquarters is in Budapest, but there was nowhere to be found, Iván was Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment, to the tune of about 18 million HUF. 
According to the survey, these devices have been bought by the Cash Investment Kft. society Kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since 14 September 2005. 
The director of the society was a man of Romanian origin, which Iván Kubatov would also sent documents in connection with the company, between 2002 and 2005. 
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued bills on the order of Atlasz societies, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and he has earned their countervalue. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian builders created companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment BT. 
In reality, none of these companies do worked, that the accused explained by the fact that they had not been working. 
It is served when even these companies, as at the request of Maître Zsolt Szente, coaccusé and editor acts of companies Foundation, established bills in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations. 
Kubatov gave bodies, 15 bills in total, made by companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 HUF million. 
The Crown Prosecution Service believed that 10 % of the world are indicated on bills and VAT in the pockets of Kubatov. 
The man has even used the company Bt. Szi-Beri to fictitious bills that have been used in the grant application of Biztos Pontos. 
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért have applied for a grant from the organism public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (MRI). 
They got this subsidy to a total of two times 500,000 HUF, but these have not been used for the objectives set out in demand. 
To prevent this does know, five fictitious invoices received society Works Team Kft. were presented to the MRI. 
Moreover, these bills that have been found during the raid in the office of Kemecsei Árpád, the Ministry of Education. 
At the hearing, some of the accused relatera the method of manufacture of bills, as it was before the public prosecutor's office earlier. 
What could be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag itself, decides to lift the veil on history. 
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and though he has promised repeatedly telling detail, it has not yet done. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a great portion of 50 million HUF, Zusi would only the hat. 
Today, it is probably offended, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a relief to the conditions of detention, are constantly on deaf ears. 
While those who have caused far greater damage, and the authors of economic crimes not repairable, roam freely or at least, expect their own home the end of the procedure. It does not have that opportunity. 
The psychology of the auction: why dépense-t-on more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the commodity. 
Researchers in neurology and in economics from the University of New York managed to update the neurological basis and economic known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, human beings want to keep up in this kind of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer to even pay too high a price. 
The research has tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this type of "game" with the help of auctions experimental. 
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in an auction playful, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), the researchers studied the active brain areas of experimental subjects. 
In the two games, the participants could make money, but during the auction an important element of which is more than a third, all under the syllabus strokes, called striatum, were moving to intensive at the loss of the game. 
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the price rise is with the flight to the violent reaction of the striatum. 
Has the support of their theories, economists members of this group of researchers continued analyses of financial supervision. 
In them, three groups surenchérissaient a partner, in various circumstances. 
They have simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question, and they have done them. 
Another group, they have promised that if, in addition, released winner of the game, then they would receive $ 15 more, in rewards. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group lost money, if they lost the bidding. 
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was put in on the victory, while in the other, to failure. 
In demonstrating the hypothesis of neurologues, members of the team of players "against failure" were prepared to put higher than those made by the control group and the group "for the victory." 
" These results cannot be proven by any existing economic theory. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena noted at auction by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk. 
The only imaging methods of neurological helped remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now, on a third explanation. " - has seen Andrew Schotter, Professor in the Faculty of economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when should consult a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the top causes of death. 
It is estimated that up to 100 miles patients carrying the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is the fact that often patients don't know that they are carrying the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name for infections that affect the liver and caused by different virus. 
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaunisse are features, but the pathogens and caused diseases differ. 
The virus hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and organic liquids (sperm, vaginale secretion, salive). 
For passengers, it is advisable to get inoculated against the virus A and B. It is no vaccine against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A are two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, in general, accompanied by a poor state general, weakness, of ills of stomach and nausea. 
Then develop on the skin and the white one jaunisse œil visible, the selles become clearer and urine takes a more foncée colour. The cure can take two to three weeks. 
Throughout the world, every year, a million people are the most serious form of the disease, such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. 
Most patients do not know reached the virus, because the gene pathogenic destroyed of underhand way the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appeared after 20 to 30 years. 
Therefore, prevention early is very important, and regular screening tests. 
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who have suffered a transfusion before 1991, consumers and the tatoués. 
Currently, figures to 200 million patients suffering from a chronic hepatitis type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by an examination routine in the laboratory, it is advised to consult their doctor treating from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be healed, if detected in time. The virus could be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer has warned. 
On 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representing patients around the world. 
His aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the liver chronic, caused by the virus, about the causes of its development and on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
The growing in God has he less pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, the religious belief would work as a kind of painkiller, which would have helped to make the death more bearable martyrs Catholic. 
The Telegraph British newspaper published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford have made an interesting experiment analysing how the belief in God could influence the tolerance for pain in humans. 
In the context of this experience for the bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists have been subjected to electric shock therapy, while each observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to rule out a large part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technical palpation of the human brain, it has also been able to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academics meeting each other, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from various sectors of the university. 
More precisely, the experience is as follows: an instrument issuing sparks and broadcasting electro-shocks is set on the left hand of experimental subject. 
The researchers asked the participants of the experience of watching a sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci at 15ème century. 
Researchers at the root of this experience had hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evokes a state of faith among believers, and the choice of painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect. 
The experimental subjects have spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, meanwhile, have received 20 ECT in four part is already, as we watched the paint religious theme, is the more general issue. 
Catholics have declared that the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as somebody that you "take care" and they "calmés, peace and the invaded." 
Has the paint of religious issue, they have reported 12 % less pain in when they were watching the œuvre of Leonard. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who had taken part in the experiment, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, among atheists, provided to find the appropriate photo. 
"We should find a picture which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father", said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Bishop vicar, welcomed the results of this research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, really change our personality," said Wright. 
After these excellent results, it is more than the question of what the effect would be on the regulation of pain issues if one shows the believers a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of arms? 
Does the sight of a Virgin Mary better would better results? 
You are what you divulgues to your subject 
At its tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of the people in the same way as the sky over their heads. He knows where they have spent their summer holidays, which experts they consult and what their interests. 
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the company. 
While regarding the sceptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, they do not see the bulk of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main aim of Google is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary for the founders of Google to uphold their initial aim was as follows: "recueillons in a system all the information in the world!". 
According to the leader asked Google, after ten years of a chamboulement world, they are still early days of their aims to deal with all the information. 
The question: will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like to see Google can answer questions like "what could I do tomorrow?" or "what is the work would be the better?". However, the software can respond to that question, simple at first glance, that the day when they know enough about users. 
It is not entirely clear to all users that words used for research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer which sends research and pages then consulted by interested people are listed. 
Through the program Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can consult what they have sought, what they have cliqué. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommandations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give answers much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and registered preferences. 
What happens if someone is using my information against me, if you look at what is my work? Ask users, who see the monopoly of information from Google. 
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society which can give rise to fear, and it is not the compunction, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can cause a among Internet users contre-réaction. 
But it is a fact confirmed that the desired terms are not only registered, but justified cases, they are sent to a third, and in this kind of legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The most spectacular example of these days is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google has sent to the Brazilian government information that he had collected on the public page called Orkut, paving the way for identification. 
Internet users concerned with human rights could breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, on its head arm with the EFF electronic legal protection, has proved its right to the court with the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request secret FBI, of any kind. 
(In the same time, the federal government has achieved with some success 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 research that he had won by the strengthening of the law on the protection of children, voted several years ago. But in the end, he fails to get the lists of users research private, and the full list of websites and key words of the past two months.) 
The trial of Google is quite contradictory: he is criticised by those who fear the transfer of their personal data, because they believe that their intimate and their private area suffer when they are beginning to use the Google services. As a result, they address them in the spirit of rebellion that manifesto against multinational companies proud of their conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the US geek culture and its "sauvageons" with the fans, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries are in Google the next generation of big business, the "fashionable corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, classified as invader of the world because of Windows, and this, even though both are fighting for the same goal. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users of identification code, not request for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programmes, continually refreshing, has a much more accessible, younger and more cool, faced with the practice of giant's official software. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and Internet, and that the Web 2.0, the key word most proclaimed in recent years, draws just behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something that cooperation, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and we use the channels of communication available to us, and for the extent of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: it is exposed. 
A young, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, of Xanga Facebook to, and it can even link them to other benefits, such as to Twinter, or last.fm, listant its musical habits. Then, it can connect to a system of prosecution, as FriendFeed or young Blip.fm. These can also take blogs, in which automatically are their most recent gallery of photos they stock on Flickr or Picasa. 
While you can read many examples, such as the girlfriend who understands easily to the photos in the morning, taken by the ring of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or society that has dismissed one of his employees, in the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog on the top management, we may be on to something: the word privacy is completely to reconsider these days. 
Anyone who lives a life online, consists of what it shows itself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of young people today. 
That wants to hide something, or at least, to try to circumvent the Google monopoly, can (starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the system Google search, but, at the same time, leaving intentionally no sign). 
The number of people who, deliberately, does not have on public pages so that it is not possible to recover the, is not insignificant. The Google services online, via the processor treatment image, reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to enormous parks of servers and not assemble our best profile, having existed to date. 
The public expects, without actually hide, when Google dévoilera his true nature. 
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel ($ 124 billion) and Coca-Cola ($ 110 billion). The AdWords and AdSense advertising fields threaten the turnover of the advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of increasingly important cause serious headache not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programmes. 
However, critics observers find, along with all of this, the contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the employees ' protests, after it has doubled the price of the corporate mother and after that the company has seen too expensive restoration multiple daily, taken any day. It pales next to the fact that in 2006, Google has assented to the Chinese government and the terms of their agreement, the company detect all results harming the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are not announced until they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and years to come, they will move the world on new points. While some believe that the project to scan and filing of books and magazines Google is so important dimensions that society will soon find themselves facing the Supreme Court of the United States, other scenes in his system Health, because in it, we can build a comprehensive medical benefit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a genetic data can give a good raw material to the next generation of fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwelliens demi-tons, described the future in which a man could be approached so outrageous alone through data from Google. 
Two miners helped remove traces the double homicide of Ózd 
"The police summoned two minors to be questioned in the case of the double murder of Ózd. According to suspicions based, they helped to remove traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the police station Borsod department. 
Young people have recognised the facts they are accused. For now, they are charged with complicity. 
The two miners, which, according to the information MTI (Agency Télégraphique Hungarian) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The accessory to murder is causing a detention of up to five years. 
The suspect in the double homicide of Ózd, a young man of the old corner of 23 years, has been placed in temporary detention, Sunday. 
The charges included against him are murder multiple, committed with deliberately and interest. 
During the investigation, it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a lot of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not want to settle its debts and it is for this reason that he drew his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site of Ózd where he was killed, and the girl this man, aged 9 years old. 
According to the information MTI, the young man was premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he would commit crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The purse Warsaw made a proposal to buy the Prague Stock Exchange 
The stock exchange values Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion kronor Czech, to buy 100 % of the shares of the stock exchange values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the stock exchange values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have done despite the fact that, previously, the Czech Republic have excluded the purse of the Warsaw circle of new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the purse Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99 % of shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to secede from more than 60 % of its shares in a few months of activities. 
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of Polish is the most high which has so far been made for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic exchange NASDAQ, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that one of those involved, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new owner less, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future. 
The value of the stock market in Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion kronor Czech by the specialists of the market. 
On the basis of a settlement between shareholders, some 90 % of papers would be sold. 
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of contributions, followed by the 14.7 per cent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding S.a.r.l. Four with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the standpoint of the European press 
In their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis, worsening by the day, newspapers leaders in the European press already refer to a "second 9 / 11." 
"The global financial disaster, it is the American President" - accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "the president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a rush, to help a desperate situation..." 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned the billionaire Warren Buffetts - hard-driving businessmen, it is more appropriate to talk of a second 9 / 11. 
Part of the press madrilène also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the view of the newspaper El Mundo, the shortcomings of the political leadership there who led the global economy to the brink of collapse. 
The danger of a collapse of the US financial system is accroit every day, and afterwards, the whole world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, but the vote in Congress, a real threat, that Washington does not propose to political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place. 
We cannot ignore the threat longer - underscores the Tages-Anzeiger Geneva. 
Some states still can be a lifeline to their titubants financial bodies, and with money from taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if more banks collapsing like dominoes, then neither financial resources, or new improvisations will not be enough. 
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union are few cases of their national self-interest, and centralising control over financial markets divided. 
Not that Monday, the weakened financial bodies have received more than 100 billion - recalled the Viennese newspaper, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers also will have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, similar to the US with the aim of finding a solution to the crisis, are becoming more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really worked the crisis, which, as a tsunami, through, to the other, the old continent. 
The "rescue forces wearing" should not use immediately 100 billion, however it would be good if they notaient in which case it would be reasonable to affect taxpayers ' money, with the goal of preventing major damage. 
The intelligent car following the theft of bourdon 
What method would be best for developing technologies to avoid an obstacle, if not the imitation of a detector obstacles that already exists in nature? 
For example, the bees. 
In the astonishing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the bourdonnantes bees have given the idea of strategic departure engineers from Nissan, to inspire them about the way they need to develop the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a auto-robotisé command system to bio-inspiré, kind of BR23C, he has equipped qualities of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system that can avoid obstacles. 
In its flights, each bees is its own area, of elliptic form, which in reality, is very similar to our hull of secure protection - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand. 
The œil to aspects of the bees plays an important role, because it is able to see in all directions, in terms of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the œil to facets, engineers have raised the idea of télémètre to laser. 
It identifies the obstacles in the way of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, he assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, who transforms into manœuvre of avoidance immediately. 
The perception of the obstacle is taking place in a split second. Second, the mini robot car, imitating the movements of the bees, immediately change the direction of its wheels the shift from a light enough to avoid the collision. 
Unlike any system that currently exist, this manœuvre of avoidance takes place entirely instinctively. 
"If he was not the case, the mini robot car could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratoire Mobilité and car robotisée. 
It must react instinctively and instant, since this technology is the most vulnerable and most internal layer of protection, a layer which for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
This whole process must reflect the bees to prevent other bees. 
The process should take place overnight œil. 
By contrast of bees, the difference cannot be upwards, downwards or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this way, to the place of endless combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we have been able to use the rotatif movement, speeding up and slowing down as manœuvres the mini robot car 
The BR23C using polymère Lithium batteries which are light and whose concentrated energy is greatest, which makes their living longer than in the Lithium-ion version. 
According to Andoh, this is the knee-jerk reaction intelligent is vital, not the data processing, let alone the ability to store. 
This mechanism must deal with a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them. 
There is no need to store and react with the intuitive logic based on data from previous manœuvres. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilo-octets memory in continues. 
We do not need memory capacity of gigabits, or even méga-octets. 
This is the first step towards the design of technology for the instant avoidance. According to the estimates of Nissan, this system will its entry in cars produced in series in the next ten years. 
Another application could be its incorporation into the satellite navigation GPS system, so that he can lead the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles in its path. 
It even has a name the baby out of price 
The written version of the economic rescue plan of $ 700 billion, to buy the dubious loans banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
In the first round, half that amount will be spent. 
Reuters announcement that over new debates is extending until after midnight, on Saturday, local time the east coast, the Congressional leaders agreed on the existing controversy for days and days, about the rescue plan for a total of $ 700 billion. 
"We have taken a serious step" - declared Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairman of the US House of Representatives, that there is more to put them on paper agreements. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be put in œuvre. According to Pelosi, there is no question, here, the bailout of Wall Street, but to make the workings of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday night at 20h, local time of Washington (this Monday to 2h in the morning, according to the local time Central Europe), but did not bring forth a dramatic rise in the stock markets. 
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding on behalf of law of economic stabilisation emergency 2008. Second, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush has spoken to Pelosi, then, the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with the advanced attacks last night, and we are very appreciative of the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House. 
Moreover, the program differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she, mentioned that the $ 700 billion would be spent at once, to buy securities on dubious loans. 
Dorénavant, maximum half the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will serve as the secretary to the Treasury to buy bad debts on banks, while the use of $ 100 billion more will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also take part. 
Spending in the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress. 
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will implement a combined strategy: he will, at the same time, buy bad debts, securities on dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of debt "toxic". 
The people in charge of the ministry said that the takeovers can take place in the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule provides an opportunity for the companies involved, to take part in an insurance scheme, where the secretariat Treasury guarantees the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damage. 
Henry Paulson has said that the bill provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars to the pressing needs of the financial system, the vast buyback of dubious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system triggers the collapse of a major financial institution. 
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready to law enforcement, as soon as it is signed" - he said. 
By contrast, the leaders of the banks are in bad stances and waiting for the state aid can expect their redundancy payments, called simply golden parachute lands Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The wages ceiling is mentioned in many case. In addition, the restrictions depend on how the secretariat Treasury proposes its assistance to the company. 
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury secretariat repurchased in an auction, they prélèveront extra tax on the golden parachute, unless the president of discredited bank based in retirement. 
Immediately after the purchase of the bad debts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders should not be exaggerated. 
So that the image is complete, he must add that the golden parachutes existing have not been modified. The ceiling is that the new contracts, to motivate and participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings are in place on the allowances of Directors-General - has commented on the chairman of the committee in charge of financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank. 
In addition, the state has a right to buy shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of falling taxpayers, since they may even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved rebound on their legs. 
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal which will rule on the ways in which the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there was obviously those who expressed their doubts in relation to this plan. 
This does not mean that the American people have mandated, this does not protect the taxpayers ' dollars - said the Republican lawmaker from California, Darrell Issa. 
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur believe that they are the same people who are taking measures, those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Obama and McCain both support the plan to rescue banks ' 
On Sunday, Obama like John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American political parties, have secured the rescue plan for their support of the government's $ 700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary. 
After negotiations are marathons that have gone on for days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration have finally announced, Sunday at dawn, they reached agreements in principle on the rescue plan for banks. 
This funding plan, aimed at the thawing of the crisis on Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central question of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are the same, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, with the forward economic issues, Obama again managed to procure a bit ahead. Ahead of McCain, achieved with the appointment of Sarah Palin as colistière just after the Republican convention, has melted. 
At a meeting of campaign in Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress vote quickly the law on the rescue plan of 700 billion. 
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection that also supports. 
"Now we need to act, with responsibility (...) threat your job, your savings, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people. 
He has not failed to describe the economic ideas of McCain's outdated.

Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House vote on the bill as early as Monday. 
The magazine's press German language territory 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only the cœur party that voters have become more aware and evokes the Der Spiegel, the low score CSU in the Bavarian country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the Internet edition of the magazine of left-wing German information, Franz Walter analysis the causes of the CSU dramatic defeat in his article entitled "the revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers." 
According to this political scientist acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber takes office. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed Bavaria for decades and now, it is these very modern citizens who are turning their backs. 
The time change is also the problem of any democracy Christian, and by extension, that of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, has been a process that was likely that, just ten years: the unquestionable dominance of national party ended. 
There is this decade, in 1998, the CSU is ramassait with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This was repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag 2005, when the mentioned so Stoiber. 
The blame can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring her parents", put in place in the region of consistent way by the allegations. 
It is 40 years since the sociologists announce that they have cheated on pace. However secularization, the results of education and the establishment of German in the north and the east in Bavaria, developing, cannot remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and entêtés. 
It is amazing that in recent weeks, it is the classic citizens groups who have rather distant CSU, such as the independent, artisans, holders of the box and graduates of higher studies. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 %. 
Die Press (diepresse.com) 
In his article entitled "which? With who? The party president to take on the reserve in the face of questions from the coalition," the Austrian newspaper conservative is the situation of the domestic political confusion has installed after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian Socialist SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservative ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs. 
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiating. The Greens want to not even agree on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now revolves around the coalition ; in the debates to public television, the party leaders have barely suggesting their cards. 
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is actually possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the Socialist partnership. 
The question that we imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current president of the Austrian People's Party, as Vice Chancellor, remains open from Faymann. 
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected. 
A replay of this combination is out of the question. 
Molter reacted cautiously to the proposals of the red. 
As he said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the Austrian People's Party. 
In his party, the choice of the opposition or joining the coalition is a completely open issue. These points should be debated in the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president's BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals. 
"To prevent the coalition of the red and black, we are prepared to take responsibility for government" - said Haider. 
Járóka said: we need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began, the European summit in Paris, for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his presentation message in front of the House, as one of the main mouthpieces of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz the European People's Party, has drawn attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law which affects most Roma children and this fact, one of the main obstacles to their success in life. 
In the name of the French presidency, this high-level conference was open on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Sociales Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, there is the European social partners, as well as the most senior representatives of the legal protection and civilians European bodies, in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the office's press Group of Fidesz MP Party People's, Járóka warned that alongside distinctions in the recruitment, the Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, following their qualifications. 
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma have no qualifications of secondary, and as a result of a poor quality basic education, only a tiny fraction has the ability to get a degree of higher education". 
Furthermore, Járóka insisted that education as basic law of human beings plays a key role when the other basic rights. 
Investment in early education of Roma children means the economy of the member countries of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, we need to be aware of these reports in a circle the widest possible, between Roma and non-Roma. 
Indeed, earlier a Roma child starts school, the more it increases their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market ; for taxes paid from his income and consumption, it is part of the state budget. 
"By their nationality from the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected education of poor quality and sectarian." - Lívia Járóka pointed out. 
According to the MEP, a collaboration of the European Union geared towards a goal and action is needed to immediate speed up the process of desegregation schools. For this, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. We must give them opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka. 
In the name of the "European year for Equal of Chances" guaranteed for all, the purpose of the summit for equal opportunities in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single platform to support measures for equality of opportunity and in the fight against discrimination, targeted at the European level and at the level of member countries. 
CSU: thanks for a period of transition 
It is in October that the decision will be made on the fate of the duo failed Huber-Beckstein 
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, our minds are not yet fallen, and the debate over the personal issues to summits of the Bavarian CSU was postponed. 
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain them. The question is how long will the last thanks? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a loss of catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the party congress exceptional, held last weekend in October. 
The members of this very criticised pair have, at least, felt that they were not specifically to their seats. 
Thanks to this, to appease the angry members of the group and the base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
There is this five years ago - it is true, even in the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the socio-chrétienne union had 60.7 per cent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU was the "single sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 % of GDP. 
However, conservatives have always strongly in this region of the south, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal restructuring of the party, the vice president and the federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, described as a possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, who instigate discussions to tâtons with liberals of the FDP, as well as the Universities, trained Electeurs along the right values, about a possible coalition government in Munich. 
A mockery strange fate has been with the list of Electeurs Universities, between the Gabriele Pauli in the legislation, which the measure against Stroiber was the possibility of coup carried out by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then deal with the very bluntly ambitious municipal political wife. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now were the strings behind the scenes, will receive an active part. The former head of the regional government and the former president CSU, appointed on 28 September as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
On Monday, Huber has launched a scathing remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have earned much more support from the party brother. 
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the Bundestag election, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor if they call up one way or another, with a common, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, difficult to hide his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground CSU influence do not negative the grand coalition in Berlin. 
Which is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of Social Democrats always hard. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0 
No member of the opposition came to parliament after the election Sunday. 
According to the Russian observers, this is a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who assure him prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is by illegalities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections. 
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people is very well opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition between its forces under the name of Forces Démocratiques United (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of the amendment to the constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of a few members of the opposition in parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ renounced his boycotting originally envisaged. 
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent on an increasingly Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where the political Belarusian described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus is a credit to the reduction in natural gas imports from Russia, always more expensive, and has made the transition from society Beltransgaz, owner of the gas driven across the country, happened in the hands of the Russian. 
The fact that the OSCE, the evaluation of the campaign, has stressed the positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of the candidates for the opposition, referred to a prior appeasement. 
However, the OSCE's release Monday already challenging the campaign, in which most of the candidates for the opposition could not appear in the media, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is still a palpable improvements in the political system: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is prepared to small confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and the separate Abazzia Georgia. However, Russia with Belarus form a confederation on paper, sees the two independent territories for a month. 
"We took two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was initiated between Belarus and the EU" - Alexander Milinkevich told the newspaper. 
According to the candidate opposition presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that remain this way, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which carries no weight, to get even a single opponent." 
The opposition does not action protests given results. It rather trying to get his message on the need for economic reforms to the voters. 
"Of course, we have a lot of concern that side: we need to give our opponents newspapers in Russia, the local authorities we put a spanner in the works for the broadcast, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the election, even in the circle of elderly" - Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its main result, the pensioners ' most officially supported is most really as appropriate. 
"Because of the debt of the country and increase the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, is evoking the silence of a cemetery is, is no longer a matter of time" - think Milinkevich. 
Unlike the politician from the opposition, the Russian observers have called the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people don't believe in words, but deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of Belarus voters. 
Brunetta: "from today, breakfast before the work". 
Never, in the history of the Palais Chigi, not only had the revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from " today, has been in force this new measure against fraud, against whom and will then drinking coffee at the bar during working hours. 
The new good-for-nothings anti - was presented by the Minister for the Administration Publique, for Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving doors - tells Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services" precise Minister. 
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency. 
"This is the reformism" also highlights Brunetta. 
The installation of all of the Presidency Council is complete with the Palais Chigi. 
According to Masi, " the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic standpoint. 
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, assures the Secretary-General: "it is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all." 
In short, more breakfast during working hours ; more coffee or growing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests smile, "a good cappuccino to 7h in the morning is a good and healthy resolution". 
At a conference in the Supérieure School of public administration 
Rome, Minister communicates that " " in three months, the sickness absences of public employees were reduced by 50 %, 60milles workers in a year. " 
And he adds that it is essential to make it more efficient, the Administration Publique. 
Italian, " whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in recent 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of public workers, have joined together to challenge the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of Codacons. 
"" while the minister of the projected Publique Administration today data on the drop in attendance in the workplace because of disease - the consumers ' association - the people of the "active good-for-nothings" continues to grow. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Publique administration, met to declare war on illegal standards contained in the decree. 
In particular, at the Tar, is disputed the exclusion of additional benefits in the event of injury because of service ; the extension of the hours of continuous hours house of sick workers, during which visits are carried out of control, and other items in the new provisions advocated by the minister. 
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "crucial prevention" 
Every day, in Italy, are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who are disabled permanently. 
In 2007, the Inail data confirm indeed, that the white deaths have been around 1,200. 
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice as many deaths that the murder. 
For the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic, the famous Anmil today, in all the Italian provinces, the National Day 58ème victims of accidents on the work, institutionalised the second Sunday in October. 
"The data provided by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirms the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," says the president of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message to the president of the Anmil, National Association of maimed and disabled labour, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses its "sincere appreciation for the voluntary continuous effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of actual workers, assistance to families of the victims and the awareness of the public" 
" Of course outraged, everyone hit the fist to stop such tragedies that, by their dimension, are the rest of the media and the involvement of the public, even though daily reality is tragic cases, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano does not deny that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is Essential to invest in education and information" 
The many initiatives promoted in school, have a special significance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people in the world of work. 
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not in evaluating the alarm on the social gravity, implement and improve the legislation. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini has pointed out how "the phenomenon of white deaths is a social urgency, who insult the conscience of all of us, and requires all institutions, to make a real effort to end quickly." 
The data on actual work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is impressive " later pointed out the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
" We do not want this " trend on the cheap " reflected in fact, a minor concern, because this is when the attention is release, that is the tragedy. 
"We believe that in general, not enough is being done in contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions." 
"We believe - stressed Mercandelli - more checks and inspections are needed, as a more important in the formation of workers, and that, at the school." 
- It has added - " that he must still make an effort as far as communication and awareness of the public. 
"But above all it takes, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers a phenomenon that is a social emergency." 
" Mercandelli then denounced " the gradual deterioration in conditions to safeguard the planned compensation for the victims of work " and " the drift assistance that the system is moving over the last few years ". 
"The objective, is to restore the worker guarantee insurance – he said - so that the fate of anyone who has an accident, should not depend on the spontanéisme or extending the legislator" 
Reader Mp3 pointing the finger, they put at risk the hearing. 
Ecouter music at full volume for a prolonged period using portable music devices such as readers Mp3, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
That heralds the European Commission, which, in a statement released in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific, on the unexpected health risks and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This scientific report - read the note - it is that 5 % - 10 % of those who, during a period of at least five years, to listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per day per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing the capacity." 
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can damage their hearing unconsciously of irreparable" says Meglena Kuneva. 
"" according to the scientific data - continuing the responsible Ue - it is a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make the information public. 
We must re-examine in addition, the existing control systems given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels has asked the independent scientific Committee, to discuss the issue, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people who are exposed to noise that they generate. 
" The scientifiques-conclue executive Ue - confirms that there is good reason to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now with the member states and other interested parties, what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard security which limit the level of noise of portable music devices 100Db, but concern is growing about the damage hearing which could derive a excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to limit these data which use solutions such as the reduction levels and the length of exposure to noise. 
The Scientific Ue remarked that users of portable music devices, listening to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for five hours a week, are currently in force on the maximum noise level made in the workplace. 
Those who are listening to music in such conditions for extended periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing the ability after five years. 
This interest 5 % - 10 % of users of these devices, and their numbers may be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.E. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission on the future of the capital. 
Today we start, we end in March, in June we learn the sums. 
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission on the future of Rome Capital," which took place this morning, the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other components of the Commission will the directives for Rome. 
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the City Council will assess the analyses and projects, so present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the "official" stamp of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"" the commission is absolutely independent ; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - is keen to emphasise Alemanno - it will propose ideas development of Rome which can use the political decision-making, which remain the Committee and the City Council. 
Any combination of roles, but only the desire for a corner which produce a great project for Rome. 
In March, it will have finished its work and will then, because this experience must have a specific time period. 
In juin-annonce the mayor - we will present the strategic plan from the work done by the Commission on the future of Rome Capital. " 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno reply: " everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is, as in France with the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on, his contribution will be crucial. 
Too often the policy is frustrated by the management of the newspaper and emergencies that occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see progress, and further, to a prospective deeper, working seriously development of Rome and its future ". 
In addition, the mayor of Rome is keen to point out that " the Commission is not an unnecessary or bureaucratic body a set: she is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to Roman city dwellers, and will study and get the best minds the Capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm or immobile, in order to enable our town, to improve, it is absolutely necessary, while also considering his future now a spirit of unity,". 
A future which, specifies the mayor of Rome, "will not be the usual local borders, but faces further" not only in view of the future metropolitan city and legal status of Capital, but "with regard to the role that Rome can and must be, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Obama? The first anti-American president. That is why. 
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: " Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had reports (as he has always today, as a private citizen) with Islam enemy. " 
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election draws nearer. 
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition". 
Obama is really rich: he believes that he will win the highest office of a nation that in all, two governors and five black senators! " 
In reality, it is attacks which does not say much ; they are obviously attacks racial nature, and not respond to the question of all voters: to be a good President? We have the polls, who all claim that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, he is still someone who speaks with the cœur and not with the brain. 
A newspaper of Mississipi, deep within the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting, we know who the American patriot will vote. 
Is that an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end. 
" Say what you want, we will be able to get the cross, about Obama or McCain. 
There are also people who swear: if Obama wins, we leave the United States. 
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the successes of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
Anyway, for all of these arguments, the winner card for the Democrats is George Bush. 
We asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq. 
America is changing. 
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 soldiers miles and was sent back home to the fesses. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, the weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to do. 
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even journalists: in the press, this is the hour losses. And many blame the Internet, the "murders" paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been arrested by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not declared the attached information, feel less concerned about the credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as they once were. 
The problem of American journalists, money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition, the losses made in the newsroom, in the room where the authors work in the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem. 
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if we want the traditional journalism as the general public sees fit, will be reduced substantially. 
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades the American journalism. 
Six in ten senior executives and journalists to printing papers are convinced that journalism at the national level are taking the wrong path. 
Localement, the executive group is 65 %. 
Printed publication against broadcast. 
Journalists are not hard to see where the Web goes. 
The largest éditrices houses their transition to the Internet, viewed by many as the "assassin" paper newspaper. 
The "economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased up to 79 percent. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hope that it "is something good" for their journalism. 
Today, the best the greatest in American journalism lies between who run the newsrooms - managers - and the reporters who work for them. 
56 % of directors at the national level, are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage fall to 23 %. 
For some, it is linked to the "job security". 
Managers who think lose their job in the space of three years, are 47 % at the national level. 
As far as journalists, we are going to 30 %. 
The "course work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13 % of journalists work under contract. 
In a great nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of take it or leave it. 
The directors are almost always great wages, while the editor can win 10mille dollars a month, in addition to the pension and insurance payments. 
As for the holiday, the logic is simple: couple days after the first year, couple days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
This is the fault of the climate. 
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA. 
The president of the second section criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the authority of the estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who was asked to leave the city, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the context of education on the Unipol-Bnl escalation. 
At the trial against him, last week, he had obtained the release house converted into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent can go the route of the city at a house in the capital. 
According to the court, such movements (the pm has not granted) would allow him to influence its society and have access to evidence that the blame. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon has already demonstrated a few days ago, with the vote in the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan for $ 700 billion approved by the White House: a good number of American was, and still is, the more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the US economy. 
And this is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its soul eve moderate, East Coast, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those Washington" and the world of finance, especially powerful in the countries of Central and South. 
The soul, rightly, that has been felt include with the vote which I spoke at the start. 
But what has been mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the big changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or leaves already run: not just the United States, but in the West, and can be not only here. 
The United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the couvés phenomena for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidifient and reveal. 
The first of these phenomena is the update, the extraordinary revival, the double state category sovereign, compared to a kind of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions that have, of course close relations with overseas, but, above all, are on a large scale involved, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in a single state. 
This creates an immediate political problem for the rules: it is like to respond to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economic world but politically, it is almost that national. 
Internationalization policy seems really out of the game or, does not have much to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is to decide any political common line. 
And so, it is the government of each state that all are waiting for speeches, plans rescue and recovery, the new rules, especially the affection of credits: when it is going through a difficult period, there is that the states have the financial resources, the volume of financial resources to try to put things in place. 
They also have the necessary resources and legitimacy to use the: two resources invaluable, elements of which no international market or organization can never have similar way. 
This new emphasis of the état-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the always important that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to give a fairly factor this element: the territoriality. 
. Paradoxalement, in effect, while we were convinced that they have now entered the realm of the network, the more sophisticated technology, the material, convinced that the global finance was now to dominate the world, we have discovered a blow to one, what our future should instead resolve its increasingly accounts with the somewhat material things like water, harvests, oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported to a place in the land, but which are linked to definitively to a limited area, a territory. 
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards that anyone who is not, in other words, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I come to the second new which provides a divide. 
Who said Territoire, state, Government, inevitably said policy, and therefore Leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand, the awareness of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, looking for someone who will take control of the situation. 
On the other hand, a wave of disrepute to the existing leaderships, economic species which proved inadequate and full of grey area. 
And besides, something more profound, in a sense, even worrying: a shadow, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of alienation that tends to involve the whole class of managers in a growing number of areas of the West. 
And rises even more convinced of the various classes, before the action is the same ideas of social elites until now their height, their way to listen to and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the word, have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of majorities. 
In short, The request leadership, feeds below, a powerful and become more ramified movement délégitimassions classes and traditional political orders, which are in the "election" revolts impromptu or, in the change of collective mood of the last few days, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, the rebellion of American delegates against Bush (and it may be that the victory of the Right in Italy is not by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, as somebody, have more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis potentially strengthens, increases and wave calculated. 
The view of all this, talk about a "current rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, frankly seems excessive. 
But it is said, keep the great eyes open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue, and in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman. 
That is the goal of various research centres American, and now, a team of four institutes almost succeeds. 
With a removed was barely 2.5 cm2, researchers have managed to maintain stuck a 100 kg on a vertical walls. 
The ETUDE - The US journal Science published the findings of some researchers in the University of Dayton, of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a development of those we know who use a special structure carbon, called nano tubes carbon. 
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have inspired the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic kinds that will ensure the animal, a adhérente perfect. 
The testing of various materials, such as glass, the Téflon, and paper glass, have shown that the new removed is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that he "stands out easily the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the ability to Ingénierie of the University of Dayton. 
MARCHER SUR LES MURS? – "this material could be used as temporary removed" adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Can be yes, but researchers believe in a much less fascinating use such as the connection between the electronic equipment, given that the nano tubes carbon are drivers heat and electricity. 
Other applications could include aerospace engineering. 
For now, no super hero. 
The AUTRE RECHERCHE - The University of Berkeley, California, is also too, in search of a new removed. 
In an article in the journal American American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented a removed formed of microfibres like hair, which car clean of dust during the movement on an area to guarantee a perfect and constant grip. 
Drugs: never with fruit juice. 
Attention to the juice pamplemousse, orange and apple. 
These drinks, consumed especially the summer because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with some medicines, in alter the popular absorbement or reducing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with very serious consequences for health. 
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juice that they are, in ' into or expenses, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs ; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of juice pamplemousse, orange and apple, to reduce the absorbement of some medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The juice pamplemousse has been strongly criticised because held responsible to increase the effects of some drugs arythmiques anti -, antibiotics, tranquillizers, anti - staminales and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE - It is the Italian Agency itself, which gave the news in a newsletter dated two years ago, warning doctors and patients to does not evaluate the danger in this mix and to pay attention to what we drink, if we take medicines such as, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
PAS QUE accurate PAMPLEMOUSSE - According to the experts, even the orange juice and apple contains substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the list of principles asset inhibited by the pamplemousse and other juice. 
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University Publique Milan: " these findings are generally, immediately reported the various national and international agencies drugs which will if necessary, change the informative notes of medicines. 
Should always read the papers illustratifs medicines that are taken, and, if anything is not clear, not to be impressed, but is clear to the doctor or pharmacist " the expert pointed out the agency Ansa. 
The Nobel in economics to Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research into the patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at the University of Princeton and it is also a well-known writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the collapse of Enron, Krugman wrote, in an article posted on the New York Times, the second event was more crucial than the first, in terms of impact on the history of the United States. 
A forecast which unleashed many controversial, and danger to the economist for years, but who now proved to be accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a bit shocked by the speed with which the memory scandals such as the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention" said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a " valuable economist ", but also a divulgateur style " very aggressive, especially critical of the excesses of the liberalization of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, this is the third edition of "anti-Microsoft package" 
This is the day of the spread of OpenOffice.org.3.0, following open source of personal productivity which aims to collect and even more users, the home office, professionals in the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the more famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a working almost a year ago, carried out by volunteers developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is the general public with various innovations: from the screen to welcome, and the journal interface and become less austere, other more important, as the compatibility born for the opératif system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard. 
Open Office has particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 following, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx.) 
Also interesting, some specific functions to certain modules, such as reducing the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send the e-mail, or import PDF queue in the module of graphic development, retaining the original page. 
On this front, it is possible to create PDF documents "hybrid" between the typical graph of Adobe format the elements of a map of calculation or a producer of text. 
The collaboration between several people is something which has had various improvements inside applications: in the map of calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes, in the draft texts, because every worker is a colour commentary for better recognition in phase review. 
Some companies are working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (the cloud, the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final outcome. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version which was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available in addition, for the opératif system Linux. 
Upon request, the cd installation can be shipped at home or in the workplace. 
And if the issue of free can be a way to spread the homes, it is in the business, that Open Office following tries the big challenge, already can count on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Not to mention the realities that offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could also be open to prospects of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent of Word ; Calc, is the map calculation which aims to replace Excel ; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint ; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on the databases ; finally Drwa is the graph module. 
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and today there are almost $ 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the number expected 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth event of doping. 
New cases of the positivité last Tour de France: the Austrian Team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and the winner of the jersey for the best climber. 
This is the site of the newspaper The Equipe who reports the news. 
Has 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera, the Epo third-generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests carried out on the test-tube Kohl belong to those made in recent weeks, the Lausanne laboratories and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the against analyses confirm the positivité the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place at the Tower and will forcement expect two years of elimination. 
The news of the positivité Kohl to Epo third generation, has been confirmed by the head of the French agency anti - doping, Pierre Bordry, who has communicated to the Associated Press, have notified the positivité the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans has placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and raflant the jersey to peas for the best climber. 
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES SE DEMANDE SI The ITALIE TSE RACISTE? 
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" met with resistance. 
The transformerait-il Beau countries into a nation of racist? It is intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for having stolen ' into a of titbits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where "more integration and more work," but also "a anti-immigrés feeling the strongest and most important support to the Lega Nord" 
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also made reference to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature sought by League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the Pope and President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict at the Quirinal, asked what the state and church work together to overcome racism." 
Etudiants victims of ladies rents, up to 900 euros for a chamber. 
The market for students try is not crisis 
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the union of tenants, hire a simple rooms can cost a student, up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
" The phenomenon has now reached the very serious to exclude entire groups of young people, the right to study because of the high overall costs that the families from must support - explains the responsibility of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani in these cities, strong demand from students has distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has amorcémême for residents. 
In most cases, the offers to hire also include a series of violations: contracts free, unregistered, without limit of rent, sous-locations. 
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through a review of taxation, are necessary to calm prices. 
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the zone Brianza, it takes about 450 euros ; for a simple, it is 650 euros minimum (area Strip Nere), at an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone) 
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a chamber around 700 euros. 
Has Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, for 250 / 280 euros a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple chamber. 
Is Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), asks about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
One cannot save that if the people living in the remote areas: 300 Euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina area, Centocelle or similar. 
Has Naples, to a bed must be 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, we spent 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
Has Bari, in bed, there are 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in cities the economy. 
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the try are often taken by students non-Community, there is a further anomaly: the rent asked the foreign students has increased by 25 / 30 % from compared with Italian. 
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historical rooms. 
Cinemas close historical in favour of Multiplex. 
"A town without cinemas is a blind city, it is as a face with no eyes" 
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, exemplifies what is happening in the big Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities, 
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the rise in more multisalles, and the death of the consomption mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is one of the major events which is unavoidable and no doubt ; it has all the hallmarks of a genuine cultural crime. 
Has disappear, it is often historic places and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends was broken, someone known, with which we have shared a way and so many emotions" observed the orchestrator of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, movie that offers Tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jurée Cannes, and told the poetry of a province, and nostalgia for a way to live cinema, lost can be forever. 
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, just want to say: these past five years, 316 cinemas of traditional have closed, and the rooms of the major cities who have particularly paid the cost: $ 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 and less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the most affected by the closure, the Emily Romaine is at the top with 82 mono cinemas lost rooms, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
Proof confirming tonnes that the first responsibility of their demise is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have been the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy these past five years, 81 in Tuscany as Emilie-Romagne. 
" The Italian exploitation has developed so irrational " observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, " it is helpful to build new structures, but we do need to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a firm room in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to the multiplex. 
Not to mention the missed credit for traders: the state of antécédente debt is around $ 10 million. 
It is shameful, and étique and morally, the Government does not respect the existing laws. 
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Notons the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a memorandum between Town Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono cinema halls of historical and centres on the outskirts. 
Among the planned prescriptive, there are tax facilities measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone to limited movement, and will have special charges for parking spaces and in some parks. 
" This is an initiative which I very fond " observed Giuseppe Tornatore " and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures. 
However, it is clear that in contrast the super power of multiplex, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of his and the image, because the public today is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is a subject that for me, has always been important: the closure of Supercinema Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that has convinced me to "new cinema Paradiso" which I thought already since 10ans. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I turn to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both experienced shared emotions, I turn on the other side not to see the signs noircis by dust. 
Links between politics and " ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of Town Hall to the interests of the clan Piromalli." 
Serious accusations made by the magistrates of the anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, with the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli's Liberal Socialists, arrested this morning to external competition for Mafia association. 
The manettes for Gioacchino Piromalli, former mediator between the clan and the public authorities, and her small son lawyer, namesake of bosses, already convicted of a criminal association of mafia kind, and pay $ 10 million. 
"An affront to the legal and regulatory moral, and especially of common sense" write prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to Maître Piromalli. 
"It would have been given to the clan - write judges - to formally enter the councils facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement public administration" 
The chairman of the committee calabrais regional Agazio Loiero, does not deny that " collusions between the local committees and organised crime, there are more of an " in his area: " there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there is also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest " 
The arrests this morning follow those of July, after which the police announced have décapitée the Piromalli clan. 
At the end of April, the City Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved ; already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been relieved of their duties to administer the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the collapse, has been appointed head of a coalition of center right, after the run-off in May 2006. 
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the local council. 
He accusa vice Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, the have manigancé all for a political issue, but given the demand for incarceration signed this morning, the justices explain that the Piromalli clan had even manages to ask variation of the draft the A3. 
Therefore the orderly interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is émergée " availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representative of a more experienced group, close to the Piromalli, unifying the choice of public administration the interests of the clan. 
When the energy from waves, now the big embark. 
That is a disproportionate source who occupies more than 70 % of the size of the planet and now the big global energy companies are starting to discover the. 
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which the behemoths like Chevron asked me, and now are trying to get their hands. 
The ability to get energy from the movement of the sea is studied for hundred years, and in the 1970s, in competition with the first oil crisis, research intensified. 
When the price of oil declined, to 1980, the idea to use the marine energy was sidelined, but now environmentalists bodies and the new increase oil give a great growth sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London ruled in 2007, that 15 % of the world need electricity could be covered by the operating systems of the seas through some choppy seas. 
That is about twice the size that produce nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there is the currents and the tides.. 
Giant to the attack. 
The first company to invest in marine energy was the Enersis, who in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, it was as a true revolutionary. 
Two years ago, always more candidates among these companies doomed always to traditional energy rely on marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the technology on the oceanic Energy said on behalf of a company associated with the American oil colossus, economic daily Wall Street Journal and it assesses the opportunities to cooperate with us". 
Cooperation in question, reaching a deliberate allowed by the American Committee for energy, necessary to give rise to a of marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. In New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, who travel the road to energy from the sea, and investments to date, although their details are known, indicate according to observers, a growing interest. 
Tecnologie to point. 
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, of the fact that the marine energy dispelling fears about the environmental impact. 
At present, the systems such as those in Portugal, or in Scotland, are small, and do not appear to be creating big problems for the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we must use the technology with a higher environmental impact. 
" And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for instance, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The waves, which is moving the sludge upward and the lower end, is converted into a water pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the cork. 
The pressure spin a turbine which in turn, provides an income. 
Energy is sent to the shore through in marine cables. 
For now, we have four systems such as phase project, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used in a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and car park using six turbines in marine of the East River in New York. 
The movement of water during the tides, runs the turbines pales, creating a rotational movement which feeds a generator. 
Verdant has announced a long list of clients awaiting permits needed to draw energy. 
After waves, tides. 
A special interest, they say the Institute research electricity, deserves at this moment, the potential of tides. 
Although he is a phenomenon intermittent, the tide is more predictable wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
And it is precisely the energy on tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, to look at the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and provides investment up to 35 million in 2009.
